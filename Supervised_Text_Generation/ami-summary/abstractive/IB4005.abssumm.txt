One team member presented her proposal regarding the room designations of the new space. In her proposal, professors received private offices, administration was close to the professors' offices, and most people were grouped by project. A second team member presented a proposal on the same topic. In his proposal, there was a lounge containing workspace for two people, an admin office which Giselle had to herself, a number of people shared offices with their assistants, and visitors were placed among students. The group discussed and made decisions regarding the placement of professors with students, the purpose of a lounge area, the possibility of putting up partitions in the lounge, the placement of Gisella and visitors, the option to have a reading room, and how to arrange furniture in some offices.
