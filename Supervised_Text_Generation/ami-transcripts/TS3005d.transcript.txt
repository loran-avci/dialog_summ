That's new one? Yep. Yep. Big microphone. Oh okay. That's the place where it's going to be, not the size. Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Of course. Mm. Mm, th yeah. Small. Shit. 'Kay. Evaluation. 'Kay, my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users. My name, my job, okay. The methods. Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven, from true to false, like question, is remote big enough, we can say it's true or it's false by steps. One means absolutely not true, seven means true. The three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are, is the remote control fancy enough, is it in innovative enough, and is it easy enough to use. And then evaluation itself. Uh. So. Okay. First question. Is the design fancy enough? Project Manager, what do you think? But does it Yeah. Think. Yeah, yeah, you can. Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top? With two batteries, the whole print plate and t and top, and if you're holding it quite a lot I think Yeah. Yeah, we have to rate. Is it fancy enough? True is one, false is seven. So fancy enough means, does it comes to the younger people and the elder people. I think Yeah, I have to agree, all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now, it's only design. And the design. So A two? Yeah, I n used I wouldn I should use that one, but it doesn't Okay, no it's two? True is a one. Very true, is it very true or isn't that true? Yeah, I think two. That's fancy enough. Then? Okay. Let's give it a two. Is it innovative? Enough. We have for the search function. The scroller a bit I think it's it's a one yeah. True. Also huh uh-huh the buttons, are they easy to find? That was a big requirement of the old people. Are all the buttons easy to find? Not only this buttons, all the buttons. I think th it's easy t Yeah, I think this is easy now. I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to to handle. True. I would rate it a Yeah, okay, that's true, that's true. But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen, you can have text. Yeah. I think it's a three. I personally think, because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use, it has to be easy to find right away. I I think if you have the button at the right, I don't think you can find the option button that easy. You can touch it. Yeah, okay, but you have y then you have here s written option on here, the teletext button, right? Okay, then okay, good. Then I think also two, yeah. Yep. It's easy to use, as well for younger as elderl elderly people. Young means sixteen to forty years. And elderly from forty eight to their death. Also if you're sixty years old Also Yeah, as well as your if you're fif sixty years old, you're holding one of those things in your hand No, but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people, so it it it has to be If you read the manual, always. So Also two? Not a seven for this? I would also say three. Remotes overwhelmed with buttons. No, that that's that's yeah. Tha that's a one, I think, that's definitely a one. No? Oh yeah. Yeah, I think isn't, this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed. True. Remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups. Yeah. That's true. Also with rubber? Yeah, okay. Yeah? That's a one? Okay. Uh I have The material used is spongy, that that's uh that's a one, that's m rubber. Yeah, I th think it's not the most spongy thing. Yeah. Remote control is hard to lose. Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old. If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone, and then you lose it, then you have lost it. It isn't hard, no. I think I think this is a two, personally. No. Isn't hard to lose. Yeah. You can't lose it. Or if you're you're sixty years old, your demands I think yeah, I think also. Huh? Yeah? Oh, okay. No. Okay okay okay. Remote control mainly be sold to younger people. Yeah? True? Very true? No, I don't think very true because the colours. We have the colours. Um we have the buttons is aren't that that much. Nah, the material isn't that So I don I think I think it's a three. Yeah, but I uh Okay, okay. I think because yeah? In the features? Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing. L_C_D_ screen and scroll. I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations. No. It's three features, basically, the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature. The microphone is a feature. Yeah, okay. I think yeah, and then you have the audio settings, channel setting, video settings. Yeah yeah. So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one. Personally, yeah. I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features, audio features, the you have all buttons on it which you'd like, microphone extra, L_C_D_ screen extra, scroll thing extra. Make it make it a two. Or make it uh a fucking two. You can see the remote control is R_ and R_. Has oh yeah, do did have nah y you have the black one. And we'll probably make also a yellow one. Maybe two. X_ marks spot. And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use. Yeah, tha that's so true. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, uh I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it. No, I'm not not convinc. Let's go th for I think it would be a t yeah, two. Now lower. So okay, we have one three, a one, that that have to got up. Two two two two two. So two, yeah. The average is a two. That is quite good in my opinion. That Ooh. Ooh. Top. Okay. Yes. No, it's two. The average is two. Yeah, I uh uh I uh saved it. f fifty five Euros. No. Yeah mm yeah, maybe. The microphone. Yeah? maybe you're going scrap scrap it. No prob. Ah. Count it? Li like write it be Ah, okay, cool. Huh? Yeah? Oh, yea yeah, you design it. Um Yeah. Solar cell. No it took a battery? Yeah. We have No, we have sample speaker. But b al but we also have sample speaker, do Oh, we already on nine. We have double curved. Single. This one is This one is curved like this, right. It's curved like this. Yeah, bu what Oh, but we have curves like it and it. There are two curves, right? Oh, okay I understand, I understand. Rubber. Push button. No, we don't have push button. L_C_D_ display. Eighteen and a half, damn. We have to lower it with six points. Twelve and half. We could use I think we should scrap the sample speaker. It's four pri it four units. But w d wha Curved then it will be square. Was that does that mean to it, single curve? Okay. Yeah, but tha that that only is one. No, one. So we don't Yeah, we also have to No, otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen. Single curved. Flat. Yeah, so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think Scrap sample speaker? That that's uh Yes, four points. Yeah, but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap? F You have to we have to scrap four points. Ma make it with wood instead of rubber? Yeah, it it i Yeah, it also uh it also takes one point less. Yeah. I think it is. Yeah. Yeah. Sample speaker. Yeah, okay, three. Point three. Huh? Point twelve. That's a scroll wheel. Yeah, but a wood we can make it brown, dark brown, not wood. Is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours. Normal colours, yellow Yeah, but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half. But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display, we have to scrap uh s advanced chip. No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make? Five? Then we have two. S touch. Then we can make add two colours on it. Yeah, two colours it. They can add two colours. But the colours. Um how ma uh the colours like l she told, is that all the colours we add or Yeah, but we we we are we have yellow, red, uh black, titanium. Ah okay. Yeah, but the rubbers alls original black. Yeah b Yeah, but we're gonna make it yellow uh red, and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now. Yeah, but m Yeah, because we have more colours than only black. I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special Yeah, okay okay, true. True, true. We have two points spare. Nee one point. Mm yep. Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped. Yep. Tap. It should've work. Yep. just tap somewhere. No? Evaluation drops. And erase the mic. Looks like a iPod. Oh. All I need is mic. Station page. I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together. Now we worked through each other, something he said yeah, and you had information I also had, so some some things I had in my presentation, they already told, so So yeah, that I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project. Yeah, no, or maybe session of five minutes together or something, and then work separate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah m yeah, like she told. Then you can work together too by mail or by, I dunno, chat, something, but now we're completely separated from each other. I don't think that was the best way, but Yeah, the technology's okay. Yeah okay, but I don I do I think becau that's because Yeah. Yeah, like the f like a plotters or something, yeah. Yep yep yep yep yep. Yeah, it is useful, but No. Yep. I didn't use it at all. I didn't use. No yeah. It is it is yeah, it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer. Yeah. Yeah. It's b bi little bit too big to write. Yeah. Fat document, those. Team work was okay. Only thing that we worked through, past each other. With some things that was only problem, but Yeah yeah yeah, but furthermore better. That's yeah, no prob. Ah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Little bit uh lo yeah. Too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema yeah. I played I think seven times Solitaire something. Wha Oh right, it is there. No, I I never got that. I always N yeah. So does this I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think, sometimes, in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do. Yeah, like I with with the remote and I never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control. Yeah, so So, yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Faster. Yeah. Yeah, it only costs four units. Uh yeah. Um Yeah. Nothing. I think we got it already. Yeah. And furthermore the the the network was okay. Everything you loaded was also av available there. So Yeah. Yeah, but that It's now half past four half past three, so Yeah, okay. Yeah, okay. Mm-hm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. No prob. Mm-hmm. I think you do. Can you find it as a J_ PEG? No. In uh Celebra Or shouldn't I? Six hundred. No, I yeah. I think eight hundred six hundred is better. Yeah. Nah, name. Hey. Oh my God. Ten. Yeah. Ten. Uh. Celebration time, come on. Peace out nigger. Entree
Beep. Oh. Uh, we should save that one. Yeah, save in the folder. Save as project. Oh, okay. Hmm hmm. Agenda. Oh, sorry. Okay. Get up stand up. just 'Kay. View. Just example colour, so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype. Okay? yeah, just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible. Uh well, it's an idea in a so. Do not forget it. To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course. The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button. Okay um we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work. Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um Yeah, you push the scroll button and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available. For example uh T_V_ settings, uh remote settings, et cetera. So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button, uh as you can see oh, it's here, just push it in, uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible. Um Yeah, that's c Yeah. Indeed. Okay, um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu, uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button, and the opportunity to use the teletext, whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu, but in uh Yes. In an apart uh In a separate button, yeah. A sign, yeah, just like Okay, indeed. Okay, we can uh modify that later. Okay. Would you like to make any comments about next uh Previous page, yeah, indeed. Oh my God. It's quite large. Okay. You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen, so it's very uh when you uh when you use it, doesn't uh become irritating to see. 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu. 'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down, so Okay. Huh. Full screen. Alright. Huh. My name, my job. Sorry, you used the PowerPoint What? Bling. Now uh the single curved idea was uh Yeah, okay, you ge um Yeah. The sideways view, uh that that that ma Ho not that pen. Not that pen. Suppose so. Ah. Oh my God, it works. Yeah, that's the single curve indeed. Yep. That's not very i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom. Uh make it uh rather thick on the top, because uh on the top it has uh the screen, which takes uh in some uh space, and the batteries can be located over there, so uh Yeah. No. Yeah. Okay, indeed. Yeah. I think so. It's pretty fancy. you get th Yeah. It's true, it's a one. Very fancy. It's very true, because we designed it to be very fancy, so It's very fancy, I think. Have you ever seen a remote control like this? No, okay, so so it's fancy. Yeah. And uh uh the scroll is rubber, so s Eno enough to I think. Huh. With the ones Yeah. Take a harder look, yeah, sure. It's easier than the regular uh remote control. Yeah. Yeah, they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button. So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most Yeah. I think it's uh it's a two, at least. It's not perfect, but A three? And why is that? It said bo both the options. Yeah. A two, a two. Uh the next question the next question. Oh my God. Yeah, I was uh Yeah. I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured. Yeah, but because it has the regular uh controls, li uh as you can see in the screen now, and uh you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen. So it's t I think it's really easy to use. You want these options to Uh sure. Perhaps that is one of the most uh Uh because a lot of Channel one, channel four, yeah. Yeah, I think it does. Because all the people who can't uh Uh a two. Sure, two. Oh. Two. Give me more. No. That's definitely our uh A false, yeah. Yeah, indeed. Yeah, is optional. Huh. Yeah. Yeah, it is it is harder to to like Geez. We're getting paid. We're getting paid. Uh. Yeah, it's a three, because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible, because it has a L_C_D_ screen. Hard to lose, yeah it sh and it's easy to find. Isn't hard to lose. Isn't hard to lose, yeah. Yeah, this this is hard to lose. This Two, yeah. And most all because of the option to Whoa. Uh. put the cor cursor on the. Click. True. True. Uh yeah. Uh Materials, yeah. Uh okay. So ma uh make it make it a two. A two? I think it's two. I think it's two too, two too too. Well perhaps not. Well, n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that, but it's for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs. Yeah, the speech possibility, the colours. Scroll options, yeah. Yeah. The easy volume up button. Remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume. Turn uh turn up the volume. Two. One two three. Right. Uh. Okay, true, yeah. I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control, because when you push on the options menu, you get the the the various options uh entirely explained. Entirely explained. Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button. Yeah, you can navigate. Uh. You're not satisfied, okay. Let's start over again then. A two. Oh yeah, I think so. Yeah. And three. The average. Yeah, I think so. Save. It's a fly. Oh m Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. It i It wasn't too much. As well as the L_C_D_ screen. Whoa. Count it. You got Excel to count. Oh okay. Well I dra uh Danny, Danny, I'll do that, because I draw the uh No, no solar cell, no no no no. No hand dynamo. Hand On advanced chip. Yeah, yeah. Single nee single curved. Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional. But it isn't three dimensional, it isn't curved in a l No no no, single curved is like this. Uh that's the only curve you made, not th uh curved like that. That's uh Huh? Yeah. Yeah, we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button, because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s Not going to work? Okay. Okay um But now button supplements. We don't got the button supplements. Damn. Okay. Nah. We could lose the scroll wheel. You could make it just a regular scroll wheel. Yeah, if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button. Normal scroll wheel. Lose Okay, so we don't exactly need the single We don't need a curve. 'S possible to lose curve. Okay. Yeah, that's meant with scr uh with s curve. The curve is uh in a dimension. If you make it a flat one, s n it's no curve, you got no curves. Yeah, okay. No, two. Oh, okay, indeed. Is it possible to make No. The sample speaker is two d wait, f s four points. Yeah, uh becau uh when you lose the Yeah. No, that's no. Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood? You don't make a remote control of Ah. It isn't. What? To knock the sample speaker, yeah. And sample sensor. But m yeah, course, but What we'll have. Let's make it thirteen or fourteen. A colour. Yeah, special colours, fruity colours. Yeah. Yeah. They don't sell green rubber plants. Alright. No no no. If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen then it's possible to make. And then you can and then you can add to the colours. Special c Okay, if you lose uh if you lose the You lose this one, you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve, for example. How d uh uh how many colours? Special colours, all the colours you want, because you want to make p Yeah, but uh when you use more than one colour, it's a special colour. I suppose. Yeah. Nee we we also want to make ano another colour. Yeah, indeed, yeah. You don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote. Hmm. Yeah, single curve. Uh. Huh. Okay. Undo, undo. Undo. So, 'kay. Twenty minutes? Okay, so you had this list at start? Alright. When did you receive this list? Ah okay. Ah okay. I suppose this is a Okay, so we lose the scroll wheel, the s And the microphone. Okay. Strange. You can only re erase? Oh. Uh, no. Bling. Ah. just up somewhere b uh besides it, right. Uh, we already try. All I need is no mic. Bon chance No, add Yeah. S Difference between lines and text and the pen. Huh, looks fucking boring now. Deadlines were sometimes very short. But And stressful. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but but why not work here together, for example? Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms? Yeah. Huh, oh right. But the technology was uh fantastic. Work now? Perhaps it is e Yeah, perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there. So you can draw uh see it over th on the screen. Yeah. It's useful, but not m Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below. Alright. The project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have, you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation. So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the Oh. Wasn't me. But I didn't I uh I used it too, but oh well. Yeah. Yeah, because it shou To make some designs, it is very easy. Yeah. But to write it th yeah. Yeah, it's too big, it's too fat. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Not too much, not too too too too. Yeah, or the room for it was the idea to be creative, so You got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out. Yeah. The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late or Yeah. Was searching and searching. No, w I didn't know Make a r yeah. Yeah. No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page. No. Yeah, more information about the costs. First of all I didn't think uh that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen uh first point, but uh it was possible uh uh, yeah. Yeah. Uh. Faster laptop. Uh. They were they were just fine. Uh. Right. Yeah. Mm. Yeah, sure. Oh thank you. Bling. You're fired. Mm. You cannot you can save it. You s uh file save as the J_ PEG J_ PEG. No. No. Okay. In about five minutes. Ah. Oh thank you. Whoo-hoo. Let's let's have party. Let's have some fun. Huh? No that uh is one thousand twenty four. Yeah. If it browse. Desktop. Mm? I do not know. Oh? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Alright. Oh. Oh.
What? Yeah. Yeah. We didn't make any uh Oh in Didn't we just do that? Oh. Hmm? We could. Oops. Yeah. Well uh we made a prototype. We first start with the overall uh This is about the total remote control. We made it green. Yeah. It's a fresh colour. And uh the screen light blue. Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under. And the R_ and R_ logo, it just says R_ and R_ now, but uh Any questions so far? Yeah. Yeah. Oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big, so people know it's there and uh Uh Hmm. You push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a Remote settings, et cetera. Yeah. Yeah. And you could also touch it so that it comes out, and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah. Yeah. Forgot. Uh well, this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen. Uh the numbers, which is pretty straight forward. We put ano an an extra button in. We can erase it, but It's the button where you can switch channels. just when you are one and you go to two, you can or if you go to five, you can go back to one with that button. Yeah, that one, yeah. It has a name. And uh uh we put that in, I thought it would be handy there. Uh this the one number or two numbers button. Below that, the page and the sound. And uh in the middle the the mute. Uh battery indicator. It's it's a bit big. And this is the uh the on off uh knop, the stand by uh knop. Or at least it should look like it. And the options uh of teletext. Huh. Yeah. Well this about it, I think. Yeah. I will put it back on the on the nice green. That's the logo of the Yeah. It's th th right now it's only R_ R_, but uh Yeah. Sorry. Oh full screen, yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well Yeah. It uh oh it's in the background. Oh. Y you should make uh a sideways uh view. It will be, I guess. Oh, we can Oh g I would smart board. Uh can I draw here or uh Ooh. So it would be uh something like this from the side, but with a bit of uh curve here, right? Yeah. So if you v flip it like this. Here's yeah. Yeah. So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger, so that it lays a bit o Yeah, that's a bit of problem maybe. Yeah. I think yeah, the battery should be in here, because it's just nothing, so if you could Yeah. 'Cause otherwise I think i I think it does. I if you don't make it green, then the elder people won't won't like it. Yeah. I think it does. Yeah. I don't know whether older people will use it, but I would make it a two or something. Yeah. Huh? Alright, it's a one. Oh it's a one. Yeah. But it's a one uh Maybe uh Yeah. Well they think it's very true, but uh Yeah, but We should perhaps That not. Yeah. I think it is, because it has an L_C_D_ screen, a mi microphone. It's from rubber. Yeah. It's a one I think. Yeah, because they're right on your screen. So you can use the b the the arrows. They're right on your screen, so I don't know where you'd search. Yeah. Well, I think they are. The options are it uh little bit harder, but if you touch the options then it's uh No they're not, but they're they're they are easy to find. Oh. Yeah. I would say yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can make it a two. Yeah, but you don't have t have to use the button on the right. You can touch it. Yeah. You you can touch options. Yeah. You can touch options and it's comes out. The uh the um Below. It's different. For young people I think it's easy to use. Yeah. I think it's In the entire mankind. Yeah. Yeah, but uh Yeah, but they they don't want the uh extra options, right? So Yeah, okay, but so they could Uh I think it is. If they read a manual. Yeah, alright. Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult. You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition, then you say the question and the answer. And that's everything it does, the speech recognition. Yeah. I think it would make it uh I would make it two. Yeah. Three? Oh. You? Oh. Well Two and a half. Three? No. No. But um I mean, that's definitely one. Oh nee, oh seven is it? It is. Yeah, uh the remote score. It's not overwhelmed. Yeah. Yep. Yes. 'Cause we make them in different colours, so that they uh Yeah. That it that it looks like wood, like something, yeah. Uh I think you can. It it feels like rubber, but Well but then when you scratch it it does come off. So that's a bit Oh we have time. What? Yeah, yeah, it's very spongy. Oh but not it's not very spongy, because it's hard rubber. I think it's a three. Hard but Yeah. You can break it. Yeah. Y yeah, you could you could call it. Yeah, y you can lose it, but it isn't hard to lose. Two. That it's hard to lose? Yeah, it it is there's the it's a six, you think? So it's a two. Yeah, you can lose it, so I don't you can make it a three I It does have an a built in function. Nee. Hard to lose. Oh right. It is hard to lose. Yeah, so then this is it is almost true, so a two. Ooh. Oh. Oh well, it doesn't. I think it will, yeah. Uh well I a a two. It's it's much more younger. Yeah. I think it's a two but Two two two. Let's make everything a two. Younger people. It has What did Yeah. Well that it doesn't. Yeah bu but I think they like the speech. You could call to your uh yeah, and the screen, yeah. Right, that that that those are features. No, aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature, and that you can change the volume is feature, and that you can change the options of the remote, uh uh something like that. Yeah. Those are features. Enough features? Yeah. I think two or three. Yeah. Yeah uh a two a two. Just another two. We like two. Yeah, there's R_ and R_ in front. Uh it's not the colour, so maybe you should make two, but it has R_ and R_. Yeah. Yeah, but not R_ and R_ yellow I think. One d on i it's the colours and the I think it is, but I don't know what you think. And you can navigate easier, because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T_V_ uh remote. Yeah. Let's make a different remote. Well Menu. A two? We only have twos. Uh just twos. One three and a few ones. Two threes. We m mostly have twos, so it's pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. I think so too. We can be happy. Yeah. What is it? It's like a bug or something. A fly, yeah. A f butterfly. Yeah. That's it. Sure. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. Redesign. No. Yeah. Yeah. So we're going to erase features or something. Do you have the cost or uh Let's hope. We're going to be here at eight o'clock. We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock. I doubt it. Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet. No, it was in my uh my information, so uh Yeah. Well, if it doesn't work I want to fill it in, but uh But you should uh direct The number of We've got a battery, one or t two batteries, or not? nee one battery, with two small batteries. Yeah. I would do a battery we do. Right? A battery. One battery, right? Electronics, simple chip advanced chip, right? Yeah, so this one and this one. Uh we ha we have um single what? Are we? Oh yay. The single. Oh the the it's not going to work uh people. We have rubber. Thirteen? With a scroll wheel, right? Is he integrated? No, eh? I don't know. Oh yeah, right, we want it to it's not it's not no. Yep. Fifteen, oh, too bad. Oh but with special colour we have. A special form, right? Oh, we don't have any buttons, so Yeah, we need to uh No, uh we have fifteen and oh, right. We could lose the curve. Yeah, I would lose the curve. But you can't push it, so you have to tap. Yeah, alright. So normal scroll wheel? And I think we should lose the curve. Yeah, but if you would i it is a new feature, it it's something special. No, the curve doesn't really No, then it will won't uh stand up from the table. Then it would just Yeah. So We would lose this one? Yeah, we could s yeah, a bit. Sixteen point three. So we still Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something? No? Ma y you just can't do that, or uh We changed th Yeah, and the single curved to uncurved. No. Yeah, but it's t Yeah, but it is uh it it is a new feature, it is something special. I don't know. Yeah, that's difficult. Yeah. Uh. We could make it titanium instead of rubber. Oh. Oh can I ask something? What is special colour? Is that the wood uh wood uh this, we have to have that one too? Th then we still have too much if we use the uh Yeah, we we scrap that one? See, a po three. We need point three. Uh it's a colour. Don't make it wood. Make it uh Yeah, but it's it's special colour, is it a all kind of colours? It's also green or uh Yeah, but it's a special colour than just rubber colour. You have to add something to the rubber to make it green. You don't say here's green rubber. Yeah, you can, you should you have to lose No, it is the scroll wheel, I guess. A push, yeah. Switch colours. It was such a great idea. What do you mean? Oh. But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour, 'cause you have to add it. Yeah, so you always lose the special colour. You co you could make it always black, like normal remote. Oh right, yeah. Yeah, we should u Yeah. We have to make this like four or five or something. That's what it means. Yeah. Oh right, yeah. Is it per remote? Yeah. Yeah, that's right, and you one colour per remote. So then it is one. No. One. So it would be curved, single curve. Or not? So y you just can't make a nice remote. It's too bad for the speaker. Should we change that tha that that's a one if not, or not? Could you copy it? And make it uh The entire uh Perhaps you can then copy page or so. Ooh. No. Oh you you made the entire could you Oh not Well. Would you? By the Perhaps you can save this one, and then copy or something. Add it copy page. Select all. Alright, something went wrong. It doesn't work. Let's forget. Yeah. Oh ignore that. Well, so Too bad. Yeah. The microphone. Yeah. A and we changed something, I guess, or not? We Oh no. Yeah, I tried to copy that one, but it didn't work. So we could fix it like tha that it's like this. You could select it all, but then you can't erase. Erase. When you saw th li uh Earlier when we selected it, w I couldn't erase anything. Just tap somewhere. Yeah. I don't think I can, but uh we can try. Oh, yeah, no, ha-ha. Yeah, we tried it earlier. It's very much work. Yeah, goodbye mic. Oh, I already erased half of the line. Too bad, oh. Like this? Still looks nice. Oh, that's erase. Yeah, that's a bit weird. Oh, now I'm line. Yeah. No, it's weird. Yeah. Bu but stressful. You think, no, my presentation isn't ready. Yeah. Yeah, you had information I didn't have and then uh Oh right. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah, you could Yeah. I think so too. Yeah, but then you can work together too when A chat would also be uh Well, I I don't really like the board, it doesn't really work great. Sometimes I think. It does work, but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh Yeah. Yeah. But Well it is useful, but it doesn't really work all the time. Th the pen doesn't The line is a bit off. Yeah, you can point to where you want the line to be. But Yeah. Yeah. I I I used it, it it was you can use it, it's quite handy I think. Yeah, I used it to y to Yeah, it did work pretty well. I don't think why you would want to use it actually, but it it does work. Yeah, and then you can show it to everybody. It doesn't really write normally. It's a bit Yeah. I think it was great, yeah. Yeah, but it was because we didn't uh Yeah. I thought it was good, but uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well. Yeah. And you get get stuff from the from the computer, but Yeah. You just sit there for ten minutes. Yeah, where is that email? Oh did you? Is it on there? Is it on there? I didn't find the didn't look but uh I didn't look, but I got like one email after ten minutes or something. That's what we said. And it not a lot uh No, the first one. I didn't know uh nee. And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here, so I went, right. Yeah. Just looking at the screen and uh Yeah, an Yeah, that will be handy. Yeah. Yea uh so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic, or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen, when you look at that. Yeah. Uh, I dunno. Think that's about it. Hmm. Heavier um less heavy laptops. Yeah. But that's not really uh Yeah. Yeah, everything worked. Yeah, but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone. Then it pops up pop up screen came. Five minutes in the meeting. No. Huh. You did? Well Oh, right. Well Yeah. Champagne. Yeah. Do we get another email? I I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again, but We do? Yeah. Uh th that that one? You can just Yeah, but it's it isn't a picture or, well, is it? No, isn't possible. But you can make a screen shot, I think. Yeah. Uh oh, export. Images. How big do you want the images? Yeah. This one? This one? Um Well it isn't on the desktop. You can only save it in my documents. Oh. Oh, alright. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Three. Can we stay here? Yeah. Yeah, alright. Why can't we stay here? Yeah.
Good. So well uh welcome everyone. Um as you may have noticed I uh created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder. I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder, which is for now the detailed design meeting. Yeah. Then I'll move this one. Oh no, this is just one big document, so you can leave that wherever it is. And we have a evaluation left here. Okay. Well not main documents this time. Oh uh yes. I have it open myself I guess. Um well the detailed design meeting Huh? We're finally getting somewhere hopefully. Um what are we going to do? I've opened it already. Um I'm still going to take some minutes, and if I'm right, you two are going to give a prototype presentation? Aren't you? Yes, you are. And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria? Good. And we have a correct agenda. And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice, the finance uh aspect, whether we can afford what we have designed, and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation, how did we work together and what are the results, and how happy are we with those. Okay, well finance uh will be later. Now I'd like to give the word to you two. So a separate button for for text, okay. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Looks good. And I just missed when I was typing The R_R_ stands for? Logo, okay. Okay well I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course. Okay, the evaluation criteria, huh? Well it's looks fancy, especially with the green colour. And the the curves which we decided, huh? Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting? Well it might work one time, huh. Okay. Okay, but we have to rate uh these things now? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also. Very new thing. Well Fancy the old people will. No, it's a two. Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves, huh? Well I'd say two on a scale No, okay well, that's true. Okay, one two. That doesn't matter that much, so make it a one. Yeah m Yeah, and you use these buttons the most, huh? So So which So which number are we going to fill in? A two, yeah? Two, three and what do you think? Okay, so we have two, two, three. A two, okay, because we have to It's the box below it, huh? Otherwise we have two results in one question. Okay, next question. Okay, you're very enthusiastic about your own design, huh? As well for the for the older people? And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition? Because that might Yeah. Okay, well M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use. Yeah, well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them. I'd say three. Okay, so we have three three two two or So what are we going to do? Okay, a three, I see. Uh Another question. No. Yeah. Yeah, but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad, because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results, so Okay, a one, because we designed for that, huh? Yeah. Yeah, and I though w we had about single colours, but you can also make uh a wood colour, not just one single colour but a wood-like thing, can't you? Whether it looks like wood, it isn't w it isn't wood but You can make a print on rubber, can't you? Yeah. So that's a one then, huh? Do you have many questions? Oh, okay well Yeah, but we have We also We have to get to the money. What spongy. Uh-huh, yeah. Yeah, so isn't hard to lose you. Yeah, but a har A hard to lose is good. So it should this question should be hard to lose. It's difficult to lose it. A two. A two. Okay. Yeah, it's okay. That happens above also. But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal, but Yep. Oh, it isn't, well okay. Remember. There. Well I think it's it's uh a lower number, so better because w we designed it for young people especially, didn't we? What do you think? Questions? Two. Uh-huh. Dissatisfy younger people. Um Yeah, but those are more fancy functions, not not really many features or something. It has relatively few features, with Yeah. Ours had other features with Okay, you think one, what do you think? You. three, yeah. I'd say three, so two it is then or Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, maybe maybe two. Well m th but the logo is on on the front, so a two, yeah, that's Oh, well that's that's pretty good, huh? That was your evaluation uh show, okay, so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results. Okay, good. Um let's see oh, it isn't asked to save but it did already And this Everything okay. Well, the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group, but I am willing to try it. Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that. And um I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder. look on that. Um and we're going to calculate the production costs, and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty, we're good, and if they're not we're going to uh re-design, but we have to do that uh very very quick I think, yes. Um I don't know if I put the Excel sheet in the n not in the folder. I think it's I think it's still in my own documents folder. Oh shit. So Okay, well this is it. Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in, so that I can also uh take minutes, and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions. Well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things. But you have to fill in this column, huh? No, uh count uh number of functions, because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots, so or different different screens, so Yeah, but it's it's more about the energy source, huh? Do you use a hand dynamo, a battery, kinetic or solar cells? We'll wait. Yeah. I'll just fill it in. Um rubber indeed? Yeah, I think that will be our best bet. And what did you change? You changed the uh scroll wheel and Oh, but it's just one point, so maybe you should should uh Yeah, you should you should drop the speech recognition. And then you can keep the curve. Or can't you? Or make it on a hand dynamo, but I don't think that will work. Yeah, mm-hmm. Yeah, but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed, yes? Yeah, but it's only a half. But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker. Yeah, but isn't it per remote that you pay? Half? I think you pay half per remote. So each remote with a special colour. I hope. So the battery, we have um advanced chip on print. Because of thing Yeah, well you can at least make it curved again. Because that was very important, huh? So it's curved, it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker. We dropped the scroll wheel. And the rest is the same, huh? Am I right? Yes. No, but you c yeah. Okay, but this this new remote we can afford. Hmm? No, I hadn't. I just received it. They don't work so hard at the finance department. Yeah, and that's it. Twelve Euro fifty. Um and did you try to make a new design, or what were you trying to do? It didn't work. Hmm. Strange. Oh, you can arrange Hmm, can't you then just say copy? New page. Paste. Yes. Select none. Okay, and now you can erase. Well it should be possible. Oh no. Well you can draw over it with white uh pen. Oh. Yeah. Sorry. Well but that's also useful for the evaluation, because I think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh design. Doodle. And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time. Let's see, we can save this now. And move back to here. Mm-hmm. And then all green. Okay, well thank you. Oh, no. Hey, but you can erase that. Uh-oh. Right. And you can't erase this? Hmm, strange. Okay, well uh just leave it at this and quickly save. Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation. We just did our project evaluation. Um well, I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide. Um what did you think about uh the process? How satisfied are we? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And you could ask things. And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what, huh? And uh Yeah. So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, probably to simulate the whole working uh process, huh, th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks. No. So you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful or Yeah, so it's maybe a bit unnatural also. That wasn't me. Uh so um the means, we discussed the smart board, and what about uh this digital pen? Yeah, well I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, um and what about the teamwork? Yeah, well I think so too. we Yeah, but that was it was our assignment, huh? Okay, and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point, the leadership. Yeah well, okay. And creativity? Well, when we look at this I'd say we have been creative, huh? But There was room for You did? Well, I didn't have time for that. At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment, and then I even got spam. Or something like that. And I was working and working and work Okay, well um but after all we can say uh we are satisfied, but it it could've been uh better. When we get uh when we have we would have gotten uh more information. Yeah. Yeah, that was a bit mean to put it in the end. And uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process? Yeah, they're pretty heavy. And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work, is what you say. Okay. Okay, so more time during the individual work phases. Um okay well uh I just got my warning for the last five minutes, so I'll move on to I guess my last slide, yes, which is the closing. Well uh, we managed, but we did it very quickly. I don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say, okay, this is it, but we had to do it, huh, because we have to have a design, and that is within the budget. And we evaluated. Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product, but we did that before, and we also evaluated the project. And I think uh everybody's uh very happy. At least I am, with the results, so uh celebration, well, for the three of you, because uh I have to write the final report now. But uh well, thank you very much for your co-operation, and I had a very nice day so far. Okay. Um Yeah I have t I think we also have to go to our own rooms again, but um well I at least. But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this, so I can try to include it in the final report. Yeah, maybe. wants to, but at least this one. I know, we should remove this, but it won't h Okay. And uh please put it in the project folder then, huh. Okay, well I uh I hereby officially close the meeting and uh I hope to see you uh soon. Well, I think we'll be a bit a bit longer, but okay. Well, happy celebration, huh? How big? Uh not too big. Whatever you think is good.
