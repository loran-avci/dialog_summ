Mm-hmm. Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh Does it? Yeah. It works. Wonderful. Mm-hmm.. Alright, yep. I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment. I I I I understand. Alright. so start Yep yes. Don't uh count on it. I think it's a mouse or a rat. Oh. Oh I know it. It's a hedgehog. Well I'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills. Yeah. I am the Industrial Designer. Chief, I am the Industrial Designer. Yeah. I think It's pr it resembles the animal drawn by. I think can I say it? It looks amazing. These are very impor These are very important documents, of course, uh these drawings, uh And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for. It looks like an uh It looks like that beast from Sesame Street. Yeah. It's it's uh Do we have to uh But we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird? No? Well wonderful. Why do I have to do the difficult tasks? Uh pen yeah that's. Uh current colour. I like uh oh they don't have pink. Oh b oh think this is uh Uh? Uh Line width. Uh fifteen. And I can draw? Uh Oh the line width is too thick, but oh well. Uh. It smiles nicely. Now I have to change the line width. Uh one. These are whiskers, you know. Uh well I think it's obvious right now. Miaow. Well if this isn't obvious I'll save it alright uh save. Uh yeah uh blank. Well I feel comfortable now. Thanks for this exercise. I feel totally at ease. Yeah something like that. So Alright. Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not, it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls, but uh Mm-hmm. No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh and numbers and uh that every culture in uh, yeah, people in every country can recognise. Alright. Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh And stereo uh s uh audio installations. Most people do, yeah. It doesn't it doesn't have to be Yeah. Well. Hmm. It has to be different and familiar at the same time. yeah the shape will will have to be recognised. I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped, but that's not uh very recognisable. Oval? I Mm. Oh but it ha it has to be m yeah. But you still have to know it's a remote and not another Yeah. Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh, yeah, useful or else uh they would have been ano another shape. Yeah. Yeah a lo the long box shape yeah. You have to use one hand. Why not? But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this, and you can make it another shape, but then you have W no w what else? I di Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then? Hmm. Well but it's still then uh the the long box, uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand, but it's it's still Yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still sort of box, yeah. It it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box, so that's what I mean. Yeah yeah I understand, but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course, but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit. Yeah yes I thought about something like that. Yeah. A big recognisable button on top or something. The buttons should uh also be not too small, not too big, of course, and uh n uh uh not too close uh together. Uh-huh. Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions. Yeah. Colours, yeah. I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um. Already thought about something tha Mm-hmm. Yeah now we can still talk about the material, we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course, hard plastic, the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh. No n n Mm. Alright. And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other. I think so. It's a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam I think. It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things. And have well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works. The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly, but that's pretty obvious, I think. Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh b a simple colour not not very flashy. Pink television sets pink remote,. Alright. I must not forget my pen the next time. Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task, yeah. Yeah I uh w was wondering that too. Y you went to the company website. It's the the the start uh starting page uh Very handy to know. Right see you in half an hour then. W Right uh see you in thirty minutes then.
I dunno. Throwing away my toothpick. 'Kay. Nice user interface. 'Kay. Right let's see it. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Alright, your favourite animal? Grizzly bear. Yeah. We're kinda losing time, though. We're losing time, but Alright. Do we have to guess? A hippo? Yeah. I don't know how to call it. A hedgehog?. Alright. Thank you. It's. Yeah sure. It's a rabbit. Well Looks very nice, right? Yes. Yes uh right. You go man. Alright. I should have made mine a white rabbit.. You're standing in front of it, I can't see it. Alright, thank you. Yeah it's a bird, but what kind of bird? You have to push harder. Release your anger. Hmm. It's a cat. It's a pig. Right. No it looks great. Just save it. Oh great. It's good for group spirit. Right. Right. I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors. Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control. On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce. Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control. Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world, for different cultures, maybe, because we want to we want to well fifty million? Yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it. So Yeah. Yeah that's right. Mm-hmm. Right. Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something. Yeah right. Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that. Yeah but We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh Yeah but it's it has to be useable. Yeah. No.. Not with two hands. Yeah yeah yeah, right. No Yeah but it's quite important that it fits. Yeah. Yeah. It shouldn't be boxy. Nah I don't agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand. Yeah. Yeah but if you shape it If No that's ol old fashioned. I can imagine that us Well Yeah right. It fits in your palms. Hmm? Um.. Well Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand. It shouldn't be too boxy, you know. It's No no no. Yeah. Yeah it should be Right maybe something like this or and then a button here to switch between different systems like D_V_D_ player and so you can I've Yeah right, and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and Right. But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button. So there has to be some space between the buttons. Yeah. Yeah right right, and maybe we should use colours. Yeah. That's kinda trendy. Yeah right. Right. But I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make, so we Yeah. No problem. Yeah. Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah. Yep. And you can use Yeah. But are Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea? I think we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it, you know? You can use it just plain but you can To make it more trendy. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah right. Yeah yeah yeah. But people of often don't like bright colours or something. We have to make it grey or s or black. Yeah but then you can use a a front. Yeah that's right. Yeah or a t Teletubby front. Yeah yeah yeah. I will investigate. Right. It's Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer Yeah. Well that's great. Thirty minutes. It's totally broken. Oh.
Hi there. We want to erase it. Thanks. Big bird. Mm. Uh no I don't. It's just a bird. Here you go. Mm. Width. Hmm. It's a pussy cat. It certainly is. Easy to learn. Yeah. Yeah. I also think we should not add too many buttons. Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think. Precisely. Yeah. Yeah indeed. Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use, we uh we make? Yeah. And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes. So we can keep that in mind. W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it. Yeah alright, but Yeah. Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour, that kind of things. Well we we could make more more oval or something, and and Yeah or so Well yeah it's new. but young people want something different and it is Yeah. Yeah alright. Yeah. Yeah it doesn't fit. No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped. They're all um Well Yeah. Yes uh Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end, and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end. Mm. Yeah it Yeah yea Hmm.. Yeah. Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them, and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs I dunno but Well. Mm... Yeah that's bad, yeah. Yeah that's important. Yeah. But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country, so. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Mm. Well you can make profit with them, and it's a way to make them trendy. Yeah alright. Yeah normal. No a colour everyone accepts. Mm. Mm. Yeah. standard. Well young people s li Yeah yeah, yeah. Yeah. What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't get Yeah. Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it. Yes. Next meeting is in Thirty minutes. Yeah alright it's it's handy to know Oh. Goodbye. S.
Yo. Ow. Uh Yeah. What the Uh Yeah well, ja well let's just start. I've uh made a presentation uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard, so we can all see it. So it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here. Well. Very nice. Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting. So uh I'm the Project Manager, so I had to fill it in, and uh hmm. Oh sorry. And an uh a nice agenda. Uh we'll do the opening and then uh we'll meet each other, what uh we already do, so, that's not uh very much trouble. I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here, so that we can all use them. Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction. We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project, and then uh we'll close the meeting, and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here. So this the opening we'll uh We have to uh design a new television remote control. You have heard that uh already I think, so. Um we want it to be original, so a nice uh a nice new design. Uh trendy, it's also for young people, and we have to just uh make it uh modern. And uh friendly, so size does matter. And uh Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place, that kin those kind of things. Other uh There happen to be uh three stages. functional, conceptual, and d detailed design. Um so every time we we'll do some individual work, get meeting, talk about it, uh and then go into the next phase. That's just it. Um We have uh these two Smartboards. Um well as I just showed, there's a project management folder, a project document folder on the desktop. It just works exactly the same as a computer. You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop. So you can uh make uh Words Excel, everything. Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things, you can uh draw. This is a uh well a drawing board. you have a these different uh functions on the board. You can see them there. So you have a a nice pen, and it's works just like a bal ball pen. This is just a. I want to uh Oh yeah. Of course w doesn't work any more. Yes I will eraser so. It's fantas fantastic. We can uh uh well you can save a file. So if uh we draw we have to save everything. Don't throw anything away. Uh just we can start a new one, and we just go on, and don't throw anything away. Just uh let them all uh stand here. We can delete, but we don't do that. Um you can here select a pen, you can draw anything you want. It's a bit uh childish you have to write. It's not as fast as you w you know it, but it does work sometimes. Well it's just like a normal uh paint. So it's gone. Well we are designers, so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard. So that's fantastic. Um well this uh speaks for itself. We going to try it. So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board, not my idea. Yes our your favourite. So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo, but I'm going d I'm not going to. I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast w I dunno what I'm going to design. Oh um doesn't oh. Yeah, 'kay. Hmm? I just said it's not my idea but I am the Project Manager, and officially this is my idea. So what? Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose, loosen up, a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah. Sh I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because uh this is uh No so a a few legs. Yes yes guess. Well I should make it an hippo now. No I don't think so. Well what is it, huh? Yeah difficult English word. I didn't knew it myself. Our characteristics sum it up. Well it's uh very uh painful those kind of thing. So we can uh just uh We're going back and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal. Huh. Oh uh but this uh marketing designer. what kind of animal is that then? Uh it. Yeah. No no no. What are you going to do? No no. No no save it and start a new uh save it and start a new black uh doc a blank document. Yeah well we have to save everything so now um the next one uh and then save it and start an blank document. Yeah. There's also different colours and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness. So um well you should uh try it but uh Well y y y you could have but uh. It speaks for itself. What the uh just a duck. Nice. Is it a duck? Is it a plane? It doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh. Yeah just a bit a bit childish, a bit. Well uh save the document and then uh And then a a new blank document for. uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it. No well first yeah. And then you go to format I think, and current colour you choose a new colour. And a new pen width uh also format. It's not like in paint. Line width. And you can choose a nice one. Width width. With each other. Yeah. So. Just a wa that's the way we do it's quite easy. Mm-hmm. Oh Pussy. Well then you change it. And erase things. What? Super pig. So Yeah yeah yeah we know. Yes alright. It's a cat. Well well um Yeah save it and start a new blank document. Yep. So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it. Well it's terrific, eh? Yeah that's it. We're one big happy family now. Well then uh the serious uh stuff. We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars, but uh twenty five Euros. Our profit aim is, worldwide, fifty million Euros. So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell. we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so, keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff, and uh marketing uh research. Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls, first about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera? Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait. We can uh take notes and uh Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls? Please? No uh I did. Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yep. That's alright. That would be a nice idea, yes. Yep yep yep. Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit, so. Yes. I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now. Well yeah? No that's right. Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's culture uh international. Yes. Yep, and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player. Don't we have uh other uh ou Uh. We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw. Yeah. Yep. Well yeah. It doesn't have to be, but we can. Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_. Yeah because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design Yes. Yep. Yeah. Oo N we can use uh it as a as a game pad. So one hand has the beer, so the other hand uh Well i we already uh one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market. So the the form will have been uh tested out so Yes. Well for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them. I have uh have to it has to fit my hands. When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here. It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb. Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those. D_V_D_ players. Yes. Well A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand. That's We have five minutes left. So Yes uh that's yep. Yep. Ha. Sound nice. Yes. Well it's just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera. Yes? Yes. Well thirty minutes we have. So um This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh. You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh. I think. Oh and uh that's uh that's all. So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over. Yeah yes say. Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone. So it has to be made in the buttons I think. It has to uh not be loose. Yeah. Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh It's not that in China it's different? Yeah. But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between Yeah. Probably yes. China rules. Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes. Yeah. Yes. Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it, but you can change them uh when you buy the And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh. Yes. Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell, so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so. Yeah. Well if if you yeah. If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it. I think. But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh. Yes. Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be, but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote. And you will look into the technical design and um form, I think. Or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Euro? Well it it it's if you uh Finish meeting now. Oh alright. Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so In thirty minutes, but uh I think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here. I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh it's it's the half of the normal size. Oh right, oh. Ma W that was a nice meeting. Yeah, see you.
