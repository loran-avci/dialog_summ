Hello. Oop. Okay. Okay, we're just going to the later. So we're going to talk about the conceptual model. So that's me. Uh okay. So Uh okay. Okay, so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes, minute. What's it called, I dunno. Whatever. Okay, so we just talked about uh Oh you want me to show that there or Okay, we just talked about it looks. Has to look nice. Usability is very important. People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones. Um It has to be very basic, not too many buttons. Light switches on if you use a button. Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility. And it has to be easy to learn. That were the things I uh make minutes of. And the functions are volume, channel to choose channels, an on-off, a mute uh button, and a text T_V_ button. That are the functions. That right? Okay. So I just want to give you uh Mike again, the first uh presentation of your Yeah. But we already have the flashing flashing light on the Okay. Yeah. Hmm. But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea, because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. So it has to be flexible. That's a good That's a good idea. If it's de like that. That's good, a good idea. Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control? R_ soft. Okay. Yeah. It's very uh difficult to to to do it. Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control. Okay. But that's definitely more expensive than Yeah, but a telephone Okay, yeah. But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros. So uh Yeah, just modern modern but still uh basic. Yeah, maybe the teletext tel No. Yeah. Yeah. But it sounds very difficult to use. Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it. So you can't use your thumb for it. Yeah, down there. But it's not not the best best. Yeah, for volume. For volume, or a channel. Yeah, why not. And the channels as well. Oh yeah. Yeah, that's better. Yeah, just th th th other buttons like text T_V_. Put that on the button bottom. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Except from the on-off button. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool. Okay. We have to decide this this lecture, or this this this uh fifty minutes, yeah, how it is gonna look. Okay, so Hmm, okay. Yeah, we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control. So the colours also. So we have ha to ma make it in black, black, yellow. Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black. We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front. Yeah, it's cool. Yep. And still trans Still still transparent. Okay. Yeah, we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material. Uh I'm not sure. Yeah. Just give five with them, just in a box. Five different Yeah. Cool. Yeah. It it could be like a Nokia, like plastic. That's better prob Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's cool. But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material. Just only the basic uh basic remote control from normal plastic, and the rounds of it from softer s I dunno. Y Cool. Yeah. Y i if you The numbers could be can be Yeah, that's right. They can choose. Blue. Yeah, but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it. You have to choose Is it Okay. Yeah, okay. Maybe put some different ones in it. Doesn't matter. It's just No, just some LED. Okay, cool. Just make it some different colours. Blue, red and green, or something. Yeah, we have to hurry up a bit, so Okay. Yeah, a recharger maybe. We still want to have a recharger, don't we? Is that still the A recha Oh no. Uh Battery. It's just a battery. Yeah. No, just rechargeable batteries. But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch. It's dark in the room. No. It's just batteries, that's cheaper. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. But it doesn't really matter, we just make it plastic. The scroll wheels, that's cool. That's for the volume. Yeah. Okay. I don't think that's an opportunity. Just skip it. Because we don't have time for that to to put it in. Yeah, okay. Okay. Oh just sk Maybe you have to skip that one as well. It's No. No. Yeah. But maybe the form has to be a bit different. Not the sh the square form. Just a bit more rounded. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. So We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these. What exactly. Because we have to know it. So the energy uh is the recharger. We already know that. Just a normal battery. Okay. The chip-on-print is a normal one. Okay, the case is just a plastic one. Yeah, re Yeah, regular. Yeah, okay. Yeah, regular. Okay. And we need a plastic case, with a scroll wheel. That's pretty much it. And a flashy light. So uh I'm not sure. But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment. But Yeah. That's for the next one. That's for th Uh that I think that's the next next meeting. But you definitely get a specific instruction. But th think about something that's more rounded. Just And more It has to be Uh a bit. Just just on the top or on the bottom. Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this. O um if you draw it like this, you get a What the fuck is it? Okay. Mm Doesn't work. You see what I mean? If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than Nah okay. Just. Maybe you can make it like this. And this is all the wheel for volume. So that you just um It's all rounded, so you can do uh turn this one. Yeah, but just not on the top, but uh on the side of it. Maybe, I dunno. Okay, so we have this at the moment. Okay, so we'd have this. Is that okay? And Like this. And uh what's the channel choose? Where do we uh put that? Still on the bottom or That's the numbers. It doesn't make a difference, if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other. Because you already have the volume here, so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there. Next to each other. back and forth. So you can also can put it all on the top, and this, you keep this empty. Because you have to hold it as well. But that's not want to zap very quick, so Yeah? Is this a opportunity, or you don't want a different Why? But still the next It's still the next one. Doesn't make Yeah, but fo from left to right is exactly the same. It ma it doesn't make a big difference. But it's exactly th I dunno. I You already have the volume on the side, so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake. So it's uh So but that's for that's for you, 'cause it's Okay, so hmm. What did What else we have to discuss about? I dunno. Yeah. And the LED. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Uh the logo was has to be on there. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, five. Let's give five. So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger? Is that is that a good good opportunity? So you could put it like that, okay. Uh I'm not sure. But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. That's all. Yeah. Just round it up. No. Yeah. Yeah. No, just just the corners. Okay. Shapes. It's a bit annoying, isn't it? So we have to make a decision, what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have. And you have the scroll button inside. Okay. But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then? Of Skip that one as well. Okay. Yeah, it's cool. Rubber spongy. Okay, so we have s still one minute left. So just I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square. No. But I I think it's still for older people. You j still have older people. It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that, like f Whatever. Just you have a normal But i it is it is it is already fancy. Because of the lights on the bottom of it. That's already fancy. Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel. Make it in in yellow or something. Just like the colours of Real Reaction. Yeah. It's right. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe the ones we are going to draw there. Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this. Because it doesn't work properly. So maybe you have to ask her. Okay. Yeah. That's probably Okay, so just finish it. So we make it a bit like m that one probably. Yeah. Is that okay? Okay, only the colour and the flashy light and the We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition. Or keep that? It's okay. But you'd definitely need a advanced chip. So Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well, okay? Yeah. The function of that in there. Yeah. And we need a Probably we need a uh advanced chip then. But it doesn't say anything about it, does it? It doesn't has to say anything. Just You have to just talk to Okay, we have to stop it now. So just Okay, that's a r That's that's a advanced Yeah, we just decide not to put it in, because it's too difficult. Okay, we just put it in, because it's a good feature. We have to stop now. Okay, just We have to stop it now.
Bonjour. Why? Okay. Check check check check. The power light doesn't work. You turned it off. Okay. Oh. Hmm. Uh Shall I start? No. Okay well I received an email Okay. I searched the web, uh and uh I searched uh on this d document, recent investigation of the remote control market. It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe, I forget it. Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel, instead of the current functional look and feel. So it's very important for us to create something new. So what Michael just said, it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls. Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. Uh this uh aspect is the most important one. Uh it came out of the research. It uh is twice important as the following. The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative. Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features. And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion, because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition. But um this is the second uh important uh aspect, and I think uh we must use some of the new technology, to be uh innovative. Uh maybe maybe something new. We have to discuss about it s uh Okay, uh features not uh do not exist in current remote controls. And that's very hard I think. Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use. But uh that was an overall uh point. We already discussed that. Um I've got one picture. Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy. So I took uh that part of the webpage. And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy, yeah, uh have detected the following trends. This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us, maybe. But it's about uh clothes and shoes. But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy. But spongy, what what does spongy says? Spongy. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's something that uh it stand there. But I didn't knew uh knew what it means. So spongy means y Yeah. So it's also a stress-ball. Uh Okay? What do I think? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control, I think about changeable fronts. Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front. Because it's uh it's hot. And uh some basic uh colour fronts. Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something. Uh maybe an extraordinary shape, like a sponge. Uh or uh, yeah, just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has. Just uh something round in it, or uh maybe not uh not uh Yeah, I dun dunno. We have to discuss about that. Uh y yeah. Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative. Yeah, how do we do that? Maybe speech? We ma must have some kind of gadget. So Intro Yeah. Yeah, that's the problem. That's the main problem. So Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations. Okay. Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then. Oh. It's mass production. So you can say, you can Yeah. But how uh we we're gonna make many of those. So we can start a mass production, and then the cost will still will be. Yeah. Okay. That was this? No, I don't uh I don't like it. Okay. Square. Like. Mm. Oh yeah. Uh uh Yeah. The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls, uh the buttons are part of the uh the style, I think is part of the remote control itself. It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape. Uh it's n doesn't Is uh a button uh um How do you say it? It it didn't it i it don't come out of the on the background. It is in uh the c a remote control uh Yeah. Yeah. Uh i Yeah, but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control? You Hmm. Okay yeah, you can you can change Yeah. No. Ah cool. Okay. Okay. Mm Uh but we have to do something about the trend. The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh. And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two. Uh yeah i Just Just on front. Neith uh I don't like it uh neither. Yeah, that's not not It's not al uh always the same. Every remote control's uh different. Yeah, we have to care that it r uh looks really new. Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control. 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside. Yes. Okay. And a bit uh Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then? Uh five or something? Or more or And um uh uh buy the product. You buy, you get one. And uh basic. Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project. Yeah, you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station. Yeah. Yeah, we can b It c it could be just just a square, just a packet. Yeah, but that's a round one. Maybe we can choose then. Yeah. Yeah. What do we do wrong? Hmm. Just just more like this and not uh a square. Okay. Yeah, it Uh it's very annoying. Okay. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh the t the trend is spongy and fruity. But yeah. It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh Uh It The th th Yeah. There is one There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original, and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself. It must have uh uh uh a very different Yeah, they're all the same. Uh yeah, but uh if you the f uh front, the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow. No. If you set the pen yeah, he will draw here. Doesn't work. Yeah, I'll see it. Uh No. Oh that's hard. But Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said. We have to be original and uh technological innovative. Becau Yeah. But Ma But we don't have any f information about the cost. We started with information about the cost was now th And how much is the chip? The the the And how how does it work? Is it No. Does it say does it say something back? Okay. Um Yeah. Fine.
Okay. I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials. So I'll discuss them with you. Yeah. Mm no. Yeah. Hmm. Spongy. So rubber, kind of. Yeah. It's like a sponge. Yeah, somewhat like Yeah, I've some uh material uh information, but I'll give you it later in my presentation. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost. But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement. Oh I got an email uh And it says uh the chip can be uh simple, regular or advanced. And Um They say uh a display requires an advanced chip. And this is more expensive than all the other chips. So it's m the most expensive. Yeah, it says in the email. The display requires an advanced chip. Yeah, probably too. I I haven't got anything about speech recognition, but Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip, we need. If we're doing uh if we're doing a display. Hmm. Hmm. But it That's on on the display. I think it is on uh on the bottom too. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I've I've got something of that uh too. Scroll. Yeah, or uh maybe uh The channel buttons are often used. And you can't use them now with your thumb, because the thing is not, it's not easy to control. Yeah okay, m maybe we cho should put that on top, and buttons we we don't use on, in the bottom. Because uh you can't hold it. You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons. But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons, like one two three. So maybe we can put that on the bottom. Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time. Yeah okay. That's that's good, but Yeah okay. Yeah. Hmm. No, I think th the the top buttons are okay. They sh Those should be on top. But uh we we can switch those two, yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah, we have to keep it simple. Okay, the component design. I looked at uh some similar devices, and uh my own common knowledge. So uh this was on the web site. If you aim at a young public, you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green, blue, red. So flashy kinda colours. Uh shapes should be curved, so round shapes. Not Nothing square-like. Yeah. Yeah, but mm is uh has round corners I think. So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing. Yeah. And um sports and gaming device style characteristics. I don't know exactly what that means, but it should be, well yeah, popular kind of looking, I think. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, mm n Not that weird, because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy, to attract a young public. No, okay. That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes, but We have to use uh kind of flashy colours, I think. Yeah. Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue and Okay. Well this is a remote control, a very old one. Um Then the components. The case has just a Here's black. But we are making it uh Yeah, I dunno. Maybe. But anyways uh it should be transparent. We decided that, huh? S Okay. Yeah, we could do that. Yeah, but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent. So you can still th look through it. Um the buttons. Normal rubber I think. Like normal ordinary buttons. Soft. With the hard hard buttons. Okay. Yeah, it's it's all on one level. Yeah, on one level. Yeah, I know what you mean. So we have to keep it on the one level. Like th the top it's Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay, it's chos So that should be hard plastic. Then the buttons? I think. Or maybe Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And um Then the L_E_D_. The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient. And back light L_E_D_s. So But I think we have to make the case transparent, otherwise the back light won't work. So if you put Okay. Yeah, but we can still make it transparent. So Or no Yeah okay. Good. And in green colour, the back lights or Yeah? No, but I think there are multiple colour LEDs. So I I know I dunno. Is Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive. I think it's Yeah, I dunno. Maybe it's too expensive, but it I th I don't think so. Then uh some more technical things. I don't know what it is, but it should be there I think. Um this is the normal circuit board, like a chip board in in a lot of uh things. W So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators. There's all these kind of things. Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls. So I guess we j we just need that. I don't know what they do or Nah, but they just said we need it. Uh the battery contacts, like normal batteries ca you can put in. Yeah okay. Yeah but Yeah, but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it? Accu. Y uh just just batteries, rechargeable batteries. Okay. Not a separate Okay. And uh a chip, that's this one. Then uh I received some possibilities. Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch. So it operates on your wrist kinda. If you hold it. Yeah, I don't think it will work, and Or we can also use solar cells. But you mostly use it indoors, so Yeah, and and we can use the home station kind of thing. Um cases, flat, so uncurved. Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back. And three D_ curved is also in depth. So that's possible. Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls, we must use rubber buttons. So we can't use the flat buttons. Yeah, I think. Um these kinda materials can be used. Yeah, I think so too. Yeah, scroll wheels um Yeah, that's good. We can use multiple scroll wheels, w if we want to. But I think just the volume is enough. And uh the L_C_D_. So we need uh the expensive, most expensive chip, if we use an L_C_D_. Okay, then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip. So th so the regular chip. Because we use scroll wheels. And um Yeah, that was it I guess. Uh are are we using a a rubber case, or We haven't decided yet. L Yeah, i it it should be soft. You said so? So just hard plastic? Okay. Titanium, uh I think it's too expensive. Yeah, you can make it curved or mm round. But just in two D_, not in depth. Yeah. Yeah th yeah, the chip is the the regular one. You have the simple one, regular and advanced. So it's b should be regular uh the second. I think I'll just check it. Yeah. Mm. Or should we do it in the next meeting? So we should did it here? Or should we do it in the next meeting? Okay. Yeah. What? Oh. Okay. Like a very big scroll-wheel. Okay. Hmm. I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted. Yeah. I think it's probably better. Yeah, but maybe we can make a a plastic, so that you i if you like drop it, it won't change the volume. Only if you use your finger. I think in middle. Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom, and and the switch channel in the middle. Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below. Yeah, okay. Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other, so Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up Yeah, but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up, and down button is If you put them But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with uh channel changing. In uh On most on most remote controls. So so if we use that, they will probably have a long learning uh time. I dunno. Okay. Yeah, but i i it should be round in in shape. So No, tha that will be Yeah, so top down. Hmm? Do we have to design that w as well? The docking station? Hmm. Yeah, just a recharger. But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well. Oh yeah, okay. Of the remote control? Yeah Yeah. Yeah, but we can we can do all kinds of uh As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes. Not in depth. Yeah, but Yeah, if if we want to make it kind of, yeah, new. Yeah, but we could do a lot of, lot more curving. I would do it Like in this kind of shape or I dunno. I dunno if it's handy. This? The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing. Mm. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, though that's a trend. If we want to make it. But yeah, I'm not a Trendwatcher, you are. So Spongeball kinda. Okay. Yeah, I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff. Yeah, but we're we're aiming at a young public. Hmm. Yeah, we could do that. Yeah. S Uh yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I think so. And we we have to build in a microphone and Yeah, and I do I don't know anything about that. I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition, so Fine. Yeah, we probably do. No. Yeah, uh I have I have some some information about the cost. But just a about the chip. I don't know how much, but Just in inexpensive or But i it's a separate chip. Yeah, I don't know anything about this, but Nah. I dunno.
It's It won't wake up. Yeah. I was a bit early. Like What? No, I just came in. Uh normally I was one of them. Come on. Why won't it wake up? Is it on? But how? Ah, there it is. Uh. Yeah, I received an email as well. Which one was mine? The minutes. No, just tell us. Yes. Hmm. Yeah, more. Well, I'll I'll get back on it. Spongy. Spongy, like sponge. Uh soft materials. Yeah, but Yeah. Soft, sponge. Yeah, but Yeah. How are you gonna make it? Yeah. Yeah, I'll get back on that. Well, I got f also an email from the the technology department. They have done uh research about it, and uh even more possibilities now with speech. So they recommended using it. Well I'll check what they exact mean. So uh Yeah, th that's the only problem. I d They don't say how much it will cost, so Um but uh if we implement uh speech recognition, I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well. Since you have to uh configure speech thing. Yeah, that's that's something I dunno. Yeah, so uh we gotta de We have to decide on that. Mm uh L_D_C_ doesn't require Okay. And speech recognition? Advanced. Yeah. I'll I'll give you my design. Yeah okay. So we Well we can I had uh to make a sort of a design. So I did some searching on the internet. I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls. I think we should um This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment. I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players. Mobile phones. More modern. Y yes. Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller. 'Cause remote con control, you can see it here, you have to bo reach both out both sides. And here you just have one, few buttons. So that's that's the main difference. But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this. And then changeable fonts, so It's the most important part, I think. But And the home base is something like that, something simple. Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit. Uh basic buttons. On-off, mute. And th maybe two others, I dunno. Text buttons. Yeah, text button, maybe there and there. And then the colour buttons, if we want it on. I don't find it very usable, but it's Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well. So and then yeah we saw the the pla display, in the the iPod. They can put the basic buttons, one, two, three, four. And uh f above ten. And I think No no. That th there is no display there. But it's on the place of the display. And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part. So the focus is on these two parts. So you don't see all the buttons you else need. Uh well um This is how it is now. Um Here uh Well we have volume. Yeah. Well here we have also side scrolls. I dunno if we can use that. Do we want to use For volume? Well then we can even simplify it more. By just putting the volume on the side. And and just channel buttons here. But I think uh Well. Yeah, well it's Basically it's it's here. They're on top? You mean uh these to the low? Oh okay. Well, yeah. Mm Maybe. I dunno, but yeah we'll Yeah, maybe it's not easy if it's below. It's harder to zap. So I think uh it should be should be easy to. I think it's pretty standard, these rubber buttons on the top. And uh if you don't light 'em up, they don't uh you don't see 'em very good. I think it's modern to light this area up, and to light this area up. So the focus gets on these parts and not on there. But uh the position of course can be different. It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use, and how it's easier to use. So we can uh switch these to I dunno if it l will look good, if you put those on t on the bottom half. Okay. Yeah, maybe Those two, yeah. And uh, yeah, you have to make sure it's easy to uh Yes, it has to be big enough so you can hold it, right. Well that's that's my findings. So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look. M_P_ three player. And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something, we I don't think we should put it on top then. I think that, if we're gonna put in more technology, that you need to be able to uh switch it open. To use So if you put in uh speech recognition, you need so more uh many more buttons. Which won't look good on the front side I think. So that's something we have to decide on. Yeah. What we're gonna do. Okay. Yeah well uh iPod is trendy. And it is well curved square. Okay. So not Yeah okay. Not uh the old uh box look. Mm Yeah, it's Black yellow control. Yeah, but uh I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together. But Yeah, okay. Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts, with all with the the logo on it? Can we do that? So Yes. So Yeah. But with all with logo on it. Yeah. Well one of the options. You can Just like a mobile phone, you can make um different fronts on it. So you can just replace them I think. That was the idea, or just uh release one. Yeah, uh Or just uh sell different ones. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I uh I dunno. A more Yeah, just uh I think uh rubber really has an odd look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like mobile phones. Like uh the iPod. Uh just I dunno what uh kind of material it is. But Oops. Yeah. Yeah. Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh Yeah. Or it runs the whole Yeah, you can halfs transparent, or just that it's comes out a bit. Different, I think, also. Blue or red. Whatever you want it, I think. Uh depends on the colour of the Yeah, that's true. But Yeah, it can. 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well. I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone. And I can change the colour of it. Well, we don't put put in any fancier technology yet. So I'm sure we can fit in. Yeah. Yeah okay. We just Yeah, we have to make sure to uh Yes. Yes. Re recharger. Base station. Yeah, batteries. Yes, rechargeable batteries, I think's best. So if you hold it, it gets powered. Mm. So we need uh two D_. Yeah. Yeah. Uh For channels it's not handy, because you scroll too fast. Okay. Uh I don't think a rubber case looks Yeah, okay. That Uh fruit and veg, or Yeah, fruit and veg can be just the covers. So you can the the spongy yeah, I dunno. I can't imagine a soft remote control. I just can't imagine it. Yeah, I think. Titanium. It's mentioned here uh. Okay. Yeah. We have batteries. Regular. Yes. User interface concept. I dunno either. Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board. So we're staying here? Okay, so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again? Yeah, uh I dunno. But the iPod and etcetera, M_P_ three players, mobile phones. Just a bit cur Okay, I'll see if I can see any of those. Yeah, you Yeah. Yeah, that's a little problem, of course, as well. Yeah, maybe you just have to make it uh That's not scrollable too easy. Uh wh what is the middle part? Numbers, okay. Yeah, I agree as well. Use the dz Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I think uh zapping is the highest priority. And then you use those uh Yeah, of course uh. Yeah. I I think it's It's it's obvious, I think. Yeah, I think No, uh I think Yeah. I think it's s so simple you just Yeah, okay I'll d I'll take a look at it. Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again? No, you have uh It is Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic. You have to look at that image of the iPod. More that uh kind of style. Not not the old grey black Where you can put a ve Uh we have If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo. Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh Yeah. Um I think Yeah. That's your choice, I think huh. Yes. Yeah, I think so. But th Yeah, that can be very simple. Least. Yeah, just where you're around something. Li Yeah, we had one example. Mm. Mm. Which w Here you see one that's very round. So I think that can be all kind of shapes. Yeah, so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod. But More rounded. Yeah, I think it will just look like more like this one. Since it's This is also rounded. I think i Yeah okay, tho those are al already a bit cornered. Mm Yeah okay, but then we have to think of something totally new. I've uh I had a lot of picture of old ones. And all curves have already been done. Yeah okay, yeah well Yeah. I know we can do a lot more, but I think it will only look more like the old remote controls. Yeah. Yeah okay. But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here what the old ones look like. Curves, curves. You've more there as well. It wasn't very small one. very simple. That is for elderly. I think if w My opinion. If we just uh take the iPod, and the same look. So uh light or just whatever colour, but the same light colours. And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new. No rubber buttons or something. Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look. More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player. Yes. Just a simple scrollb Doesn't have to be. Yeah. No. Spongy and Mm. Yeah, idea. But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now And if you make it look like the iPod Yeah okay. So that's already a very big change compared to Ye yeah. Well uh Could. No, I think Oh. Think the scroll wheel won't be very big. Since if you put it uh somewhere, the chances that it will scroll are too big. So it will just be a small small scroll wheel. So it won't uh stick out much. Yeah okay. Well, maybe we can just open images there, and I'll paint and paint. I'll be able to do a better job. Bu Yeah, I agree more like iPod. Yes. Just a Speech. Yeah, do we s keep that? Yeah, I think Well uh then it w Well that's very easy. We already have uh the beeping of the home station, so Uh strange that I received the information about that. So shall we it open then? So we can put all the Okay. Yeah. Oh yeah, I No. I just I just received the Yeah. Yeah, our division has developed a new speech recognition feature, the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit. This is a very small electronic unit, will give a standard answer after it recognise a question. Doesn't say. Just You say record, followed by your question sample, and after a few seconds the answer uh sample. Because uh So it works like uh good morning remote control, and then the remote control says good morning. Yeah uh th that's just It's a No. Yeah, it Well that's integrated in the chip, so if you use the speech recognition, that's in it. I dunno, but if we use speech recognition, that will be in it as well. Well it it would be would be a good feature feature. Okay. No no worries about the cost, etcetera. And there's a chip in it that will Okay.
