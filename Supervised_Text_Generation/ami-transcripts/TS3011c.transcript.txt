Bongiorno. Punish. You wish. Welcome. Uh Yeah. No. Alright. But they like dark colours, you said in the p Okay. Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow. I had Or we could make oh. Yeah, o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens. The yellow uh rubber telephone. It's the it's the rubber uh cover. And it's uh colourful. It looks likes a banana. We have the fruit, we have the colours. We have the simple design. Um thirty five. And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, I don't ha really have much to add, um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion. Um Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume. Well, a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these. These are both with uh with voice recognition, but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um, well, a weird um shape. So I suggest I couldn't uh I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper. But it didn't work. My pen didn't load um the information. So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint. But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control. Uh yellow. But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone, it's rubber. So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed. Yeah. Great. Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information, in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh, well, the the fancy colours and uh and so on, and still have the ease of use, because we have an easy interface. And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on. Yeah. So if you have the voice recognition, you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it. Yeah. Right. Great. Like the watch. But if you're watching a movie, how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch, you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also. You you walk and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh, we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round. But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too. I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels. I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it. Yeah. Yeah, uh that's a possibility, but But Flores, think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for A volume, okay. Yeah. Wheel. Yeah, I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said, um the grip uh places in in the remote control. You have your hand on one place on the remote control, so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb. So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect. Yeah yeah, you can um I have some information about it. Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up. Of mute, let's say mute. Um you programme it, you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function and uh when you speak in the the remote control, it repeats uh your saying. So that's the sample sensor. So if you say mute, it says mute again, and then it's um well, I believe it's uh Yeah, and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is. So you say mute, he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute, and then goes to the mute function. Yeah. Well, I don't have um I haven't looked for uh for information about it, but I don't think information uh y I don't think you need it on a display. Especially when when we have to look at a cost, I don't think uh 'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen, yeah. But what about um the markets uh wants colourfuls uh designs? So if you use titanium Okay. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Yeah. And I would think And they can be implemented with a regular chip? Okay, but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker oh, evalu But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all. Well, if you if you take your hand before it, okay, it won't work, but you can point it just to the other wall. Yeah. And the regular chip. And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels. Yeah. No. Think so too. But we already have the scroll-wheels, the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition, the rubber, the fancy colours. Um no. Nothing more. Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case? Yeah, okay. Sorry, yeah. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Yeah. The project drawing is for the next Yeah, right. Single-curved. But can there be uh wor can they work together? Or do we have to choose between them? 'Cause if we have to choose yeah? Okay. What if not? Okay. Yeah. Grey and yellow. Yellow case and grey buttons, I think. I believe the But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button. And um Well well Well, there is. Just a week ago, a keyboard manufacturer would print, with and uh No. A scroll-wheel. Voice recognition, of course. What what did you say? Yeah. Yeah, or you could use plastic buttons. In the rubber. Yeah, b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually. What I said in the in the first uh discussion, uh the digit six on the button, it will disappear when it's from rubber. It is not uh something uh it's no information I read about it or so, but it's just from No, but but uh it Yeah, b yeah. Yeah, that's possible, but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case. So still then, if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control, you just rub on the cover, so you rub on the painting. Yeah. Yeah, but but the the plus or the minus. You have to draw the Yeah, it's on the cover. So if you uh You just move the problem. Y uh can you separate these uh these I do. Or the s uh the sideways. Or the the back. Or the back. I think Yes, especially when there are l a few buttons on it, you have uh a lot of space to touch. So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it. Yeah. Yeah. Regular. Use with.. For the finishing touch. Uh yeah. But um Sebastian has everything.
Hello hello Mister P_M_. Well, that's where the thinking goes on. I think you should punish him. You're the P_M_. Possibilities, yeah? Yes. So Not at all. Okay. Just press the okay button, it works. How surprising. Oh wait uh wait up. Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also? Not something dull. Okay. But can you can you go back to that slide? The uh just one slide back, no no no. Yes. Okay, and the feel of the material has to be spongy. Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also, do you think? Okay. It's quite interesting. Yes. I don't know the phone, but I can imagine it. Oh, that one, yes. Now I kn uh oh, I know, I know. Yes, I I've seen it. I've seen it. So So ease of use is important, but technology is twice as important. And what was even more important? Okay. So that's the most important thing for our customers. Mm-hmm. But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic, so that's very good. Yes. Slippery. You have to grab it. Yes. There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in, so you can get a really good grip on it. So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it. It's it's a lot easier. So m Yes. But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation. Okay, but I'll I'll go into that, because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities. Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division, and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design. Uh these are the things we've looked at. And of course I used the web to uh find my information. About the casing, we have three different casing possibilities. We have the uncurved or flat case. Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box. I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing. We have uh a curved one. It's uh curved in two dimensions. You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form. So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape. Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape, which is curved in three dimension. I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation. The the big remote control, something like that. But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think. Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing. We can use plastic, which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice, but you can give it any colour, uh which is the same for rubber, but it's not slippery. We can use wood and titanium. Well, um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases. And these latex cases, there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source. Which brings me to the different energy sources. Um well, we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls. You really have to imagine like winding up your uh I d It would be very new, but it's a kind of a retro uh style, I think. Uh Well, this is quite interesting. Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply. So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall, whatever you wish. It have it it has to move, that's the the sense of it. And you can store the energy in the in the thing. Mm-hmm. It's very funny indeed. Mm-hmm. Indeed. Mm-hmm. Yes. But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy. the the shaking of your body, which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake, uh it charges it. But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy. So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time, and you want t to switch uh the channel or something, well, m it might not work. So that's something you have to keep in mind. So, but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries, so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy, use the kinetic energy, and otherwise use the batteries. Uh yes, it does. I'll come to that later. And we of course have the traditional uh solar power, which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity. The user interface controls, um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels. And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons. So it's just like a mouse. You can scroll 'em, you can also push it. Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays, which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently uh and we also have double scroll-buttons, which are just two of these things. So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting, the the thing with the the round with the four Yes. That is possible too. Yes. Mm-hmm. Well, mayb uh well, m me neither. Maybe when you integrate some functions. Uh it's do it's done before. Yes. It's quite quite good, yes. Well, it's it well, i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel. There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel. You just use the wheel. About mute. Well, yes. Okay. Yes. Well, okay. Well, that that that's one possibility, okay. Well, okay. It's quite goods. Mm-hmm. Yes. Hmm. But it's done before, uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio, pocket radios. We use this. And Well, it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now. So maybe it's not no. Hmm. Yes, but it uses two separate buttons. It doesn't use a. Well. Uh something for uh Roo here. Wi within reach. Yes, you have to. Yes. yes. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay, um we have to know, if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case, um you must use these push uh push-buttons. There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays. There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels, because it's all curved. There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things. So that's a limitation. About um the components, uh just the hardware. We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal. Uh we have a simple, regular and advanced chip. And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker, which is a little cryptic uh to me. But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So so okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay, so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for. Okay. This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip, I thought. Um no op I'm not very sure. No, it's not in here. If we want to use the L_C_D_ display, we really need the advanced version, which is a bit l little bit more costly. If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version. And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip, which is a bit cheaper. Okay. Um no, but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about. I I don't think either. No. I don't think you need it. Okay. Okay, well my conclusion, um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought. I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing, but they seem to like natural uh stuff. So maybe we should think about uh wood finish. Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy. It's more reliable, it's cheaper. So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing. The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility. It's it's more advanced, but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries. Otherwise it will not too advanced, uh well. It's in in in some way it can give us an advance, because you will save on your batteries. But Yes. And I think it's more robust. It's more uh Uh it's more functional. The titanium thing uh we have to skip it. So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff, and we should uh use wood or something like that. Oh okay, sorry. So it it needs to be rubber. Okay. Okay, spongy materials. Okay, um well um these scroll-wheels, I think uh they they can be they can be handy. So Yes, they can. But they really need the regular chip, you cannot use the sa simple Well, I'm not very sure. Maybe that's an uh a different I think so, if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design, i uh it's too dull. I don't think c our customers will like it. And um if you uh take the double-curved, uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels. So I think this is the best of two worlds. Yes. It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device. It's very unlogical. Well the there has to be some pointing at. But All lights get absorbed, yeah. Yes, because the walls they they reflect the infrared light. So it has an it's easier. Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample. Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker. Um with a with a regular chip. I think uh it gives us the advantage of Yes, yes. And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part. I don't think it it's any uh value added thing. So Okay. Technology. Yes. It's not very flashy and new. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Uh I think our customers will go insane. It's it's too much. Okay. Uh the n the next phase will be um the um not the what is the next phase f Flores? Okay. So i Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Yes, they can work. They cannot work with double-curved. That's that's problem. I'll check it for you. Yes. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you will be on the Bahamas. Uh Okay. So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made? I'll do. Okay. W start with the casing. Okay, single-curved case. Okay. What about the energy source? I I think they can. Yes. Well, uh It it should be. There should be really no problem. They can be supplementary. That's no problem. So So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar. Okay. What about uh the finishing of the case? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber? Okay, and I think we should use the company colours. Something like black and red. uh black and yellow. Grey yellow, okay. Oh, I think it's uh it's not very dull. It's quite modern actually. Don't you think? Hmm. Okay. Okay, but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device. Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself. But Oh, I've read. Yes. Yes, but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques. They're actually very slow in its techniques. So So I'm afraid it's not possible. Okay, so scroll-wheel. But there will be some additional buttons, I guess. And th the they should be spongy also, because they're they're rubber too. Well uh you can use well, when you use the buttons, they'll they'll be made of rubber too. So it has th the spongy uh feel also. So I I think that's okay. Yes. That's okay. Yes, the signs. Uh I see what you mean. Well, maybe that's possible, because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing. So maybe they can combine these two. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, I'm I'm not so sure, I think it c should be Well, I'm not sure, I have to ask with manufacturing, but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want, because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel, and that's what you get with rubber. So if you want the spongy feel, you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber. I think both. I do. I think Okay. Um not quite. Um what about uh the chips? We use the regular chip? Okay. And Well no, I think that's about it. Yes. The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_. That's all. And we've decided not to use L_C_D_. So Okay. Okay. I'll put it online.
Um Mm, don't think so. Unless uh things have suddenly change again. Uh don't know. Maybe uh you've got new information, like uh last time. Okay. Oop. No. 'Kay. Hmm? Oh.. Yeah, Okay. Yeah. Yeah. My method? Well, findings. Uh Ease of use is important, but uh innovation is more important, and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important. And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes, shoes and furniture, and that they want spongy material. Probably watch too much Sponge Bob. Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours. Simple shapes uh m material. But we since we are concentrating on uh the younger group 'Kay. Well, uh one example given was this, so um I assume they just want something colourful. Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something. No, uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects. But Which one? This? Yes. Uh well, it might. But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control. But Maybe soft material or something. But not a real sponge. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and like uh the older group likes familiar materials, but that doesn't mean we should use wood, So Well, this this is an example of what they would like. But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group, I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones, exch exchangeable covers. So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like. I've seen it, but 'Kay. Uh that's about it. Yes. Uh soft material. Uh the fancy look and feel. Yes. Apparently. Yeah. Um Uh well, it's obvious obviously new. So it might attract uh the young customers. Hmm. And yeah, the yeah, the older people liked wood. No the Yeah, the younger people liked soft material. Yeah. Yeah. Standard? Nah, um n no, I don't think so. M Hmm. Or black and yellow. Yeah. Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition? 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button. There the icons. So you don't touch the icons that much.
Do you need to change anything on it? Because otherwise I will already open it. Okay. Is it much changes? Uh I didn't No no. I do hot have Only the same information. Hello, Sebastian. I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well, in the control room. Oh, it's that Roo again, always late. Bongiorno. Hmm. I see some interesting okay. People, welcome back. The third meeting. Um I have some points I would like to uh some some issues I would like to point out. Um first of all, um if you make minutes yourself as well, uh like Sebastian does, um could you put them on the shared folder? If you do not make minutes, no problem, but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down, so I could uh can uh um use that in the in the report. Um the second thing, um I was th uh s thinking to myself, I have this little remote control, and I'm talking to it, but I still need to point to the television, because it works with infrared. That's quite strange. Okay. We'll come to that later, I g I think. Um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions? Okay. Um we wi we will have your individual presentations, uh then the decision on the remote control concept, um and uh the closing. Forty minutes in total for this. So um I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations, um the progress you've made. Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first, because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation. Um yeah. Uh w wait a sec wait a se uh could you go to the previous slide? Um because I'm taking minutes and it Um were the important themes enclose. Yeah okay. The feel of to be spongy Okay, so so, yeah, it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard. It it maybe it rubber or or yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, that's interesting. You could make a few v very colourful ones, and uh a very traditional co cover. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it is, it is i yeah. Yeah. Do you know the phone? It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five, I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away, the very You kn you know, Ruud, as well? About th Okay. Okay. Um uh okay. Do you have uh thit that was Okay. Okay, so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group. And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials. Okay. Okay, Roo, could you do your presentation? Okay, well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about. Shape. Yeah. And what I'm thinking about, maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control. Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt, too slippery, s because um Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah, ex for your fingers, yeah. Yeah. It grips automatically. Yeah, okay. Okay, good. Yeah. Way too much I think for our goal, yeah. Okay, b but I think we'll yeah. Okay. Well, it would be very new to the market, but Yeah. I think um, if if I can hook on to that, um the kinetic thing is very funny. I mean solar is of course it's nice, but it's, well, your uh your calculator has a solar panel. Um hand dynamo Well, maybe m Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah. And wha Okay. Yeah. Okay, because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power. Yeah. Okay. Well This will be the remote, right? Um with uh maybe a channel selector. What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side? Because this is how you keep it Volume? Well, what about mute? Thi i i m I guess uh th this is my volume button. And I can either on this side or this side um And click it to muten the device. And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market. So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones. So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about. Uh Ruud, wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar? Uh scroll-wheel. Okay. Yeah. Well, all the Sony telephones use it, for example, for volume. Nokia has a well, okay, it's not really a scroll-wheel, but on their side th the the volume button is on the side, because you gri grab it like this. Yeah. I know, it's not really a scroll-wheel. No. Yeah. For you too, yeah. Okay. Sebastian. Um Yeah. It performs the action. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh well uh d did we already decide on the display? To No. On screen display. Yeah. Okay th Okay. Good. Kineti okay. Okay, it's maybe a bit too too flashy, too yeah. Yeah, but that that's the same with the solar cell. That's no different. Yeah. Okay. No no, but the uh um that's what Sebastian said. He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference. But but yet, I understood that the market is different. So um No, r rubber with colours. Colourful and Yeah. But but do we want the curved uh uh design, or I it's too dull. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue. Because it it's of cour Yeah. Well It depends also on your on your Well, it depends on your walls actually. If you have uh have um smooth walls, it it it probably you're probably right. But if you have carpets on the wall, which our natural loving friends probably do have, then um yeah, th th it might be a bit more of a issue. So Yeah. I like the scroll wheels uh idea. Yeah. Well, it looks uh yeah, well um according to Ruud, the the the market likes um new flashy technology, and I mean L_C_D_ is well, ok I know, but it's m it's less um s standard than than Well, we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part. That's the problem. Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance, I would say do integrate it, because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it. Mm yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah. Okay, I I agree. I think i Ruud, do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or No? Sebast uh nee, Roo? Roo, do you have any other Nothing more. Um Sebas Well, we we need to describe uh decisions now. So um on the energy, well, we decided. Chip. The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve. User interface um Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product. I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian. Uh you talked about it before, the colours, grey and yellow. Keep it in mind. And um the buttons, well we talked about it now. The next phase, um Sebastian, um is um the design of the look and feel. The user interface design. And for you, the product evaluation. Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that. Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard. And I'm going uh to plan my holidays. Yeah, it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes, uh you will have a uh prototype ready. Yeah? I can. Um maybe one of you could write it down. Great. Um Uh you you need to help me. Um The casing is curved, single-curved. Traditional batteries uh and solar. No, they can be complementary. Uh al al I uh Every device Yeah. Okay, um th Battery and solar, yeah. Yeah, with colourful rubber. Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers, but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish. Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow. Yeah. Yeah, although I don't think that's very colourful. Except for the yellow of course, but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours. Well, I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before. Well, it it doesn't have to be red. Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for. Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours, it should be a full colour cover with such an image or or I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group, I guess. Black and yellow, yeah. Okay, so we have to deal with wh what's possible here. Yeah. Okay. Um more f more more decisions we made. Um Um The scroll-heel. Yes, the voice recognition we already decided. Yeah. Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two. Yeah. I think rubber is nice. Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button, and what do they want spongy uh uh devices, or or i. Uh is that uh does our our supplier say so? Yeah. You could place a um uh this this would be the button. The scroll-wheel, I mean. And you could place the indica th th the signals the No no, there's no painting, only uh yellow or But it's into the rubber. Yeah, but this is on the pla yeah, I know. Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean. What about um making this rubber and making this plastic? Yeah. Well actually, we should have it the other way around, I guess. A plastic cover with rubber finishing. I mean, this is this is the finishing. This is um what's on the edge. What you feel. But the front, on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber. I mean I know, but do you touch this or do you touch this? I mean, I I never touch between the buttons. Yeah, the side, exactly, the sideways. The side, but do you touch between the the these buttons? Okay. Well, we do not have very much time uh left. Um I guess you two have to figure that out. I'm going to leave the decision to you, um because you have to make its prototype, and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers, the possibilities and uh so I'm going to leave it the decision with you. Um Sebastian, did you write enough decisions down? Yeah. Okay. With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions. The chip is is not really Okay, well. Yeah. Okay. Um okay, then I think we are uh quite finished. Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um Yeah? Yeah, um if you write wrote anything down, uh could you put it on the shared folder? Yeah. I know, but well Great. Right.
