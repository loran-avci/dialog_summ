Hi. Oh yeah, we have to talk in English, huh. I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh. I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow. I don't know how much preparation you guys did, but not a lot. Mm-hmm. Not yet. Operations. Different pen widths, how do you do that? Oh okay. Are you serious? I in the file option menu. How much time do we have to draw anyway? 'Cause I can take forever on this. Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other? Alright. Uh. Your line broke. I'm guessing a turtle. No. I'm kidding. Because of its shell. Dude you're a good drawer. Do you have a turtle pet? Uh okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Stumpy stuff. They kind of l look like mole legs. With sharp nails on. A little tail maybe. Uh no. The little holes maybe. And why did you choose this animal? Alright. Alright. Colours were under format right? Let's see. How am I gonna do this? Um Mm uh. Not quite actually. No. Aye. It's a cat. Not quite yet through. Uh yeah I dunno. They're my favourite pets. Uh I have colour already. Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of st Oh shit. Um Excuse my language. I don't know how to draw its face. But you get the idea. It's a cat. It's my favourite uh pet animal, 'cause they're cute, they're independent and cuddly, I dunno. That's it. Or do I need to use more colours and Alright. Yeah. So we have to s Yeah. Mm-hmm. I guess so. Yeah. True. Well I started making an overview for myself, um what I had to do, 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever. So I had to uh, I dunno, make an overview for myself about what I have to do, and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it. Well I started I started with the first phase, I think was the functional. And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design, which you said. How does the apparatus work? And well I basically had two points. Uh according to the coffee uh machine example, I have batteries to supply energy, and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_. And that's basically all I have so far. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions, 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that. I mean, you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also. I dunno what the word is in English. Uh Yeah. Obviously. Whoa. Is that you or alright. Alright. Alright. Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session? Yeah okay. We'll do our best. I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in. Do we I mean, is it gonna be a multimedia control centre? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it? Yeah. True. But but we need good communication about this stuff, 'cause I have to f put the components into the design. So if I don't know what components to put in, it's kind of hard. Yeah so Okay. Yeah I I know what you mean, but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function. And you you don't need that for a T_V_. And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well, so I kind of need to know what we uh need. Whatever, I'll just put my ideas in uh in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting. Okay. Okay. Alright. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Thanks. Alright. See you later. What the
We're the first. Marketing Expert, yes. Yes. Bling bling. Yeah. Right. Uh where has my screen gone? Hmm. Yeah. My screen is gone. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Very nice. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Draw. Alright. 'Kay. Don't take up too much space. Should it be one Giraffe's yellow. Can you use one blank sheet per drawing? Or so y you must save it at the end and then Okay, then m make a new one. It's more like a dinosaur. Uh. Some leaf to eat. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Uh Yeah. Alright. It's not that fast. Yeah. I see. It misses the spot. I say good guess. Uh Because it's slow. Yeah I was a bit slow too. So Uh some other line uh width uh No. I dunno. Does it have legs? Yeah? It's more like a tank. Yeah that's fins but I don't know where. Some spots. Ah some eye. Yeah that's a fr friendly turtle I guess. Yeah well I think it's uh fair enough. Right. I don't know what the position is. Does it have ears? No. Oh okay. Can you erase ears or Yeah? Alright. Eraser. So I dunno. I it just came into my mind. So there's no particular reason I pen. Yeah. Well I'm guess I'm done. That's my turtle. How to select the next or here. Yeah. Here you go. A fox yeah. Firefox. A cat who had an accident or Yeah. Okay. Great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's very common. Yeah. Yeah. Uh well from a marketing uh perspective, um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements. Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market. I mean, what functions do they have. Um especially what are their shortcomings? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product? Um therefore we have to to do some internet search. For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support, and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions? So we can see uh what needs to be supported. Um and we can interview current users and future users. What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control? Um especially for future users, uh I'm thinking of early adopters, because they they use new technology first, and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add. I think I can get that information, yeah. So yeah. No n not specifically. More to how to get them and Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. From the other end of the room or something? Yeah. Any more points to discuss? Alright. 'Kay. Thanks. Yeah. The pro okay. Yeah. Okay. Uh. I guess so. Yeah. We're just working the three phases. Okay. Better make it Yeah. That is my question also because like new new functions Requirements. Yeah. Yeah. Unit. Yeah. Yeah well I I was Yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there, which I know, there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices. So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video. And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre, because that's getting very popular. And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control. So with the switch, one single switch S Yeah records and stuff like that. No. Yeah. Yeah. In the project uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Half an hour. You're fired. No. Alright let's move on. Yeah. Yeah see you later. Well good luck.
Mm uh. Mm. We're the first ones. Move to the meeting room. Okay. Hello, good day. Yep. Kick-off meeting, wow. It's uh looks uh nice. Hmm? Yeah. No, it's it was uh not enough. I did my best. Okay. Um yeah. It's a giraffe. Yeah. Okay. Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh Oh format. That's some spots. No. Okay. Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal? I think it's a it's a great animal. It's a it's a giraffe. Yeah, that's a Um Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye. Hey. Come on. The next? Yes. Here you go. Hmm. 'Cause it's so 'cause it's green. No. A rabbit I think. Kangaroo. Fox. Mm. Okay. What uh what uh do you want to discuss? Yep. Yep. Yeah. Wireless uh huh. Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function. You d you already told that. And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume. That are the the basic options for a remote control. Okay, yeah. Yeah. Yep. I got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user-friendly. Uh really easy to use buttons, not not uh very small buttons, but not the the also the big big buttons, but just normal buttons. It has to be a small unit. It has to be uh yeah, you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house. So it has n has not to be l yeah, gigantic uh machine. Uh and a and a good uh zapping range. Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be, uh yeah um yeah, quite a big distance. It has to be capable for zapping uh Yeah. Okay. Are you going to put the the notes on the Okay. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Do we only have to to do uh phase one, the functional design uh? After that we are going to the conceptual uh Okay. I would first m Yeah. I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly. So it's hasn't it's yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Can we leave now or Mm. Okay. Good luck.
Mm. So you found your spots. Okay. It's called black. Okay. You see this beautiful presentation. Okay let's get started. Uh I sort of prepared this. Uh opening acquaintance, tool training, uh how to use the things here. Uh project plan discussion, and yeah then the rest of the meeting. Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control, that's both original, trendy and user-friendly. So, hope you have good ideas. I don't. Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom. Uh functional design, then we do some in individual work, then we have a meeting to discuss the results, etcetera etcetera. And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up. Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard. Um uh we should take some practice. I have some instructions now to do that. Uh well you know how to the documents work. So Uh this for toolbar. You see it next. Um we have a pen. And we can use this pen to perform. Yes. So It doesn't always work. Yes. Okay so you can draw. Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width, etcetera etcetera. Okay? Uh Okay. Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal. Uh you should explain Uh with different colours and with different pen widths. And you should explain why you draw that particular animal. So, Julian. Uh with the format menu. And use different colours etcetera. And what's that supposed to be? Oh yeah. Oh yeah four legs. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah you can press the next button, which is uh yeah. I'll show you. Yeah. In file menu. Yeah. Yeah. What is it? A giraffe okay. Yeah I see a long neck but Okay. That's nice of you. Okay. Yeah pretty good. Uh could you press the next uh Okay. Then uh. Yeah sorry, introduction and get acquainted and That's the idea, so Yeah it's a bit slow, so Yeah. pressure. Why a turtle? It's slow. You were slow too so Yeah sure. Yeah not exactly legs but More like fins or Yeah. Yeah it's l looks very friendly. Yeah okay. No. Yeah yeah yeah. There's a a gum, gum to. He said it was slow. I like it. Okay. Your turn Niels. The next yeah. Makes new paper. Yeah. Orange. Kangaroo. Dog. Cat. It's a cat. Why a cat? You have some uh? The pen, yeah. Sure. Yeah. Alright. Okay. Yeah. I think it's okay. You get idea right? Okay um we have a financial aspect to this project. Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros. Uh the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros. Uh that's quite a big amount of money. And the production cost should be the half of the selling price. Okay now it's time for some discussion. Uh Yeah. We should get started. Uh I'm taking notes. Um we each have a specific task, as I saw in my mail. I didn't know if you received the same mail. Yeah? Okay so the um uh this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design. Am I correct? Okay. Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions. Right? Yeah? And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements. Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah I got another point. It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo. Same I believe. Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yes. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. And you can get that information? Okay. That would be very handy. Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are? No? No okay. Yeah? Of course. Big, mm-hmm. Uh what do you mean by that? Okay um Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment. Um I think the best is to go to work. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I think we can go ahead with what we have. I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder. Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design, etcetera etcetera. And it seems you get more information by email. So that was it for me. Uh Yeah, in the project folder. Yeah. I'm writing very fast. Hope it's readable. Okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion? Yeah. Because then we have a Yeah. Y you do some individual work, we have meeting, individual work, meeting. And at the end of the day we have a final meeting. And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design, so make it good. I depend on you. Yeah? If you can mix it it's okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think that is the user requirements part. As to what they want. Uh do they want all those functions on that small Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah I understand. You can always add a few Yeah. Hmm, the C_D_ player. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. You need additional yeah. Yeah. Uh Yeah. Yeah. We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video. And um reserve the possibility to add other features. So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible. Yeah. Th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera. Yeah? Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to. Yeah, you're di dismissed. Not yet. Okay. Let's see what we got to do. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
