Mm. So, uh now it's the Hi Sammy. It's the detail design meeting, so we're going last meeting. So um, first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype. Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype. Then, w we And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team. And that's all. Okay. So first, let's uh see the prototype. Okay. And you have some slides then? Yeah. Mm. Okay. Uh so in which uh Mm okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. MASA? Okay. What do you say? One day. He Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Bobby. Mm-hmm. Hmm. 'Kay. Are colourful. Yeah. Ho-ho. That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium? Mm-mm. Hey, you know you're theme today. Hmm. And w wait, wh what are the strawberries for? Wh wh Mm-hmm. Okay. Strawberries. Ah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into W Who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in? Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh, so Let's uh, yeah, let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium. Oops. Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh, I think that fancy, we can say it is fancy. Oh. I am not the d the only one choosing, yeah. Uh what do you think? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. It's in the other. Yeah. Mm. Two. Let's say two, yeah. Change colour of t Yeah, I think it's a Yeah. Yeah. Mm-mm. Um The strawberries Oh. Mm-mm. Yeah. But it's too. It's um robust, yeah. Oh, yeah, lets me try. Yeah. What is uh next, please? And you can uh do di two sites? Yeah. Okay, also. You can, by using the You c push here the the yeah. Let me understand well, because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button. Yeah, two Yeah. Yeah. And which what is that? Okay, okay. It's a kind Oh, okay okay. Oh oh okay, great. Now it's looks us useful. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-mm. Uh-oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's. Let's imagine. And what about the strawberries on the top? I'm not convince. But maybe I'm not trendy. But, uh Yeah, but uh uh they're not useful. I I mean it that's uh Mm-hmm. Yep. Hmm. I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But the n Yeah. Mm. No, I'm not sure uh why uh if it was like this I It's n no, it's not fancy any more. Okay. Uh-huh. And different routes. Okay, I see what Okay, so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control. Also. Okay. Okay. Okay. Wow, that's a Yea Yeah, it's fudge titanium. You know. Right, yeah. And uh Okay. Let's go for one. Yeah. So it's a good evaluation. Yeah. Mm. Mm-mm. Okay. So now, it has to fulfil the financial criterium? So, I have an Here. Um. Okay, so two. Uh-huh. Oh. Yeah yeah, but the price is two. Oh, number. Sorry sorry sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. No, never. H Okay. And for the One also. I thought you can curve somebody. Mm-hmm. Oh see, I I think that the the price is this one. Yeah, yeah. Don't chip on me. Mm-hmm. Mm-mm. Yeah. But she wanted u the fudge titanium. I think it's five, but you don't say. Mm. Oh, sorry. Again, I'm See it. Special colour, or it's only on the Yeah, but there is no colour here. So I put it here. How many push-button? Three or two? Is there The scroll-wheel, okay. Okay. Um That's that's not We choose this one, and not this one. Or only a scroll-wheel. You try to s No, no, no. Because how do you do to y select? Yeah, I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you Stay longer. Okay. Oops. Okay, okay. Um Mm-hmm. You you have all of these, no? Mm maybe n not this one but Yeah, so Not special colours an interest in? And buttons are not colourised? They are m Boo-hoo. It's already too expensive. Apparently. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. So think of what we can cut uh here. Apparently, we have to choose one or the other. But you don't need a battery? Mm. But um it's like the hand dynamo, no? Uh it's a it's a beginning. Okay. So One here and here. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm. That's right. M maybe minus uh three, no? Mm-hmm. Mm. So Oh, sorry. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Oh, we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want. Oh. Both its it's cool. Mm. Yeah, yeah y Yeah. Mm. It's maximum and don't have to Yeah, yeah. Uh Uh, mm-mm. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Mm. So target reached. It's um English uh Yeah. Yeah, but uh is uh English. So Mm. Mm, let's try. Okay. I save it uh Okay, so next mm No, that's yours. Sorry. 'Kay. Okay. So now We have to make um Yeah. Yeah. Mm. See mm how Are we a good team? Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Is there enough room for creativity? Mm. And you. Mm. Oh. Okay. Well, project evaluation. So, you say, is there sheep? Luck. Okay. So luck, but good. Which imply good uh team performance. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Okay. A lot of uh Yeah, uh new ways of doing financial Mm. Mm. They're working on um pink titanium. Mm yeah. Yeah, we're really nice. Yeah. Mm. Okay. I think it's Yeah. Uh How Yeah. Mm. I'm the one, proposing the celebration. Of course, you know I'm the program manager. Mm-hmm. Ah um, I think it's finish. Yeah. Mm. Mm-mm. And we go to the party. thank you to you. Mm.
So, Hi Christa. Yes. Mm.. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Such a nice thing. Can I? Ho-ho. It says I will uh I'll buy it. If I if I need so. Hopefully my daughter will like it. Yes, of course. Of c course. Ah. Oh, there is a button missing. Okay. It's in option. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hey, babe. Bob. Hey Bob. Okay, that's good. Oh, these are strawberries. Fruit smelling spongy titanium. I didn't know it exist, but that's great. Ha. You mean we can change the colour uh of th Yeah. Yeah okay, for the L_C_D_. Tit titanium is Uh, okay. Yeah, Bob, please. Tuesday colour. Okay. Mm-hmm. Black for Sunday. On the L_C_D_? Oh. Of course. What do you think? Strawberry sensors. Very useful. Lounge meeting. Alright. Good. So, huh. Interesting. In interesting. Mm mm. It makes sense. So uh, this is What a design. It's my turn. Mm-hmm. Let's see if this Yeah, if you meet the evaluation criterion. Yeah. So, evaluation please. So. You made a very nice prototype, and um, I think, we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it, if it fulfils our what we want to do, and things like that. So mm Uh, next slide, please. As you know, before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control, it's very important to first verify if it makes sense, if we have a chance to sell it. Uh, so we need to evaluate it um, try to do it in a constative way, and as much as we can. To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven. One meaning that, ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion, whatever it is. And seven meaning, no it doesn't fulfil at all. And we're all l going to list all the criterion. I'm going to go to that next slide, and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven. And then we are just going to have an average, which will give us the value of our uh remote control. So, maybe we can have a look at the criteria? So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important. Of course, this can be discussed, but let's let's see, so let's vote. So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle. So, what do you think, is it fancy? It is very very fancy. Or have you ever seen something like that? Yeah, of course. What do you think? Is it The weight is later. Now we're We're on the fanciness now. I think it's quite fancy. It's uh Yeah, so No it's it's one. Yeah, o one means it's, yes, a very fancy and seven mean no at all. So it's one or two. What do you think? Two? Okay. So here, two. Up. Then we have uh technology. So, what about technology? We have uh we have speech recognition, we have location based, we have L_C_D_. Change colour, I mean that's very Quite d I think it's a one for that, at least. At least a one, yeah. Robustness, uh-huh. So let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away. Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again? Uh, maybe not the prototype. Let's try. Oh my god. Okay, we just lost one strawberry. So Not at all? It is Yeah. Yeah. So it's not so bad. I um uh I would say three. Yeah, that does make sense, yeah? Useful. Well, so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control? So I don't know. These buttons are uh It not clear. But you have at least uh next produce. Uh, it depends on the Okay. So but, for instance, because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control, touch screen, you cannot go to channel twenty five directly. Directly. Yeah. Oh, it's a jog dial, okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah. Okay. It's much longer than that that being two two five, no? Don't you think so? May not okay, we can go. That's uh You're right. That's it's less uh Yeah. But it's it's nice, because people anyway don't go there. But So what do you think for it, usefulness? Seems to be useful. Both. Yeah. Yeah. Up down or left right. Yeah. That Cool. I would say then uh Two or three? Two or three? Two. Okay, two. So size and weight. Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size, real weight? Or Because it Size is going to be that, yeah? Uh, and and It's going to be lighter, because this seems to be very heavy f I mean, for my daughter, for instance. Not sure if uh she can use it. So, should be okay. Up to three for that, because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh Colour and shape. Well, so colour, it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_. But um, it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case. It's a it's going to be titanium. Okay, okay. That's nice. I think it's good. Okay. Yahoo. Well y you know, it's this uh fruit and vegetable year. So Uh, I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness. Whether it's fancy or not now, it we have to decide. But this If it's Uh-huh. So, that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead.. So, it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh I suggested three. Because uh, everybody s doesn't seem to be convince, although it's quite You have good arguments. But And uh the last one is adaptive. This is not r maybe not as important as the other one, but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use? Great. Fully adaptable. That's Yeah. So you can fit into your palm, okay. That What else can we need? You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well? It's fudge, yeah, yeah. Yeah, fruit titanium, yeah. Well, I if if this is if you are ready to do that, then I think it deserves a one. Okay. Now we have to do the average. Who is good in math? Okay. Two point one seven. That's nice. Two point one seven out of seven. I think we have a good good thing. Well, that's all I had to say about the evaluation. So It seems to be good, yeah. We have uh Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Ah-ha. So so how many batteries do we need? One battery? Good. Why two? Say no. No, ne never install. Two batteries or one? Only one. No, no. But no, no. No, no way. Yeah. You never use uh Excel? Good. It's twelve bucks. Twelve bucks. Twelve and a half, I think. Okay. Okay, electronics. So It's a simple chip? Simple chip, okay. One. Okay. One or two? One? Okay. So the case, which one uh is it in the end? Let's do a single curve. It's flat, and curved. It's curvable. Maybe there is a supplement for that, no? It's only curve? Okay, let's go. This Okay, you d We tried, we tried. So, what is it? T titanium? Mm, that's expensive. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's stick to s titan. Special colour? No because uh Yeah. Oh. So the L_C_D_ Two. Yeah. It's going to be expensive. That's all? No. Oh, I think, no it's Uh, is it a scroll wheel and pe push button, th this centre one? Or only only scroll wheel, okay. You are trying to make make up make us up. No, but you select with the two d the other two buttons, no? That's true. Yeah. Yeah. It should stay. Yeah. She's very hard on this. Special colour? Yeah. No. Special material? Yeah, buttons are the standard buttons. Yeah. It's only buttons, these. Nothing special. Okay. So we are at seventeen dot eight. No, the colour is in the L_C_D_. I no. We can just use this red. It's So what is Are we supposed to cut things out now? Uh, until we get twelve fifty. Well, if I look at what is the most expensive things, uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So that would So, but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay, we only We we win one. That's already that. Okay, let's do that. I'm not sure if this is legal. And? No. Okay, let's see. Yeah, yeah, yeah, if Click somewhere, you'll see features. Yes, it does. Maybe put minus two, so it looks uh more reasonable. Yeah, anyway No, minus two. Nobody will know. It's not recorded, is it? Okay, we're on time. Good. No, now we are exp exceeding I think. It Is it? I think we're exceeding now. We have to remove the Uh, it's better. I think they are counting uh We would prefer, yeah. Maximum is maximum. So, remove one of them. Yeah. Okay. Okay, we're uh on target. I'm just curious to see this uh my address chip on print. Trick. Uh, I would say it's the Russian trick, but Anyway No, they may have some their origins, strange origins No, no, no. Let's finish this meeting instead. What else? No. This is right. Okay, so finance, that's done. Are the cost under twelve? Yes. Project evaluation, good. Project process. Safe uh asse uh safe assessment. Yeah, I think we've listened to everybody. Everybody could say what they thought. And uh Yeah. When we see the results, there is no doubt there Maybe a lack of leadership? Team-work, very strong, I would say. Team-work, no problem. Means. Whiteboard, digital pens. Yeah, I think white-board is useful. Digital pens, useful. New ideas found? Yeah. But uh Yeah, but uh then I I mus That's true. And there's uh one very important point. We're on time. Meetings finish when they have to or even before. The for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing. Yeah. Yeah, we have other uh remote controls to create. Mm.. Mm, yeah. Hey, just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the pinkness of that uh. They are working on a Okay, good. I think we are great. There's no no other words for that. We are probably the best. Real Reaction is uh Yeah. Yeah. Finished? Ah, celebration. Are the costs within the budget? Of course they are. Yeah. Is the project evaluated? Yes, it is. To whom? To the whole our company? So, let's celebrate. Uh I think the meeting The meeting is over at least. So, we have to go out. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Uh, here we have our prototype model. Yeah. Yeah, we have also some slides. In Yeah. Five. Him.. Experience. Explanat See this. You can Spongy. Hmm. So Yeah. This this is really flexible. You can add your buttons. Yeah. So function, mm So, as we discussed, we have to switch on switch off whenever we want. And so, we have buttons and using L_C_D_, or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_, and then do on and off. Then you ha you'll have volume control. So, you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume. And we have some L_C_D_ controls. Like, m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_, or you don't want you can just use normal button. And we have speech recognition. Here you have microphone, and then it date records your voice, and then it try to recognise. And it can also do the action. And location finder. And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser. You can just say, where is my remote control. Or uh, you can just give some nickname to your remote control, like Bobby. And then, it will say hi. Yeah, hi, and then you can use it. So, um our team is now fruits. Mainly strawberry. So, you can have And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches. Material, we want to stick to titanium. We will send, we want to Yeah, or s So, we want to have simple and perfect shapes, like I shown in these phones. You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs. And you can choose colours on your day for each day, or even many colours. For the L_C_D_. With titanium it's it is silver. Yeah. Mm, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood, or s And you can have many colours on weekends. Or Huh? Ah, these are like sensors. So, after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for So, if you are vegetarian or you have any options, please let us know. Yeah. S So, any specific questions for Yeah. Yeah. Then we can discuss We can Yeah, then we can have how much for how money is left. Yeah. Fudge. Yeah. Fancy. Huh. Yeah, what's is really Uh, it's really Yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah. We can give at least five or six, seven. Oh, Oh. So Oh, okay. Yeah, okay. Oh, okay. So M maybe two. Technology. Yeah. Um And we have L_C_D_. So you change colours. Useful. Yeah, yeah. It's silly. Uh, still we need to cha Yeah, it Maybe strawberry. Oh. Yeah, we can easily plug it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Useful? Yeah, Yeah. Yeah, channel. I this is volume control and channel changes. These are the main You Yeah. Yeah, and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option. So if you don't want Yeah, um yeah. Yeah. And channel. You can select. Yeah mm. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah mm. So, d Yeah, we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_. So so Yeah. Yeah. Up. This is jog wheel. Yeah. Um, see in L_C_D_, like you will have blocks and you select which one. Yeah. Yeah. Two, maybe. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's size al almost Yeah, because it is The weight will be bit lighter. We will s We use titanium. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Heavy. Yeah. Yeah. But sides uh, the sides should be okay.. Yeah mm. Oh. Yeah. The case is silver titanium, no? Yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So maybe, I think Yeah. Yeah, well Yeah. Um Yeah, well then it's bit difficult to use. Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction, too. So, maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges, stuff for strawberries and different colours. So it's Even These buttons But it looks really not really good. I mean, the f Yeah. So these are kind of rubber things. Even if you lose one you can just put whatever. Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits, and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here, so we just Yeah, so even if you don't put, it works. But this is really fancy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Three, three, six, eight, eleven. Hmm.. Yeah mm. Yeah, two one one seven, we have. So Financi Energy. Uh, we use bat One battery. Yep. Oh, we just need one, I guess. No, number is one. We need only one battery. Number, number. So we We have sample chip. Uh, like simple chip, yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Four buttons at least. And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition. Yeah, one to one. Yeah, one. Yeah, I think we will go for a single curve, no? Oh, is Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah. Oh. Titanium. Yeah, well No, only one, no? Um Interface. Yes, in L_C_D_ display. Ok Yeah, an Yeah. Push-button. Scro Uh, two. Yeah. One scroll wheel. One L_C_D_ displayed. Yeah. Yeah, it's cheaper. Yeah. Only scroll wheel. Yeah mm. So It's already Ah. Y ye Yeah. Then it automatically we can just do like you feel, it goes. And it will activate Um, plus, yeah, it's price is really Special colours, yeah. Okay. Yeah, buttons and strawberries. Yeah. Special form. Uh, we have titan Yeah. Mm, hmm, I think uh because you can just go for a good colours. Yeah, and uh Yeah. Oh. Sample speaker. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand is Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just remo S Yeah. Uh, no. Yeah. No, no. It's not It's not changing, no? It you don't So now on, we can increase our Still you have two more. Maybe we can use it for our party. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that No, but point five point three. Okay. Is really strict? Oh. Oh yeah. Ho Oh. Uh And we can discuss all these things in our party. Mm yeah, very much. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's really Yeah. Yeah, our team-work is really strong. Oh, we still, I guess. Hmm. Don't really. Yeah. And we also Mm. We made Mm. Hmm. Ah, we got new idea, speech recognition, location finding. New materials, new s uh this fancy strawberry design. And new tricks. Ah, very. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's We got two Good score. Oh, okay. So where we will go now? Uh, ye Will go to Italian restaurant, or Ah, okay. We can decide. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
Yes. And chocolate? Mm-hmm. Yes, and place some slides. Uh, participant three. Prototype. Uh, so this is our remote control. It's a r working prototype. You can use it now by switching all these buttons. So first, I present as we came to this perfect model, and then we'll give some technical specifications. That's well, so that's that. Please, next slide. We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA, and uh made some real good Yeah. If you can see this, and the stars are showing that. And um, s society will accept that. For sure. And making some analysis of different fruits, we choose the ultimate form, ultimate colours, and uh ultimate smell of it. S please, next slide. But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea, 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the modern material we can p select. And it's practical. And it's still say it's for our needs, so please press something. And as I said, it's perfect. Please press it. Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an s such a r such a device. So you can touch it with your hands. Sure. Yes. N You must say it. Yeah. Okay. Y and we got the answer. Uh, it is, yes, of course., please next slide. Um, this is a prototype. You can have a look at it, and That's all I wanted to say. Now it's technical specification by our colleague. We are still working on titanium. So, r we'll start with L_C_D_. You can ask Bob. It's Tuesday. That's location sensors. Yeah, and we can just some strawberry first. Um Oops. Let's make a party first maybe. Feel the weight. Really. Okay. Two. Two. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Uh No. No. How can I say this. It's still it's still working, and your daughter got a bonus. A strawberry. You can. You go you So, the basic mode Yeah. So that's simple. The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial. With two buttons, you do this like uh volume up, volume down. Or if you go to the site, it's channel up channel down. And if you want to make to s twenty-five, you push on this. You select twenty, you select five. That's it. No. Yeah. Yeah. It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen. Like, selecting the menus. Sure, without titanium alloy, it's going to be light. Of course. Okay. Okay. And Moreover, moreover it covers it covers all the end goals. Even if it is, you know, it's very rounded, but still you got some rubber fruit here, and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that. Okay. Okay. Sure, sure, just look at it. It's full adaptable. Yeah, you can fit it into your palm, you know. Mm, It's two point one seven. No, uh you just Number. Yeah. How What what's the limit? Uh, it's it's okay that I don't know, 'cause uh it's not my field. Twelve bucks. Okay, now Mm-hmm. Check that number also. It's it's flat. It's flat. But it is flat, you Look. It's curvable, but it's not curved. Oh, okay. Mm. Mm. Well, n Why three? Why three? For buttons. No, buttons just normal. That's for buttons. But buttons are standard. Well, as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng, I mean, producing electricity from mechanical energy. So, the point is that when you take device and push the button, you produce enough energy to make electricity. Yeah, that you don't need a battery. So, it's something like hand dynamo robot. A real high-tech version of it. Okay, but l Why not. Let's do that. And I propose to So uh, about chips. Advanced chip on print, right? So, put minus one there, please. Why not? And? So, was there result? Let's have a look. Why? Oops. Yeah. Why not. Minus. Good. And a battery and a battery, yeah. Now it's fancy, let's add one instead of two. Well, I don't know. I don't know. I am not sure who was programming this calculator, you know. 'Cause uh I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number. Next slide. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. M maybe not, huh? What was the Oh yeah, what was good? Everything. What was bad? Yeah. A good leader, you know, a good leader is somewhere in the shade and Of course. Uh Not to waste time, that's important. We need time f New materials. Budget. Alright.. Okay. Yeah, it is. So, we see, we can even forecast. they propose us like celebration, everything, we could forecast it, right? You? It was you. Okay. Okay.
