Ah, pinball. Huh. Uh, maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation. And you will see it. I'm next, okay. Yes. No. Here we go. Uh, at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want, our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to. And then, I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs, about uh what battery is in it, what kind of buttons also. First uh, the younger people, they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours. Like, totally yellow, totally red. Uh, so it's visible. Uh, the shapes are curved and round, like uh you also said. Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones, straight and uh flat and long. But to give him the shape of your hand, so you it's easier to use or something like that. But that's just an idea. And then, I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control. The battery, there are few options. Uh, I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery. So, everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket. Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch. When you uh shake it a few times, it it's loaded. Uh, the the form of the remote control, I think it's also nice have it curved. And maybe like it's hand-shaped. Uh, so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons. Uh material, you use plastic. Hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time. And also rubber because the younger people like that, what we see in the research. Uh the push-buttons. We have one new thing uh discovered. It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse. Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels. When you want to go m move up, you just scroll up and click on the button, if you wanna see the next, uh if you wanna see that channel. And also for the mouse, uh for the volume, it's also uh easy to use. Just scroll a bit up, scroll a bit down. And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this, and you get it here. You can do it with your thumb. And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one, you can see channel one. The electrics um with a scroll push uh button, we must use regular uh chips. There are also uh simple chips. They are uh cheaper. Um, but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control, and I think there are a lot of those uh things, and people won't buy it any more. They have seen enough of it. And you have also advanced um chips. But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen. And the costs will increase a lot more. And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_, and the chip who is more expensive. And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control, that we then use the primary colours. Like, you get a yellow uh remote control, red one, blue one, et cetera. You have any more questions about this? I think the main thing is we look at the costs. And not too basic, not a basic remote control, who everybody already has. Not with an L_C_D_. No. Yeah. But then, what I say, the costs will uh get a lot higher. Th then you'll see it on the television. Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television, it's like you see uh one to twenty, you go uh uh s scroll up, and push number tw twenty. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think the younger people will have newer televisions, which can provide our uh remote control. Yes. But that won't be a problem. I think. No, but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls. And I think, what I said, everybody has them uh has them already. And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros. Uh, and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing. And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news. I got it on my screen and it was uh higher. But I don't know uh how much higher. That's true. But then we'll I think we must discuss who uh what will be better. If we have a better shape of the um remote control, or better options on it. With a scroll menu, a w scroll thing, and a L_C_D_. And then a flat um remote control. Or, a more hand-shaped remote control, with scroll, without L_C_D_. I can uh look on my uh Uh Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip. A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip, which is a higher price range. The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip. Doesn't say. That's from my manufacturing division. Yes? Changing covers. Nope. Uh, uh-uh. How w how we how we make it? Uh Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all Yeah, but if I paint with More like something M like Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it. Uh I have to. I'm not a designer. It's more three D_. Like, um when you have a part here. This is the remote control. And then you have something like th this under it. So, it's easier to get it like this. It's like a gun. And it has to be soft, yeah. So, you can squeeze in it and Sorry? Buttons on top of it. And here. The scrolling. You can do it with your thumb. But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here. One till uh uh zero till nine. And the b Yeah? Or two buttons. If uh 'Kay c If we do If we use one, then we'll have just a switch on it, and you'll just switch it, and now it's the sound to switch back with the menu uh button. And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it. Just not like all the other ones, with uh this thing, and uh here an arrow, here an arrow, here an arrow, here an arrow. Because uh, from h hundred uh remote controls, ninety nine have it. Uh, then we have it on the T_V_, the menu. I don't know. It's like some sort of uh teletext option, but we don't have teletext. And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it, then the costs will uh be much higher. 'Kay. But you all like this kind of thing. Uh With the scroll button. And and this one has to be soft. And this has to be harder, because when it falls, it mu mu must not burst. Or some kind of rubber around it. Yeah. Yeah. Ah that's nice. Here. Trigger. Paint it? With the scroll thing on, like this? So? Draw it. But is it easy to use? When you have it on your left side, and Separate, more separate, h yeah. Yeah. On the left a scroll button, and on the right a scroll button. But would it be easy to use then? If it's like you have a big uh I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for. They were like round curves, uh different uh Okay, okay, okay. Mm-hmm. Personally, I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle. With the switch button. No like uh Oh, you mean like that. Uh, then you can also have like uh th um Yeah, and joystick, I think. Yeah like in a laptop, s uh s some sort of thing. A little bit bigger, with easier thi I don't know. Or no scroll uh things. Just a shape. And No, no. It won't work. Yeah. Uh-huh. Or a remote control more like joystick. A small one like this, like a Nintendo uh k Playstation thing. No, no, no. I mean the the shape of the remote control. Just like a Playstation thing. Yeah. No, that's okay, I got Uh they're not uh in details. It's more expensive or less expensive, huh? Then I have to come with it. I got my personal costs. I I don't I don't know the costs. Then I'll uh make something up. Yeah, or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery. Yeah, I think it's uh, yeah, more expensive. Yeah. Okay. Depends on the scroll. If we use a scroll, then we have the uh regular chip. If we don't use a scroll, then we can use the simple chip. And that's Uh the most expensive. Yeah. If we Yeah. If we No okay scroll-wheel. So, I have this. So, it will be uh the advanced chip, or the uh regu uh or the regular chip. Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it? Just use your thumb. If you Yeah. I use my thumb. Yeah. If you have a joystick on No, if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller. And you move up, f forward, down, left. Then you have uh just, yeah, a little bit curved. It's not just uh straight. That's how we use it. That's why they make joysticks like that, I think. Yeah? 'Kay. Here's our designer. Yeah. Yeah, why not. It's for the younger people. It's something new. Now we put uh rubber around it. Hard plastic, uh the shape, and around it hard uh around it rubber. And the uh the hand shape is also rubber. Huh. This is something new. Costs are okay. Oh, that's us together. Yes. 'Kay. Bye bye.
Mm. Ah. Hey. Ah. Now I have my screen back too. Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting. Large. A lot a lot of buttons buttons. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yep. Yeah. But, thi i uh This is with an L_C_D_? No, not. Uh, can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without? 'Cause it I think if we have an L_C_D_, it will also sell a lot better. And that might uh bring back the costs uh Huh. 'Kay. My turn? Mm. So So Yeah. So, my uh presentation is about trend-watching. Uh, I did some trend-watching. It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends. 'Cause if you don't, you won't sell. So, well how we did do that? Uh, well we made an investigation of the market, by Trendwatchers. They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan. Of course, well known for their uh trend uh trends. And well, uh what did you find? Uh, we have two groups, young and trendy, and the old and rich. Well th and the young and trendy, they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes, shoes, and also uh products. And um, material? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling. And to get a feeling for what it is, uh here is an image of it. Then the old and rich. They like uh dark colours, and simple, recognisable shapes. And um, they also like uh familiar material, uh especially wood. Now, another picture. To get a feeling for this. Well, uh then already come to my personal preferences. We uh aim at the younger market. So, we should also be uh look at their uh trends. However, with trends it's always if there's it's now. It it it might last one year, and next year it be uh can be totally different. And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year. So, we m must not just only look at what the trend is now, as it might be totally different next year. So, that's uh one thing to keep in mind. Yeah. Any questions? Yeah. Mm. Can make several uh concepts. We have this, and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand. Yeah I I I uh yes. Yeah. A g Mm.. Yeah. And i if we go to uh But if we have uh a me Yeah. If we have a menu, uh how do we uh choose other options? Yeah. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Yeah. Yeah. M uh yeah, maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um more separate, yeah. Like, you have the menu button in between uh Yeah. Think we have we have now two buttons missing. The uh um The mute button. We have two buttons missing. The mute button. And um, the to to uh have to uh numbers Okay. But, uh Okay. And on the L_C_D_, how much it costs? Uh, it costs extra? Yeah. Yes. Uh Uh, yeah, but Yeah. If you If we have uh then something standing here, with the L_C_D_. Um, Yeah. I can't see the. But, uh the easy of uh, th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it. Uh, for us it's about to sell it. Uh One. No. You have more. You have still ten. Yeah. What? Okay. Okay. See you at the next meeting.
Hmm. Oh. Mine. Oh, great. Uh Yes, well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept. Uh, first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose, uh show you some samples, uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe, already. And uh my personal preferences. Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off. The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off. The channels buttons, one to nine, and uh off uh uh zero to nine, and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine. Uh the volume and channel quadrants, uh left and right, up and down arrows, to uh do the volume and channel. And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display. Um, I found some uh interesting uh uh samples. Examples. Um, well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh Yeah. Yeah. Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long. Um, power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right. Um, well we see the the the same uh arrows. Like there. And uh Yeah, well arrow b buttons can be blue. And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons. Some buttons have icons like the play and stop, but we don't use that. But uh, these we we have to choose the right icons, or or letters. Uh this is the V_ for volume, but they're both uh a V_. So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that. Um Yeah. So, that's Uh, well Yeah. I thought that was our uh idea. So, uh how Like this. Or or this. And that the menu button is okay. Yeah, okay. Uh, so the The icons on the arrows, as well, you mean. Yeah. Uh, well that's something to uh think about. Okay. Um, well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already, or in the next uh meeting. But uh, as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo, I would uh recommend a yellow case. Uh, round edges. The logo at the bottom. And uh, well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour. So, it's good. Uh, recognisable. K so, I think. Uh, no. Not too much. But uh No, no, no. But this has to be has to be trendy and uh and Uh, yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons, and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion. That was that. Hmm. No. Mm, yes. What? Mm. Yeah. But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then? Yeah, okay. But but how Yeah. How Okay. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger. Like uh Just to uh Oh, like a Yeah. But if you put push the the menu button Yeah, wh what Yes, but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm, yeah. Yeah. It's uh Or you can uh turn it inside. But that's No, that's true.. Okay. Cookie.
Okay. Well, let's start. What are we doing? Oops. Okay. Okay. Not doing. Uh Very good. Okay. we have presentations. So first, it's your turn. Yeah. Isn't it amazing. Industrial Designer. Interface concept. Can you go back one page? For the uh menu, what do we use for that? We don't have buttons for the menu. Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel. Okay. But uh You have to put it on the Yeah. Yeah but, has to be clear that you can use the arrows. Mm-hmm. Yes. The second one. Okay. Not too much colours. No, it's not flower power. S okay. Okay. Thank you. So, you're next. Hmm. No, isn't. But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons. Then you can scroll, you see what number, and then you push. But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel. If you don't Hmm, yes. But then. Yeah, then you go one down one up. When you scroll. Yeah but like we said before, it has to be used on every television. So you may not be uh No. The television must do that. So Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room. And mostly they are smaller. So Most the times that are not advanced televisions. Okay. That's important. Yeah. Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_. It's very important. Yeah, more expensive. But how much? Oh. Okay. Okay. Well, thank you. Next. No. It's clear. So now, it's uh Ah, let's see. Now, w we have to decide Well, we have to decide on the concept. So, we have to look at 'S next. Components and user interface concept. So Now, we have to make some concept. Maybe one of you can paint it on the board. First, uh user interface. Yes, a concept on uh Just Yeah, but maybe we can paint it. Uh, what do we want? I'll paint. Okay. Well Something like this? Or Shapes or What do we need? Yes, okay. Okay. And you have to. Yeah. So, it has to be soft? Okay. And uh, the buttons? Buttons. No, it won't. But, well there one for the sound and one for the channels. Uh, two scroll uh wheels. That's th that's more difficult. It's better in But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu. Yeah, but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it? You don't know. So, there's no menu. No. So you can't use it. Okay, we make two concepts. One with L_C_D_. One without L_C_D_. Good concept. But That's one. It's one. Two. Number two. No. But when you handle it, you put it on and off. It's not good to use. Yeah, but I'll zap. Fuck. Out. No, it's not good. Now, second concept. One with L_C_D_, one without L_C_D_. Then uh Paint it. One with two scroll buttons and one with without. Yeah. Uh, one with a with a menu, and one without a menu. And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_. Unbelievable. Do I have to do everything. Blank. You have Not so difficult. Uh, that's the menu. There for the L_C_D_ screen. You have to For the menu. Mm-hmm. One that way. And one that way. So Then it depends on the cost. S On and off. When it's not too big. Just like a a phone. Yes, okay. Very good. Is it better? When you uh the menu, you have to go there there there there. Yeah, okay. That's that's the outside. But now the First the buttons. Sorry? Mute. And the other. Yeah. Not so difficult. But how do you wanna solve it? Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy. Then you go down, you switch, you go into the right, you switch, you go down. Yeah. A joystick. Yeah. But is it uh Does that break, a joystick? Or a small one just like in a laptop. Mean, it's better. But how expensive it is? Oh. Why do I pay you for? Um, well um Better ideas. For the young peoples I think scroll button's good. So Think we have to keep them. Yeah, but is it That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better. A small one. No just like in a a laptop. Small, round. Then it's not so big. Oh the sh Yeah, but then you can You have to use t with one hand. So Maybe, if it's possible, it's not too expensive, I think a joystick is better. A small one. So, please look at it. Yeah we I think you get it. So, after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it. Yes. Your problem. Not mine. Okay. So, do we have other concepts? Then for the components, we use a normal battery. Then it's Ch cheapest way, I think. No, no kinetic. Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive. So we use a normal battery. Chip. Depends on the L_C_D_. Scroll. Yeah. And uh, we If you use the L_C_D_, we have to Yes, okay. So, depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll. Okay. Okay. So, uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and But, it has to be small. I think. If you have pistol, it L_C_D_'s not easy. Y y Yeah but If you use a phone. k Yeah, but but then you have it. Like, th if you have pistol, you have it so. And the screen is Well, then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen. Yeah. No. No, no. Yeah, but then you look forward. And then you can y N well, if you have to look at it. Then it goes like this. If th n well Yes, of course. That's good good. But the um, it may not break. Okay. If that's possible. Okay. Yeah of course. Okay. Then this is the design. And the buttons are on the next page. So, depends on the cost. So, um we have one minute. I think. No. More. Seven. Next meeting. Thirty minutes. So hurry up. You two stay here. Paint it. Now you have to. So I think it's clear. Check your mail. So It has to be ready in the next meeting. So Next meeting is called the detailed design. So Everyth everything has to be ready. Thanks for your attention.
