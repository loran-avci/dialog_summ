 none 	o_k  so we re live 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	are we live or are we memorex 
 none 	we re somewhere in between  o_k  so we have some sheets for uh some standard doohickies to  
 none 	o_k  so that s
 none 	wait 
 none 	right  so 
 none 	you re going to sit there 
 none 	is that alright 
 none 	yeah  o_k  maybe i ll put this thing here then 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  so this is february second  eh  two thousand  this is eh meeting number one with adam and dan and morgan  about five o clock uh in the afternoon 
 none 	a range of microphones 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what s this one here  this   this one is   has a couple of cheezy electrettes and  
 none 	yeah  that s   that s the dummy   dummy p_d_a 
 none 	that s connected too  or    
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  it is 
 none 	that s connected 
 none 	it s got two   to both channels 
 none 	yeah  both channels 
 none 	oh  hang on 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  it is at the moment 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	this is  
 none 	although the gain is pretty low 
 none 	so for the um read numbers task 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	hang on  let s   let s  
 none 	i have extracted these  
 none 	o_k let s just   let s just name the microphones 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so i m speaking on the ear mounted uh wired headset thing 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	right and i m now talking on microphone number two  uh  the wireless microphone number two 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  i have no idea which one i m   i m on  oh one  oh  i m number one 
 none 	i m  
 none 	you re on one 
 none 	absolutely 
 none 	o_k  which is a   a l  a lapel  in fact it s sticking through my lapel 
 none 	yes 
 none 	o_k so this is   this is the p_z_m nearest the eh eh the machine room end of the table 
 none 	actually  i 
 none 	then there s   i know  but yeah  it s number three  it says  but we ll be able to figure it out  this is at the middle of the table
 none 	this further down the table 
 none 	and this   this one is right at the end of the table  o_k 
 none 	and then we ve got the uh  
 none 	this is the left side of the dummy p_d_a and this would be the right side 
 none 	i think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody s home movies 
 none 	yes  it ll be pretty horrible 
 none 	yeah  o_k 
 none 	very exciting 
 none 	so  what i have on these forms here is for the read numbers   read digits tasks and it s extracted directly from aurora and uh  
 none 	so what i was thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading   reading the numbers on the form 
 none 	o_k  what do we do with the stuff on top 
 none 	fill it out 
 none 	but i  
 none 	do we say it after we  
 none 	no  just write it down 
 none 	no  you don t need to 
 none 	what are we   why are we writing it down 
 none 	so that when we transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing 
 none 	oh 
 none 	o_k
 none 	that s good  so i don t need to fill that out right now  so maybe we should just say it 
 none 	w 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	why don t you want to fill it out right now  just so that  
 none 	so then we re not spending the time writing it out  so that we re spending the time talking 
 none 	well  how about you give me one of those and we can fill it out and morgan can read and then we can do it like that 
 none 	i m just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  yeah  yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	and so you have to be sure to pause between each line  since we re going to be segmenting it and then doing it that way 
 none 	oh 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k  so this is morgan  i m going to read some numbers now  one two three zero eight two five two one zero nine six three seven five eight six zero one one six two nine
 none 	o_ o_ two o_ six  
 none 	whoops that s a mistake  disfluency  scratch  start over 
 none 	o_ o_ two one six four one zero zero seven zero four
 none 	that s my group 
 none 	o_k  so  adam janin next  uh transcript number two on a wireless headset number two  two seven o_ three six seven four five seven one nine zero eight five nine eight zero seven four three seven
 none 	o_ zero nine nine five one
 none 	o_k  this is dan on the uh wired headset  transcript number one  two one four eight three eight eight four three o_ six five seven one five five two seven six seven eight
 none 	o_ three o_ zero two one five one eight
 none 	so i definitely wasn t pausing enough between them 
 none 	this is   these are things we will find out 
 none 	that ll be an issue 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  i don t know if i said mine was transcript zero  but it was 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	oh  good 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	that s a little bit 
 none 	can i have something to write on the back of 
 none 	so  so where are we in this  let s see  so we now   we now have a few mikes that work  how long did it take you to set this up 
 none 	thanks 
 none 	oh  it didn t   doesn t take   well  i mean as you see we haven t really set it up that well  but it doesn t   it doesn t take long to set up  i mean 
 none 	we just came up here one night after recording so it took like twenty minutes something like that 
 none 	right and that   that included a fair amount of fiddling around  since it s   it s more or less the first time we ve tried to do it 
 none 	i mean it s  
 none 	yeah  i mean the equipment  
 none 	right 
 none 	the equip  me and adam went through it yesterday  just looked at everything  but it s all kind of here and set up  so it s just a question of turning it all on 
 none 	and  um   running the program 
 none 	i mean  ev  eventually we ll want to like tape that over and run them up through the center so that wires aren t   aren t   people aren t tripping over the wires and so on 
 none 	right 
 none 	are we gonna   i mean  is it gonna be over there  or is it gonna be in there 
 none 	um  it s   it s gonna b  it s   for reasons   because of the microphones runs we want that chunk there  there s more equipment in there 
 none 	but there s   the idea is that there are these microphones on the table  there are some cables coming down sort of under a nice mat  and then that s   they   a bunch of them get sort of converged with digital there 
 none 	and the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors  so that   so that it s not open to fiddling 
 none 	so that s what s gonna happen 
 none 	right 
 none 	that s
 none 	do we have like a cabinet on order or do we just need to do that 
 none 	we need to do that  it s on a list of things to do  i keep on hoping that they re gonna get done but they don t 
 none 	well  i   i can help them get done um one question is budget  do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on things like cabinets or a hard drive or things like that 
 none 	i  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh   i mean  i don t know  did we s  did we spend our   the budget already that we had 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  how much are we talking about here 
 none 	um 
 none 	i don t know  a cabinet is probably going to cost a hundred dollars  two hundred dollars something like that 
 none 	i mean 
 none 	yeah  i mean  you know  we   we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without   without worrying about it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  i think   um i m more worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that   that uh stuff gets broken or   or you know 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  i think our intention at this point is when we re not using it to record a meeting we ll coil them all up and put them under so that people will not be tripping over them and so on 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so 
 none 	but  well we should get to a   a nice kind of working state of our set up as quickly as possible 
 none 	yeah  and there s also the minor matter  it d be kind of nice to able to bring people in and say  yes  this is where we do such and such   and then be able to see uh  you know  some kind of   i mean it s less important than doing what we re doing right now but  
 none 	right  not have it  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so 
 none 	i mean there s one big issue with the equipment still  which is um ultimately we re gonna   well the idea is to have any number of these wired headsets  but there s this amplification problem 
 none 	i built this thing  it s   that s   it s very noisy  we re actually recording   i m   i m going through it at the moment  but it s so noisy that i am not using for this  it s   it s designed to be used for the   for the desktop meeting as well 
 none 	but i m using   running that through my uh damp machine as a pre amp as an alternative 
 none 	well  we should be able to just go buy some preamps  i would think 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s just   it eh
 none 	you see how clumsy this is right  i have to use these batteries to bias them 
 none 	and i m only get two channels and there re a bunch of  
 none 	there are like three connectors in the circuit 
 none 	the thing is  like  it s   it s not s  it s not that the thing doesn t exist commercially  but there isn t one unit which does the whole thing in one   in one swoop 
 none 	so it seemed like it was a good idea to make one  um
 none 	and i m still not sure  i mean  i think i probably know how to fix this  i can probably build it better so it doesn t have such noise  but it s kind of a buy  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  ultimately we re gonna need to build one anyway 
 none 	are we 
 none 	sure  because we  we re gonna have to put it in a p_d_a 
 none 	well  we could just  
 none 	well 
 none 	right  if we have microphones in a p_d_a it s gonna need bias and a pre amp 
 none 	i guess i d sort of figured that   that jim would do that at some point  right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well n 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	jim is busy at the moment  that s the problem  i was kind of hoping that jim was going to build this box 
 none 	but um   but he hasn t had time 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well   i think   i think he is quite interested in doing it  but 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well
 none 	if it s too noisy and if there s something we can buy  again for  you know  moderate amount of price  even if it takes a couple boxes or something  maybe we should just do it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and then   and then later we can uh replace it with  
 none 	because there may be other considerations that will go into the design  i mean  uh our getting some experience with this may help to determine some of things that are   i don t know   might change this design 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	so 
 none 	there was uh a statement made uh which i don t think is right  by the way  but   there was a statement made at the uh darpa communicator meeting i was at recently that um microphone   multiple microphones at a distance of less than three feet or something like that were totally useless  completely irrelevant 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah  for nois  noise cancelling 
 none 	you   you mean for noise cancelling  or    
 none 	um  my counter argument is   is an   uh uh um  a white rat  uh  which has th  it s two microphones exceedingly close together and it works pretty well 
 none 	oh 
 none 	um but  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	this happened  
 none 	do they mean omnidirectional  is that their point  i mean all the noise cancelling mikes  they re   you know  they re a few m  millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions 
 none 	i think   uh  i mean  uh my guess is that means it s just that if it s   if it s near field  the mathematics of beam   beam steering is different 
 none 	but 
 none 	oh  i see 
 none 	if the f  if the wavefronts are not approximately planar then you can t just do delay and sum and expect it to work 
 none 	it s   oh  o_k  so they re not talking about how far apart the mikes are  they re talking about how far they are from the speaker 
 none 	i guess  yeah 
 none 	right  but i think that if   my point is i guess if you   if you have a um   a uh s  a volume in between the two   the two uh uh sensors and you do something cleverer  there clearly are ways to get more out of it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  right  right  i mean the   um
 none 	the   the weird thing is that actually delay in some beam forming is not   is not the clever thing to do  the   the   the underwater guys do this stuff which is different 
 none 	and it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible 
 none 	rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get separation  you sort of   you want them very close  and  
 none 	and the math is too difficult for me to understand but it s   but it s there 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  there are various points in meeting where people were making uh uh very strong statements as a matter of fact  like one shouldn t even question it and this was one of them that was kind of funny 
 none 	um but i   i   i   what i take it to mean is doing   doing the dumb thing uh with two microphones would be very difficult to get too much out of it but
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think it will be interesting to do other things that aren t dumb 
 none 	so i   i still think it s potentially interesting to do that  although we  we ll have to be uh a  aware of this if we re writing proposals about it  wherever  that there may well be reviewers who will say   well everyone knows that you can t get anything out of it if it s   if it s close  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	do they believe you can get speaker location out of it  cuz that s   that s one way we could sneak it in 
 none 	uh  that is an interesting point 
 none 	yeah  certainly you can get some  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well we could  
 none 	i mean  by the time   we ll have   we ll have data so we can actually you know  demonstrate that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well 
 none 	hopefully 
 none 	oh  you mean for location 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  depends on who s working on it 
 none 	well  we re getting some   we  we re getting some right now 
 none 	yeah  right  but someone has to write some software to   to actually do it  someone might 
 none 	right  right  but i mean 
 none 	well someone  someone might be interested in   in it 
 none 	oh that s uh   i was just thinking one thing we may wanna do is put the fake p_d_a right in front of someone instead of in the middle of the table like we have it now  on the thought that   my vision of it is you know each of us will have our little p_d_a in front of us and so the acoustics   uh you might want to try to match the acoustics 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	maybe 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but on the other hand  suppose that uh  you re the only one uh who is advanced enough in this thinking to actually bring such a p_d_a to   to a meeting and   and   and therefore you bring it in  and you probably want it to be as near to people as possible so you might in fact shove it to the middle of the table 
 none 	no  and i don t need to meet with those people 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well 
 none 	yep  yep  for those those we can make several   several more of these and then we can have actual recording with you know three p_d_as 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  i think we should 
 none 	i mean  i think at least with two  right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	because uh one of the th  one of the fantasies that was at least fun to talk about was that uh uh o_k maybe you th  you re   the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they re a few inches apart  but what if you have two of these things 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and you know we have this   this idea of the handshake back and forth and say  i m here  i m here   we re now an array  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	right  right 
 none 	yeah  and that   that seems very uh easy to believe scenario  i mean  given the number of palm pilots we ve got on the table right now  so 
 none 	that s right 
 none 	three  right  so i guess this a pretty dense group but it  it s getting a lot higher 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah
 none 	yeah  but   but that   it s
 none 	we re not  even  you know   it s   we re just   it s not like we  
 none 	we   we may be technical  but we re not particularly p_d_a people 
 none 	so it s   that s just how it is 
 none 	well  i m trying to be  so 
 none 	well  i know  well  that s true  i mean 
 none 	except i s  got a p_d_a way before   well i was doing hand  i was doing wearable computers at boeing  so i guess i sort of count  but 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so uh   so where are we uh now  i mean so we ve just   uh we re doing this recording so we show we can   we re capable of doing recording uh there s i guess a little more wiring to do or something to have   to have more   if we had more people participating in the meeting we d wouldn t quite be ready for that 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh 
 none 	well we ve got   we ve got   right now we could have two more people on wireless  with a trip to leo s audio we could get a third extra person on wireless  and uh right now we could have three more   three more people wearing mikes like this  and that would just work  i mean i m not sure how   how good the quality is on this mike but i think it s going to be o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so we could actually have eight people with   with headset mikes with  i mean  basically no extra effort 
 none 	well 
 none 	five with wireless  so we could have eight 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	nine 
 none 	nine  excuse me  nine  five with wireless and four without  and four with wired 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  we don t have headsets though 
 none 	yeah  we have the um   the ones we ve been using  the ones we got for the p_c 
 none 	oh  o_k so we just have to c  wander around and collect them up 
 none 	yeah  yeah  i think we have three of those 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so  and the h 
 none 	uh  there s one in my office  so 
 none 	right  right  they don t all work  but the nice ones  the um plan  plantronic ones work 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  we ll just have to see if that works 
 none 	so a little bit of futzing  there s the issue about a cabinet  we might want to change some pre amps 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so we can do some more recordings but there s   there s a little   little bit of ramp up on that over the next month  say 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	right and also i would like to work out some of the software issues a little more completely  so  um  you know  we re gonna want to resample and con  and bring them over to another machine and uh um organize the   how we re gonna store it all 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah we were talking about that a little bit over coffee today  that   that um uh if you downsample it sounded like it came   it sounded like it was something like a gig  gigabyte an hour if you didn t downsample and once you downsampled then it was something like four hundred megabytes an hour  if you used all   if you used all   no  if you used all the channels  something like that 
 none 	per channel  or    
 none 	we figured out that it was t  twelve gig  twelve gigabytes an hour  for   for all the channels  was that with or without the  
 none 	it was more than that 
 none 	i thought it was one gigabyte 
 none 	it couldn t be twelve 
 none 	cuz no  we ve only   no  i mean we ve only got four gigabytes and that
 none 	we said  four gigabytes would give us twenty minutes before we did anything else 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  and then we   then we cut it in half 
 none 	and then we cut in half  by  
 none 	how d you cut it 
 none 	but  
 none 	by s  saving sixteen bits on instead of thirty   instead of thirty two 
 none 	o_k  so that s   so that s two gigabytes 
 none 	and then  
 none 	well no i mean it s uh four gigabytes for forty minutes 
 none 	that s forty minutes
 none 	right  but that s at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels 
 none 	so  six gigabytes 
 none 	forty eight kilohertz  yeah 
 none 	so we can actually triple that 
 none 	so you can   right  so you can
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  hang on   so that would   o_k
 none 	i came out at the gig an hour  at one point  that   that s one computation i did for sixteen channels  sixteen bit 
 none 	well i think it s  
 none 	i think it s two gig an hour 
 none 	is it two gig an hour  i m off by an order of magni  that s alright  order of two  factor of two 
 none 	cuz like  we don t   maybe we don t   we don t need to save all channels  right  so  on average 
 none 	we could   we don t   we   we wouldn t use all the channels  necessarily 
 none 	oh  we ll do the higher math later  maybe but it s   so it s   so maybe like a gig or two a   an hour  um but   um  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  that is a bit more than i thought 
 none 	how much here would we have to reformat the drive in there to get some of the more space cuz it   i mean it s a nine gig drive and there s four gig on sc  on scratch and there s about three gig unused  it looked like  on the home directory 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i m sure  yeah 
 none 	i just don t know enough about linux  how hard is it to repartition 
 none 	it s a pain 
 none 	it s a pain 
 none 	i mean  you know  because   cuz we ve got data on  user   right  and then we d have to back it all up and copy it back on again 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah so this ll take some thought cuz we have   we   um
 none 	if we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we   we wanna ha  have part of our work be on feature extraction  it means that we need to have waveforms available somehow 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	right  so i ve   i ve already created a  u_   u_  doctor speech  data  m_r  directory  or had jane do it and uh um   but there s not a lot of free space around 
 none 	so it   it   it has currently about four gig on the drive that i think she s going to put it on um 
 none 	no 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and so we need   we definitely need to go buy uh you know forty gig   fifty gig of drive   drive space 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we don t need all   we don t necessarily need it all on line  i mean it will be different subsets  so you won t   you won t  you know  do all sixteen channels in a single  
 none 	that s true  i hadn t even thought about that  although it d be kind of interesting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what would you do  i mean  
 none 	you typically train   i mean you d have fi  you d have fifty hours we d only use one of the p_z_m channels  something like this  and so that would  you wouldn t have to use all sixteen channels at once 
 none 	but it s kind of painful for   because basically  if we put them on c_ds then each c_d will have all the channels for one recording  and then when you want to build the p_files  you just want to get one of those files off each of the sessions and  
 none 	yeah  it s pretty horrible 
 none 	so what would we do for training  so if we re   if we re training distant mi  we d just use one of them 
 none 	yeah  well  maybe two of them  but i mean we wouldn t use   we d only use the distant mikes  right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah so it might be four 
 none 	right  but it wouldn t be sixteen 
 none 	well  although we wanted to get alignments from the close mike stuff 
 none 	but that s a separate training 
 none 	right  but you don t want to be constantly take   putting that on disk and off disk and on disk 
 none 	no wait  more disk is better  absolutely  i mean my   my preference would be to get   get ourselves a hundred gig of disk  and just not bother 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the thing is it s really not very expensive right now 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so it s more of an issue of   of structuring it with uh the uh sys admin folks so we don t panic them and figuring out where it goes 
 none 	and back up 
 none 	well  we don t   it doesn t need to be backed up 
 none 	right if   if we   if we burn it all on c_d rom  then  um  in fact  we could you know   we could throw away the broadcast news stuff and put it on there or something like that 
 none 	right  then it doesn t need to be backed up 
 none 	yeah  we were talking about that   i m not sure if anyone s still using it  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think the only one using it has been javier  but at this point i think it s   he s only been using it for features that he calculated quite a while ago  so if nobody else is doing feature calculation  
 none 	somebody used it recently 
 none 	yeah 
 send_email 	i ll  send mail to  speech local   
 send_email 	i ll  send mail to  speech local  and see if  anyone s still using it   
 none 	pardon 
 none 	how much space is that using up  do you have any idea 
 none 	it s uh twenty c_ds  so that s twelve gigabytes 
 none 	so that would last us for a while 
 none 	yeah  couple hours 
 none 	well  anyway for this   this recording we re fine cuz we re only   we re only   how many mikes are we recording right now 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  right now we don t have any choice  it r  still records all sixteen channels  it s just most of them are all zeroes 
 none 	so that   that s on our list too 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  well that we can
 none 	do something about 
 none 	yep 
 none 	it s mostly a question of user interface  how do we   how do we specify which ones are on 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  so we don t store any of our audio formats compressed in any way do we 
 none 	so these large sections when you guys aren t talking  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	probably  we could   we could probably just run shorten on them or something and it will get a big win 
 none 	i think that s a good  
 none 	run what on those 
 none 	shorten 
 none 	tony robinson s uh lossless compression thing 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	what s it do 
 none 	um  it   it does a_r modeling and so it looks at a section  it runs an a_r model to sort of r  w  to whiten it and then quantizes the residual with a nice   with the three bits it can get away with  something like that 
 none 	so i think it   on   on each block it ll   it ll compress you know if there s load on in any range it ll use ratio bits  i think it does that 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  so  p_z_ms 
 none 	yeah  well 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  it s something that   that we definitely need to look at with this 
 none 	maybe we shouldn t ve subsampled it down to sixteen bits for our first try 
 none 	well  it s o_k  it s only the first try  i   what i m thinking is um obviously we can do the   we can   we can choose any sixteen bits from the twenty  four  so we can just have different gain things that we use you know per channel 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the p_z_ms are better than the middle sixteen bits 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think   probably the bottom four bits are not any good 
 none 	regardless  yeah 
 none 	right  although you know it claims they are  but probably the  
 none 	w  i was just noticing on the   on the   there s a view meter  software view meter and the p_z_m gain is real low  so 
 none 	yeah  so i think initially we should take up more space until we ve analyzed this and get a better sense of it because uh we don  i mean we re not talking about forty or fifty hours at this point we re talking about a half hour of   of speech and so uh we should look at this carefully but  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i was interested when i saw the twenty four on there  wow  i mean that s probably eight bits of noise  yeah  so 
 none 	oh  yeah 
 none 	oh yeah 
 none 	yeah  that s right  we ve got lots of bits of noise 
 none 	these theories things are pretty amazing 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and
 none 	and there s help   help they seem   they seem good though they seem to be
 none 	it s some sort of oversampling thing i imagine  right 
 none 	didn t we already get that  cuz you   you can t have uh component tolerances that are uh sixteen million   one in sixteen million parts  so 
 none 	oh  god knows  yeah  yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	right the other   other thing another issue is just getting a sound card up here 
 none 	you know  i assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output 
 none 	that   that card   that machine s got sound   they ve got a sound blaster built into it 
 none 	oh  it s just not working 
 none 	i just   i just disabled it cuz i wanted to find out how well the sound infrastructure would deal with both at once but i think yeah  that s  uh   probably it will be fine 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  that way we don t   we can t listen to it on this machine 
 none 	i m s 
 none 	there s no 
 none 	oh 
 none 	for a couple of reasons 
 none 	well  but the   
 none 	there are two ways we could listen to it  there s a sound   there s actually sound output built into this thing  but the driver   i haven t   the driver may not support it yet  and then there s also the sound or the sound card built in  but i don t know how to   i don t know how the operating system would like having two sound cards 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	but we can f_t_p stuff over  right  so it s connected 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and we ve looked at it so we know it s working  i mean  you can see the little squiggles  and it looks like speech so you just can t listen 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um 
 none 	one suggestion i have is that um
 none 	i think this   maybe we should just read some more   you made more of these  right  i think we should read some more because   because this is very f  we   we need to   to work the   the   the uh   the talkers more because we re not gonna have that many meetings and this is a pretty tiny amount of data 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so maybe we should do another number list and  
 none 	well right i   i just did ten per page i could easily do twenty per page 
 none 	it s just a question of uh of how much uh annoyance i wanted to put uh people going to meetings through 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well this is us  we ll have a fair amount of annoyance yeah i think uh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  can we do   we do another set  are we   are we   are we   sort of   we talked out about what we re  
 none 	sure 
 none 	sure 
 none 	well no  o_k  the question i still have about what we re going to do is what is   what   eh   o_k  so we can get the equipment set up so that basically we re in a situation where we can   with  you know  ten minutes of preparation  we can bring nine people in here and do a multi  channel recording 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	um 
 none 	what are   wh  when are we   are we going to do that  who are they going to be  what meetings are we going to record 
 none 	us  to begin with 
 none 	so which   which meetings   what meetings do we have 
 none 	i think that s the intention 
 none 	i mean like  us  being the meeting recorder people or  us  being anything that speech local does 
 none 	well  i think  
 none 	i think  um  certainly us  meeting recorder 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  us other groups  it just depends on how many meetings we re   we re having  um 
 none 	jerry also said it would be   he would be willing to have his group  some of the a_i meetings do it as well 
 none 	and we should have like   we should have decoder meetings and stuff 
 none 	and uh
 none 	exactly exactly  i think there are enough incidental meetings for us to   to do this  and if we can get it set up so it is convenient enough  um  then you can just do spontaneous meetings as well 
 none 	yeah  i mean that s the thing  it s o_k to g 
 none 	right 
 none 	which i m interested in  i mean  that s one of the things  the whole reason i want a p_d_a as opposed to a wired room is for spontaneous meetings 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	well  we ve got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case  cuz that   that s the real goal 
 none 	right 
 none 	that s right 
 none 	that s why i put ten on here instead of thirty or forty or fifty 
 none 	right  but i mean if we   if we want jerry s group to use it then we probably  won t ask them to read any numbers  right  cuz 
 none 	right  well  i   i bet they would be willing to do it the first few times  just for the novelty 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think they would 
 none 	and also he s   he s   he s got at least one woman 
 none 	that s great  i know 
 none 	oh  that s a good point 
 none 	and we re   we have a little problem of no women 
 none 	boy  that s abs  i had never   i hadn t even thought about that 
 none 	i know  it s a disaster 
 none 	yeah  well  when l  when liz uh shriberg starts coming  then there s another woman although she  
 none 	oh  man 
 none 	it s alright she doesn t mind as long as we don t video her  right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	ah  that s right  that was it  so 
 none 	maybe we should have the reading group here and force jane to come 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  no  well  actually we could have jane uh   jane s interested and curious about this stuff so she could attend one of   probably not the decoder meeting but some of the other stuff she would be interested enough and have her read  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we could   we could have the reading group in here  yeah 
 none 	yeah  i mean it s a different style  but i think that s alright 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean 
 none 	yeah  it s great 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  we were joking about having lunch up here but eating with the microphones  
 none 	um  i had another question briefly about transcription  so are we going get an external service or are we gonna do it  i mean who s gonna generate the transcripts 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um
 create_single_reminder 	i think that one of the neat things about having this little pilot thing from today is  we should try it a couple different ways  so we should try to do it internally  maybe ask   ask jane if we could get her to do it or   or   or have her supervise a linguistics student or somebody and uh see how long it takes  and you know  multiply out the cost  and then send   send the same thing out  or maybe split it in halves or something   something like that to a   to an outside service and uh see what that costs and how much hassle that is   
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	and then we can assess it 
 none 	yeah  the   the problem of course is that it s you know  in   in this meeting it s three four five six seven eight  it s nine transcripts  potentially 
 none 	well 
 none 	except that you wouldn t transcribe them all individually  right  you would send   i mean  uh a transcriber is used   i mean  i don t know  assume   presumably a transcriber transcribes a single meeting  right  and so they   they just have to indicate that the speaker changes 
 none 	no 
 none 	no 
 none 	right  this was   this was the point of having near zero skew  right 
 none 	right 
 none 	so you just pick one  with the best sounding one  and give it to somebody and they transcribe it 
 none 	oh  you re right  yeah  yeah  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	so the only thing we ll have to be careful with is that they re   well  what are they listening to 
 none 	so   so they   they re gonna   they re gonna have to make speaker assignments or something like this 
 none 	they re going to have to make speaker assignments  and wh  and which recording are they gonna listen to 
 none 	for one of   one of   
 none 	or we could mix   we could mix the   the headset mikes  you know  just to make a single high q  high quality   and we could do   and we could do all kinds of weird things like having you know squelch so that you only  you know   you only   you cut it out when there s no energy  so you don t  noise 
 none 	right 
 none 	oh  that would be interesting 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  you could do fancy things  but it seems like that s enough 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean there s   it s  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	if we   if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words then we can leverage that a lot by some clever cross thing to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this  probably 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yet 
 none 	so that   i mean  that s one chunk of work and just segmenting for this is gonna be another chunk of work 
 none 	um 
 none 	yeah  and   yeah  as much work as you want 
 none 	yeah
 none 	but uh i don t know  this meeting  so  say it s maybe going to be a half hour or something  and   and uh we ve heard estimates ranging between ten and twenty times uh real time to do this kind of transcription um so you know in   in principle then it ll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm  wow 
 none 	yeah 
 create_single_reminder 	and uh we ll  see which one of those seems closest to right and if they   ramped up  if towards the end it was faster you know  get some sort of sense from them uh from whoever does it and um then uh like i say  check it out with an external service and see if it s faster  cheaper  better  worse  whatever    then we ll go from there 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  one of the things i was thinking with transcript is that if we take the near field and we do an initial recognition pass  is it easier for a transcriber to correct a transcript  if the near field mike does a reasonably good job 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i bet it isn t  unless it s really close to right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i have   just because it s such an un 
 none 	the transcribing is sort of something i can imagine doing  whereas having this distraction of having sort of something that looks like it might be right but has got some very wrong bits in is sort of a less   less easy thing to do 
 none 	right 
 none 	some errors  yeah 
 none 	i don t know  i do  i don t know the answer to that 
 none 	i m sure the professional transcribers obviously don t have any use for  
 none 	i don t know 
 none 	yeah
 none 	well  i mean there s this cyber transcriber service  right 
 none 	yeah  that s true  that s true 
 none 	and at least supposedly the way they work is by feeding them what is the output of the recognizer 
 none 	yeah  by fixing up transcripts 
 none 	so maybe it depends on what the software tools are like 
 none 	if it s   you know  if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing  or do you point  or i don t know 
 none 	yeah  but   yeah 
 none 	there s supposed to be some out   out   out of work shepherders or something in scotland but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	ah  the internet 
 none 	they should all be in india right now  that s where the good  but the cheap english speakers are 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	inexpensive 
 none 	not in scotland 
 none 	i m sorry  yeah 
 none 	not in scotland 
 none 	well they don t speak such clear english
 none 	they   they sheep   they s  they   they speak cheap english  right 
 none 	o_k so we re degenerating  right  are   are   are we done with uh m_r business  or    
 none 	yep 
 none 	sure 
 open_agenda 	i mean what  what s   maybe we should   what are our action items   so there s   there s the continuing process of cleaning up the stuff and making it easier to do that 
 create_single_reminder 	there s  taking the results of this meeting and putting it in some kind of decent form  probably getting some kind of single channel merged sum data or something so that you can give a simple sound file of some sort to a transcriber to deal with it rather than this massive thing    that s a little bit of stuff to do  right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 create_single_reminder 	and then  do some segmenting and recognition   initial recognition would be interesting to do   
 none 	yeah  although it   it   it   it may be separating out these numbers from the rest  yeah 
 none 	that s what i mean 
 none 	and then
 create_single_reminder 	yeah  just doing a digits on it   uh  connected digits   
 none 	yeah and uh
 none 	right 
 none 	so  with this next  
 none 	you wanna read 
 none 	sure  o_k 
 none 	so this is transcript three  this is morgan with the wireless lapel  two four one three five five six eight six eight eight seven eight eight six eight nine zero eight
 none 	o_ one three five two two nine
 none 	this is adam on uh wireless headset number two with transcript number five  three four o_ six five two six seven four eight five four nine
 none 	o_ zero one zero eight eight five three three seven one
 none 	this is dan and this is transcript number four  three nine four seven one eight five six seven zero four six nine eight nine nine two three
 none 	o_ six five zero four four three six five nine one nine five two
 none 	how many more you got 
 none 	oh i on  i did ten but i can   i have a script to generate them automatically 
 none 	well  let s do some more while we got them here 
 none 	wow 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	what fun it is 
 none 	well  you know  it s not  but
 none 	it s interesting that um it m  it s not clear whether it s better to have them written as   as words or   or figures 
 none 	but  of course  to get zero and  o_ s distinguished we   you have to do it 
 none 	that s why  yep 
 none 	but it s kind of weird to read 
 none 	o_k  this is uh morgan again with the wireless lapel  transcript six  four five five five five zero nine seven one six nine one four o_ seven eight nine o_ four five three five eight zero two one five nine one three two eight zero five three five five three six
 none 	this is adam on the wireless headset  transcript eight  five five two zero six seven o_ o_ seven six eight nine eight nine
 none 	o_ zero two two eight two o_ three four eight four seven zero
 none 	and this is dan with transcript number seven  four five six four four five six o_ six o_ two eight one two o_ eight five nine nine three five o_ three two four
 none 	o_ zero one two o_ six two three
 none 	yeah  there s just two more  uh
 none 	go ahead 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so 
 none 	thanks 
 none 	o_k  go ahead and read it and then fill it out 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  uh this is morgan again with the wireless lapel  transcript nine  five seven three five three seven nine six nine seven eight zero
 none 	o_ two seven four o_ zero two three one nine zero nine one three o_ two eight nine o_ two eight three five four
 none 	and this is dan with transcript ten  five seven one one eight five o_ one six four six nine eight seven zero
 none 	o_ zero one two four one o_ four o_ five three four nine nine six o_
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i d say we re done 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh  i wonder   i wonder if we ran out of disk space yet 
 none 	so  is it   it s going to disk  or is this  
 none 	and how   how much disk do we have 
 none 	so 
 none 	o_k   doesn t look like it crashed  that s great 
 none 	so i think maybe what s causing it to crash is i keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it s working  and so i think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash 
 none 	so  i won t do that anymore 
 none 	and it looks like you ve found a way of uh mapping the location to the   without having people have to give their names each time 
 none 	sounds like an initialization thing 
 none 	i mean it s like you have the   so you know that  
 none 	no 
 none 	i mean  are you going to write down that i sat here 
 none 	i m gonna collect the digit forms and write it down 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	so    so they should be right with what s on the digit forms 
 none 	o_k  so i ll go ahead and start with digits 
 none 	um  reading transcript one two five one dash one two seven zero  u  seven five three nine one two zero one two seven three o_ four five two six nine six three nine three zero six four seven eight two o_ o_ six three o_ nine
 none 	o_ zero two two nine three four nine five o_ four five five four six seven eight
 none 	o_ four two two zero two one 
 none 	and i should say that uh  you just pau  you just read each line an  and then pause briefly 
 none 	and start by giving the transcript number 
 none 	o_k  transcript number one one nine one dash one two one zero  eight zero one one

 none 	o_ three seven eight 
 none 	so uh  you see  don  the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project  it s just uh  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	umh 
 none 	uh  you know  it doesn t seem like a bad idea to have that information 
 none 	and i m surprised i sort of   i m surprised i forgot that  but uh i think that would be a good thing to add 
 none 	yeah  i   i d   i think it s some 
 none 	after i just printed out a zillion of them 
 none 	yeah  well  that s  
 none 	um  so i   i do have a   a  an agenda suggestion 
 none 	uh  we   i think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um i was thinking
 none 	i think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we   we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that s easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that andreas had to leave 
 none 	so uh i m suggesting we turn it around and   and uh sort of we have   anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later  uh hold them for a bit  and let s talk about the   the research y kind of things 
 none 	um  so um the one th  one thing i know that we have on that is uh we had talked a   a couple weeks before um uh about the uh   the stuff you were doing with   with uh um uh l  l  attempting to locate events  we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by   events   but
 none 	i think  you know  what we had meant by  events  i guess was uh points of overlap between speakers 
 none 	but i th  i gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else like some other noise 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yes 
 none 	uh huh  yeah 
 none 	you mean that as an event also 
 none 	so at any rate you were   you ve   you ve done some work on that and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we re thinking about doing 
 none 	to  right 
 none 	um  i think especially since you   you haven t been in   in these meetings for a little bit  maybe you have some discussion of some of the p  the plausible things to look at now that we re starting to get data  uh and one of the things i know that also came up uh is some discussions that   that uh   that uh jane had with lokendra uh about some   some   some um uh work about
 none 	i   i   i d  i   i don t want to try to say cuz i  
 none 	i ll say it wrong  but anyway some   some potential collaboration there about   about the   about the   working with these data 
 none 	oh  sure 
 none 	so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  uh 
 none 	you wanna just go around 
 none 	uh  well  i don t know if we   if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing  i think there s just just a couple   a couple people primarily um but um
 none 	uh  wh  why don t  
 none 	actually i think that   that last one i just said we could do fairly quickly so why don t you   you start with that 
 none 	o_k  shall i   shall i just start  o_k 
 none 	yeah  just explain what it was 
 none 	um  so  uh  he was interested in the question of   you know  relating to his   to the research he presented recently  um of inference structures  and uh  the need to build in  um 
 none 	this   this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language  and he gave the example in his talk about how um  e  a  i m remembering it just off the top of my head right now  but it s something about how um  i   joe slipped  you know   john had washed the floor  or something like that 
 none 	and i don t have it quite right  but that kind of thing  where you have to draw the inference that  o_k  there s this time sequence  but also the   the   the causal aspects of the uh floor and   and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it   these sorts of things  so 
 none 	i looked through the transcript that we have so far  and um  fou  identified a couple different types of things of that type and um  one of them was something like uh  during the course of the transcript  um um  w  we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on  and um  the question was raised
 none 	 well  should we restart the recording at this point  
 none 	and   and dan ellis said   well  we re just so far ahead of the game right now we really don t need to  
 none 	now  how would you interpret that without a lot of inference  so  the inferences that are involved are things like  o_k  so  how do you interpret  ahead of the game  
 none 	you know 
 none 	so it s the   it s i 
 none 	hmm  metaphorically 
 none 	what you   what you int  what you draw   you know  the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording  that um  i  that i  we have enough space  and he continues  like  we re so ahead of the game cuz now we have built in downsampling  
 none 	so you have to sort of get the idea that um   ahead of the game  is sp  speaking with respect to space limitations  that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space  and that therefore we can keep the recording we ve done so far 
 none 	but there are a lot of different things like that 
 none 	so  do you think his interest is in using this as a data source  or training material  or what 
 none 	well  i   i should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that i had with him  so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours and um uh i thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data  uh and um such things might be useful for that in or  before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh  with jane s help  look into some of the data that we re   already have and see  is there anything to this at all 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	is there any point which you think that  you know  you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it  cuz it could be that you d look through it and you say  well  this is just the wrong task for   for him to pursue his   
 none 	wrong  yeah 
 none 	and   and uh i got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that   that you looked at that   that it s plausible at least 
 none 	it s possible  uh  he was   he   he   you know   we met and he was gonna go and uh you know  y  look through them more systematically and then uh meet again  so it s  you know  not a matter of a  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  yeah  i think  
 none 	i think it was optimistic 
 none 	so anyway  that s   that s e  a quite different thing from anything we ve talked about that  you know  might   might   might come out from some of this 
 none 	but he can use text  basically 
 none 	i mean  he s talking about just using text pretty much  or    
 none 	that s his major  
 none 	i mentioned several that w  had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours and that wasn t as directly relevant to what he s doing 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	he s interested in these   these knowledge structures  inferences that you draw i  from  
 none 	yeah  interesting 
 none 	i mean  he certainly could use text  but we were in fact looking to see if there   is there   is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in   in   in this stuff  so 
 none 	and i imagine that transcripts of speech   i mean text that is speech   probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing  i   i don t know whether it would or not  but it seems like it would 
 none 	i don t know  probably de  probably depends on what the prepared writing was  but 
 none 	yeah  i don t think i would make that leap  because i  in narratives  you know   i mean  if you spell out everything in a narrative  it can be really tedious  so 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  i m just thinking  you know  when you re   when you re face to face  you have a lot of backchannel and  
 none 	oh  that aspect 
 none 	and  
 none 	yeah  and so i think it s just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it s face to face 
 none 	well  
 none 	i mean  so  if i just read that dan was saying  we re ahead of the game  in that   in that context 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else 
 none 	i   you know  i   i had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn t one of them  this   this one really does um m  make you leap from   so he said  you know   we re ahead of the game  w  we have built in downsampling  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and the inference  i  if you had it written down  would be  
 none 	i guess it would be the same 
 none 	uh huh  but there are others that have backchanneling  it s just he was less interested in those 
 none 	can i  
 none 	sorry to interrupt  um 
 none 	i f  f  f  i ve    d 
 none 	a minute   uh  several minutes ago  i  like  briefly was   was not listening and  
 none 	so who is   he   in this context 
 none 	yeah  there s a lot of pronoun  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so i was just realizing we ve   you guys have been talking about  he  um for at least uh  i don t know  three   three four minutes without ever mentioning the person s name again 
 none 	i believe it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so this is   this is   this is   gonna be a big  big problem if you want to later do uh  you know  indexing  or speech understanding of any sort 
 none 	actually to make it worse  uh  morgan uses  you  and  you  with gaze and no identification  or  
 none 	it s in my notes 
 none 	i just wrote this down  yeah  actually  cuz morgan will say well    you had some ideas  and he never said li  he looked  
 none 	you just wrote this 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  i think he s doing that intentionally  aren t you 
 none 	right  so it s great  so this is really great because the thing is  because he s looking at the per  even for addressees in the conversation  i bet you could pick that up in the acoustics  just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh huh  could be  yeah  that would be tou 
 none 	can we 
 none 	oh  that would be interesting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  so that  i mean  to even know um when  
 none 	yeah  if you have the p_z_ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice 
 none 	well  especially with morgan  with the way we have the microphones arranged  i m sort of right on axis and it would be very hard to tell 
 none 	right  put morgan always like this and  
 none 	uh 
 none 	oh  but you d have the  
 none 	you d have fainter   wouldn t you get fainter reception out here 
 none 	well  these  
 none 	sure  but i think if i m talking like this 
 none 	right now i m looking at jane and talking  now i m looking at chuck and talking  i don t think the microphones would pick up that difference 
 none 	but you don t have this   this problem  morgan is the one who does this most 
 none 	i see 
 none 	so if i m talking at you  or i m talking at you 
 none 	i probably been affect  no  i th  i think i ve been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about   and concerns about  oh gee is somebody going to say something bad   and so on 
 none 	lawyers 
 none 	and so i   so i m   i m tending to stay away from people s names even though uh  
 none 	i am too 
 none 	even though you could pick up later on  just from the acoustics who you were t  who you were looking at 
 none 	i am too 
 none 	and we did mention who  he  was 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	early in the conversation 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  but i missed it  but   it was uh  
 none 	do   sh  can i say or   or is that just too sensitive 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	yeah  yeah  no no  there s   no no  it isn t sensitive at all  i was just  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  
 none 	i was just   i was overreacting just because we ve been talking about it  it s o_k to  
 none 	and in fact  it is   it is   it is sensitive  i   i came up with something from the human subjects people that i wanted to mention  i mean  it fits into the m  area of the mundane  but they did say  
 none 	no  but that   it s interesting 
 none 	you know  i asked her very specifically about this clause of how  um  you know  it says  no individuals will be identified uh   in any publication using the data   o_k  well  individuals being identified  let s say you have a   a snippet that says 
 none 	 joe s  uh thinks such and such about   about this field  but i think he s wrongheaded  
 none 	now i mean  we re   we re gonna be careful not to have the   wrongheaded   part in there  but   but you know  let s say we say  you know   joe used to think so and so about this area  in his publication he says that but i think he s changed his mind   or whatever 
 none 	b  but i  
 none 	then the issue of   of being able to trace joe  because we know he s well known in this field  and all this and   and tie it to the speaker  whose name was just mentioned a moment ago  can be sensitive  so i think it s really   really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there s a slanderous aspect to it  then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove 
 none 	yeah  well  there s that 
 none 	but i   i mean i think also to some extent it s just educating the human subjects people  in a way  because there s  
 none 	if uh   you know  there s court transcripts  there s   there s transcripts of radio shows   i mean people say people s names all the time 
 none 	so i think it   it can t be bad to say people s names 
 none 	it s just that   i  i mean you re right that there s more poten  if we never say anybody s name  then there s no chance of   of   of slandering anybody  but  
 none 	but  then it won t   i mean  if we   if we   yeah  i mean we should do whatever s natural in a meeting if   if we weren t being recorded 
 none 	it s not a meeting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  so i   so my behavior is probably not natural  so 
 none 	 if person x_   
 none 	well  my feeling on it was that it wasn t really important who said it  you know 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  if you ha  since you have to um go over the transcripts later anyway  you could make it one of the jobs of the people who do that to mark u 
 none 	well  we t  we t  we talked about this during the anon  anonymization  if we wanna go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name 
 none 	right 
 none 	and i thought that our conclusion was that we didn t want to do that 
 none 	yeah  we really can t  but a  actually  i m sorry  i really would like to push   finish this off  so it s  
 none 	i understand  no i just   i just was suggesting that it s not a bad policy p  potentially  so  we need to talk about this later 
 none 	yeah  i di  i didn t intend it an a policy though 
 none 	it was   it was just it was just unconscious   well  semi conscious behavior  i sorta knew i was doing it but it was  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	well  i still don t know who  he  is 
 none 	no  you have to say  you still don t know who   he   is  with that prosody 
 none 	i   i do  i don t remember who  he  is 
 none 	ah  uh  we were talking about dan at one point and we were talking about lokendra at another point  and i don t   i don t remember which   which part 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah  depends on which one you mean 
 none 	it s ambiguous  so it s o_k 
 none 	uh  i think  
 none 	well  the inference structures was lokendra 
 none 	but no  the inference stuff was   was   was lokendra  o_k  that makes sense  yeah 
 none 	yeah  yeah  yeah 
 none 	and the downsampling must have been dan 
 none 	um  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	good   yeah  yeah  you could do all these inferences  yeah 
 none 	it s an inference 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  i   i would like to move it into   into uh what jose uh has been doing because he s actually been doing something  so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	o_k  well 
 none 	as opposed to the rest of us 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k  i   i remind that me   my first objective eh  in the project is to   to study difference parameters to   to find a   a good solution to detect eh  the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded 
 none 	but eh  tsk  ehhh
 none 	in that way i  
 none 	i  
 none 	i begin to   to study and to analyze the ehn   the recorded speech eh the different session to   to find and to locate and to mark eh the   the different overlapping zone 
 none 	and eh so eh i was eh   i am transcribing the   the first session and i   i have found eh  eh one thousand acoustic events  eh besides the overlapping zones  eh i   i   i mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh  eh  talk eh  eh  clap  eh  
 none 	i don t know what is the different names eh you use to   to name the   the n  speech
 none 	nonspeech sounds 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  i don t think we ve been doing it at that level of detail 
 none 	so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	eh  i   i   i do  i don t need to   to   to mmm   to m  to label the   the different acoustic  but i prefer because eh
 none 	i would like to   to study if eh  i  
 none 	i will find eh  eh  a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping i would like to   to   to test these parameters eh with the   another eh  eh acoustic events  to nnn   to eh   to find what is the ehm   the false   eh  the false eh hypothesis eh  nnn  which eh are produced when we use the   the ehm   this eh parameter   eh i mean pitch eh  eh  difference eh  feature  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	you know  
 none 	so it was  
 none 	i think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there s two there 
 none 	umh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  if it s a tapping sound  you wouldn t necessarily   or  you know  something like that  it d be   it might be hard to know that it was two separate events 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  
 none 	you weren t talking about just overlaps were you  you were just talking about acoustic events 
 none 	ye 
 none 	i   i   i   i t  i t 
 none 	someone starts  someone stops  
 none 	i talk eh about eh acoustic events in general  but eh my   my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	eh  n 
 none 	how many overlaps were there uh in it 
 none 	eh in twelve minutes i found eh  eh one thousand acoustic events 
 none 	no no  how many of them were the overlaps of speech  though 
 none 	how many  eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session in five   eh in forty five minutes 
 none 	oh  god 
 none 	ugh 
 none 	three hundred overlapping speech  
 none 	alm  three hundred overlapping zone 
 none 	overlapping speech 
 none 	with the overlapping zone  overlapping speech   speech what eh different duration 
 none 	sure 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	does this     so if you had an overlap involving three people  how many times was that counted 
 none 	yeah  three people  two people  eh  um i would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background  be 
 none 	no no  but i think what she s asking is if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking  instead of two  did you call that one event 
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i consider one event eh for th  for that eh for all the zone 
 none 	this   th 
 none 	well  
 none 	i   i   i con  i consider   i consider eh an acoustic event  the overlapping zone  the period where three speaker or eh   are talking together 
 none 	so let s  
 none 	for 
 none 	umh 
 none 	so let s say me and jane are talking at the same time  and then liz starts talking also over all of us  how many events would that be 
 none 	so  i don t understand 
 none 	so  two people are talking  and then a third person starts talking  is there an event right here 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	eh no 
 none 	no no 
 none 	for me is the overlapping zone  because   because you   you have s  you have more one   eh  more one voice eh  eh produced in a   in   in a moment 
 none 	so i  if two or more people are talking 
 none 	i see 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  so i think   yeah  we just wanted to understand how you re defining it  so then  in the region between   since there   there is some continuous region  in between regions where there is only one person speaking  and one contiguous region like that you re calling an event 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	if 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	uh huh  yeah 
 none 	is it   are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event  or are you calling the entire length of it the event 
 none 	i consider the   the  nnn   the nnn  nnn   eh  the entirety eh  eh  all   all the time there were   the voice has overlapped 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	this is the idea 
 none 	but eh i   i don t distinguish between the   the numbers of eh speaker 
 none 	uh  i m not considering eh the   the   ehm eh  the fact of eh  eh  for example  what did you say 
 none 	eh at first eh  eh two talkers are uh  eh speaking  and eh  eh a third person eh join to   to that 
 none 	for me  it s eh   it s eh  all overlap zone  with eh several numbers of speakers is eh  eh the same acoustic event 
 none 	wi  but   uh  without any mark between the zone   of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together  and the zone with the three speakers  it  
 none 	that would j  just be one 
 none 	one  one 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	eh  with eh  a beginning mark and the ending mark 
 none 	got it 
 none 	because eh for me  is the   is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral  i don t mind   by the moment  by the moment  i   i don t  
 none 	well  but  
 none 	but you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two  so 
 none 	yeah  but eh   but eh i have to study 
 none 	could 
 none 	you had to start somewhere 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what will happen in a general way  i  
 none 	we just w 
 none 	so there s a lot of overlap  so 
 none 	yep 
 none 	i don t know what eh will   will happen with the  
 none 	that s a lot of overlap  yeah  for forty five minutes 
 none 	so again  that s   that s three   three hundred in forty five minutes that are   that are speakers  just speakers 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but a   a   a th 
 none 	uh  huh  o_k  yeah  so that s about eight per minute 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  but  
 none 	but a thousand events in twelve minutes  that s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh 
 none 	but that can include taps 
 none 	but  
 none 	well  but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l  in twelve minutes is a lot 
 none 	general 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	actually  
 none 	i   i con  i consider  
 none 	i consider acoustic events eh  the silent too 
 none 	silent 
 none 	silence starting or silence ending  
 none 	yeah  silent  ground to   bec  to detect   eh because i consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	oh 
 none 	in ge  in   in   in a general point of view  in the per 
 none 	oh 
 none 	o_k  so how many of those thousand were silence 
 none 	not speech   not speech or too much speech 
 none 	alright 
 none 	too much speech 
 none 	right 
 none 	so how many of those thousand were silence  silent sections 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh silent  i   i   i  
 none 	i don t   i   i haven t the   eh i   i would like to   to do a stylistic study and give you eh with the report eh from eh the   the study from the   the   the session   one session 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and i   i found that eh another thing 
 none 	when eh eh i w  i  
 none 	i was eh look at eh nnn  the difference speech file  um  for example  eh if eh we use the ehm   the mixed file  to   to transcribe  the   the events and the words 
 none 	i   i saw that eh the eh speech signal  collected by the eh this kind of mike   eh of this kind of mike  eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh  we eh   collected by headphone  and  
 none 	yep 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s right  but the problem is the following 
 none 	the   the   the  
 none 	i   i   i knew that eh the signal eh  eh would be different  but eh the   the problem is eh  eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by   by that mike uh qui  compared with the mixed file 
 none 	well  
 none 	and so if   when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn   the mixed file  it s possible   eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system  it s possible you eh   in the eh i  and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike  to eh   to nnn   to do the experiments with the   the system  its possible to evaluate eh  eh   or to consider eh acoustic events that   which you marked eh in the mixed file  but eh they don t appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the   by the mike 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	the   the reason that i generated the mixed file was for
 none 	i_b_m to do word level transcription  not speech event transcription 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  oh  it s a good idea  it s a good idea i think 
 none 	so i agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription  that the mixed signals here   i mean  if i m tapping on the table  you  it s not gonna show up on any of the mikes  but it s gonna show up rather loudly in the p_z_m  so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so and i   i  
 none 	i say eh that eh  eh  or this eh only because eh i c  i   i   in my opinion  it s necessary to eh   to eh   to put the transcription on the speech file  collected by the objective signal 
 none 	i mean the   the   the signal collected by the   eh  the real mike in the future  in the prototype to   to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech you have to   to analyze   you have to   to process 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	the   the   the far field  yeah 
 none 	because i   i found a difference 
 none 	yeah  well  just   i mean  just in that   that one s  ten second  or whatever it was  example that adam had that   that we   we passed on to others a few months ago  there was that business where i g  i guess it was adam and jane were talking at the same time and   and uh  in the close talking mikes you couldn t hear the overlap  and in the distant mike you could  so yeah  it s clear that if you wanna study   if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap  it s probably better to use a distant mike  on the other hand  there s other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close talking mikes  so it s  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	that s good 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but why can t you use the combination of the close talking mikes  time aligned 
 none 	if you use the combination of the close talking mikes  you would hear jane interrupting me  but you wouldn t hear the paper rustling 
 none 	and so if you re interested in  
 none 	were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you 
 none 	some of it s masking   masked 
 none 	i   i mean if you re interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech  that s not a problem  right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	although the other issue is that the mixed close talking mikes   i mean  i m doing weird normalizations and things like that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but it s known  i mean  the normalization you do is over the whole conversation isn t it  over the whole meeting 
 none 	yep 
 none 	right 
 none 	yep 
 none 	so if you wanted to study people overlapping people  that s not a problem 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	i   i   i think eh   i saw the nnn   the   eh but eh i eh   i have eh any results 
 none 	i   i   i saw the   the speech file collected by eh the fet mike  and eh eh signal eh to eh   to noise eh relation is eh low 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	it s low  it s very low  you would comp  if we compare it with eh the headphone  and
 none 	yep 
 none 	i   i found that nnn   that eh  ehm  pr  probably 
 none 	did   did you k 
 none 	i m not sure eh by the moment  but it s   it s probably that eh a lot of eh  eh for example  in the overlapping zone  on eh   in   in several eh parts of the files where you   you can find eh  eh eh  smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the   in the meeting  it s probably in   in that eh   in   in those files you   you can not find   you can not process because eh it s confused with   with noise 
 none 	mm hmm  mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and there are a lot of   i think  but i have to study with more detail 
 none 	but eh my idea is to   to process only nnn  this eh   nnn  this kind of s  of eh speech 
 none 	because i think it s more realistic  i m not sure it s a good idea  but eh  
 none 	no   i 
 none 	well  it s more realistic but it ll   it ll be a lot harder 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  it d be hard  but on the other hand as you point out  if your   if i  if   if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people   people s speech  you will   you will get that somewhat better  um 
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	are you making any use   uh you were   you were working with th  the data that had already been transcribed 
 none 	with   by jane 
 none 	does it uh  
 none 	yes  now um did you make any use of that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	see i was wondering cuz we st  we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed  do you  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the   the transcription by jane  t  eh i  eh 
 none 	i   i   i want to use to   to nnn  eh to put   i  i  it s a reference for me 
 none 	but eh the transcription   eh for example  i   i don t   i   i m not interested in the   in the   in the words  transcription words  eh transcribed eh eh in   eh follow in the   in the   in the speech file  but eh eh jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker  in the   in the meeting  um eh she   she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh   there is an overlapping zone 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but eh there isn t any   any mark  time   temporal mark  to   to c  eh   to mmm   e heh  to label the beginning and the end of the   of the ta 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	right  so she is  
 none 	i m   i   i   i think eh we need this information to nnn  
 none 	right 
 none 	so the twelve   you   you   it took you twelve hours   of course this included maybe some   some time where you were learning about what   what you wanted to do  but   but uh  it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty five minutes  your s 
 none 	twelve minutes 
 none 	twelve minutes 
 none 	twelve minutes 
 none 	twelve minutes  twelve 
 none 	i thought you did forty five minutes of  
 none 	no  forty five minutes is the   is the session  all the session 
 none 	oh  you haven t done the whole session  this is just twelve minutes  oh 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah  all is the the session 
 none 	tw  twelve hours of work to   to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part   of f 
 none 	so let me back up again  so the   when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps  that s in twelve minutes 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	no no no  i   i consider all the   all the session because eh i   i count the nnn   the nnn   the overlappings marked by   by jane  in   in   in   in the fin  in   in the forty five minutes 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	o_k  
 none 	oh  i see 
 none 	so it s three hundred in forty five minutes  but you have   you have time uh  uh marked   twelve minute   the   the   the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it  got it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  not just the overlaps  everything 
 none 	so  can i ask   can i ask whether you found   uh  you know  how accurate uh jane s uh uh labels were as far as   you know  did she miss some overlaps  or did she n   
 none 	but  by   by the moment  i   i don t compare  my   my temporal mark with eh jane  but eh
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i   i want to do it 
 none 	because eh eh i  per  perhaps
 none 	i have eh errors in the   in the marks 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i   and if i   i compare with eh jane  it s probably
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  
 none 	i   i   i can correct and   and   and   to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file 
 none 	i 
 none 	well  also jane   jane was doing word level 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so we weren t concerned with exactly when an overlap started and stopped 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  right  i m expect  i m not expecting  
 none 	well  
 none 	well  not only a word level  but actually i mean  you didn t need to show the exact point of interruption  you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt  or  
 none 	no  it s  
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yep 
 none 	well  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  yeah  b  yeah  i would say time bin  so my   my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin  beginning and end point  and   and sometimes  you know  it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle  but  yeah  w  it just wasn t important for our purposes to have it that   i  disrupt that unit in order to have  you know  a  the words in the order in which they were spoken  it would have   it would have been hard with the interface that we have  now  my   a  adam s working on a of course  on a revised overlapping interface  but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	uh huh  i   i   i think  
 none 	it s   it s a good eh work  but eh i think we need eh eh more information 
 none 	no  of course  i expect you to find more overlaps than   than jane because you re looking at it at a much more detailed level 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	always need more for  
 none 	no  no  i   i have to go to   i want eh   i wanted to eh compare the   the transcription 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i have  
 none 	but if it takes sixty to one  
 none 	well  i  but i have a suggestion about that  um  obviously this is very  very time consuming  and you re finding lots of things which i m sure are gonna be very interesting  but in the interests of making progress  uh might i s  how   how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps 
 none 	only 
 none 	yes  do not mark any other events  but only mark speaker   do you think that would speed it up quite a bit 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	do y  do you think that would speed it up 
 none 	uh  speed up your   your   your marking 
 none 	i   i   i   i w 
 none 	i   i wanted to   nnn  i don t understand very 
 none 	it took you a long time to mark twelve minutes  now  my suggestion was for the other thirty three  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  yeah  yeah 
 none 	on  only to mark   only to mark overlapping zone  but  
 none 	yeah  and my question is  if you did that  if you followed my suggestion  would it take much less time 
 none 	oh  yeah  sure  yeah sure  sure sure  sure  because i   i need a lot of time to   to put the label or to do that  yeah 
 none 	yeah o_k  then i think it s a good idea  then i think it s a good idea  because it 
 none 	yeah  i mean  we  we know that there s noise 
 none 	and 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	there s   there s uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth  and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth and   and something in between with paper rustling 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we know that all that s there and it s a g  worthwhile thing to study  but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	whereas th  i  i would think that uh you   we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking 
 none 	uh huh  o_k  o_k 
 none 	so 
 none 	then you can get the   cuz you need   if it s three hundred uh   i  i  it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and   and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of   of what s going on  much less any kind of reasonable statistics 
 none 	right 
 none 	now  why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the   i mean  you shouldn t need to do this p  completely by hand  right 
 none 	well  that s  
 none 	that s what i was gonna bring up 
 none 	um  o_k  yeah  so let s back up because you weren t here for an earlier conversation 
 none 	i m sorry 
 none 	so the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy  such as the energy in the l_p_c residuals  such as   i mean there s a bunch of things  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i mean  increased energy is  is sort of an obvious one  yeah  um  and uh  it s not obvious  i mean  you could   you could do the dumbest thing and get   get it ninety percent of the time  but when you start going past that and trying to do better  it s not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the   you know  the right detector  so the idea is to have some ground truth first 
 none 	in the far field mike 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	and so the i  the idea of the manual marking was to say  o_k this  i  you know  it s   it s really here  
 none 	but i think liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts 
 none 	what i mean is get it from the close talking mikes 
 none 	uh  yeah  we t  we t  w  we t  we talked about that 
 none 	a  or ge  get a first pass from those  and then go through sort of   it d be a lot faster probably to  
 none 	and you can  
 none 	yeah  that s his  uh  
 none 	we   we   we talked about that  s  but so it s a bootstrapping thing and the thing is  the idea was  i  we i  i  we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway  and   and then whatever he could mark would be helpful  and we could  
 none 	yeah  i just  
 none 	right 
 none 	uh it s a question of what you bootstrap from  you know  do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g  do better  or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then   then do your simple measurements  uh from the close talking mike 
 none 	i mean  even with the close talking mike you re not gonna get it right all the time 
 none 	well  that s what i wonder  because um   or how bad it is  be  um  because that would be interesting especially because the bottleneck is the transcription  right 
 none 	well 
 none 	i m working on a program to do that  and  
 none 	i mean  we ve got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for  we have the audio data  we have the close talking mike  so i mean it seems like one kind of project that s not perfect  but   um  that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is  you know  if you infer form the close talking mikes where the on off points are of speech  you know  how can we detect that from a far field 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  we discussed that 
 none 	and  
 none 	oh 
 none 	i ve   i ve written a program to do that  and it  uh   and   so   but it s   it s doing something very  very simple  it just takes a threshold  based on   on the volume 
 none 	o_k  i m sorry i missed the  
 none 	it s o_k 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand  yeah 
 none 	right  by hand  yeah 
 none 	um  and then it does a median filter  and then it looks for runs 
 none 	and  it seems to work  i ve   i m sort of fiddling with the parameters  to get it to actually generate something  and i haven t   i don t   what i m working on   was working on   was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have  into transcriber 
 none 	and so   i told   i said it would take about a day  i ve worked on it for about half a day  so give me another half day and i  we ll have something we can play with 
 none 	i have to go 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	see  this is where we really need the meeting recorder query stuff to be working  because we ve had these meetings and we ve had this discussion about this  and i m sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided  but i couldn t remember all of it  so 
 none 	right  i m sorry  i just  
 none 	it 
 none 	but  
 none 	i think it was partly that  you know  give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like  partly that we have e  some ground truth to compare against  you know  when   when he   he gets his thing going  uh  and  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well  it s definitely good to have somebody look at it  i was just thinking as a way to speed up you know  the amount of  
 none 	that was   that was exactly the notion that   that   that we discussed  so 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	thanks 
 none 	another thing we discussed was um that  
 none 	it looks good 
 none 	i have to go 
 none 	i ll be in touch  thanks 
 none 	s  see ya 
 none 	just give me an email 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	was that um there m  there was this already a script i believe uh that dan had written  that uh handle bleedthrough  i mean cuz you have this   this close   you have contamination from other people who speak loudly 
 none 	yeah  and i haven t tried using that  it would probably help the program that i m doing to first feed it through that 
 none 	it s a cross correlation filter 
 none 	so i   i haven t tried that  but that   if   it   it might be something   it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little 
 none 	so  some thought of maybe having  
 none 	yeah  having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours 
 none 	exactly 
 none 	but   but that s a refinement and i think we wanna see   try the simple thing first  cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y  y  yo  you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first 
 none 	yep 
 none 	that s what we were discussing 
 none 	yep 
 none 	but uh  having   having somebody have some experience  again  with   with uh   with marking it from a human standpoint  we re   i mean  i don t expect jose to   to do it for uh f  fifty hours of   of speech  but i mean we   if uh   if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it  say  for forty five minutes  then at least we d have three hundred examples of it  and when   when uh adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	sure 
 none 	sure 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh yeah  definitely 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you know  i did   i did uh something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs  and it works pretty well  i mean  i  almost exactly what you described  an energy detector with a median filter  you look for runs 
 none 	and uh  you know  you can  
 none 	it seemed like the right thing to do 
 none 	yeah  i mean  you   you can get y  i mean  you get them pretty close 
 none 	that was with zero literature search 
 none 	and so i think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to   to do it  yeah 
 none 	that s good validation 
 none 	is this proprietary 
 none 	yeah  do you have a patent on it 
 none 	uh 
 none 	no  no 
 none 	it was when i was working for the government 
 none 	oh  then everybody owns it  it s the people 
 none 	well  i mean  is this something that we could just co opt  or is it     no  o_k 
 none 	nah 
 none 	well  i  i  i  he s pretty close  anyway  i think   i think it s  
 none 	yeah  he s   it   it doesn t take a long time 
 none 	right 
 none 	just output 
 none 	i just thought if it was tried and true  then   and he s gone through additional levels of   of development 
 none 	although if you   if you have some parameters like what s a good window size for the median filter  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  i have to remember  i ll think about it  and try to remember 
 none 	and it might be different for government people 
 none 	that s alright  
 none 	yeah  good enough for government work  as they say 
 none 	they   they  
 none 	di  dif  different   different bandwidth 
 none 	they d 
 none 	i was doing pretty short  you know  tenth of a second  sorts of numbers 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh 
 none 	i don t know  it   if   if we want to uh  
 none 	so  uh  maybe we should move on to other   other things in limited time 
 none 	can i ask one question about his statistics  so   so in the tw  twelve minutes  um  if we took three hundred and divided it by four  which is about the length of twelve minutes  i 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  i d expect like there should be seventy five overlaps  did you find uh more than seventy five overlaps in that period  or    
 none 	more than 
 none 	more than   how many overlaps in your twelve minutes 
 none 	how many  eh  not  i 
 none 	onl  only i   i transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the but eh i   i don t co  eh   i don t count eh the   the overlap 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the overlaps  o_k 
 none 	i consider i   i   the   the nnn  
 none 	the   the three hundred is eh considered only you   your transcription 
 none 	i have to   to finish transcribing 
 none 	so 
 none 	i b  i bet they re more  because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than   than sort of the middle 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	middle or end 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	because i  we re   we re dealing with the   uh  in the early meetings  we re recording while we re saying who s talking on what microphone  and things like that  and that seems to be a lot of overlap 
 none 	i m not sure 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think it s an empirical question  i think we could find that out  i m   i m not sure that the beginning had more 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	so   so i was gonna ask  i guess about any   any other things that   that   that either of you wanted to talk about  especially since
 none 	andreas is leaving in five minutes  that   that you wanna go with 
 none 	can i just ask about the data  like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data  just cuz i m  
 none 	i wanted to get a feel for that to sort of be able to know what   what can be done first and like how many meetings are we recording and  
 none 	right so there s this   this  
 none 	there s this forty five minute piece that jane transcribed 
 none 	that piece was then uh sent to i_b_m so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point 
 none 	then there s s  a larger piece that s been recorded and uh put on c_d rom and sent uh to i_b_m 
 none 	right  and then we don t know 
 none 	how many meetings is that  like   how many   t  ten   it s like ten meetings or something 
 none 	what s that 
 none 	that was about ten hours  and there was about  
 none 	yeah  something like that  and then   then we r 
 none 	uh huh  o_k 
 none 	ten meetings that have been sent to i_b_m 
 none 	and  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  i haven t sent them yet because i was having this problem with the missing files 
 none 	oh 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh  that s right  that had   those have not been sent 
 none 	h  how many total have we recorded now  altogether 
 none 	we re saying about twelve hours 
 none 	about twelve by now  twelve or thirteen 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	and we re recording only this meeting  like continuously we re only recording this one now  or     o_k 
 none 	no 
 none 	nope 
 none 	no  so the   the   that s the   that s the biggest one   uh  chunk so far  but there s at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys 
 none 	it was the morning one 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	jerry 
 none 	do they meet every week  or every  
 none 	and then there  
 none 	uh  they do  w  w  and we talked to them about recording some more and we re going to  uh  we ve started having a morning meeting  today uh i  starting a w  a week or two ago  on the uh front end issues  and we re recording those  uh there s a network services and applications group here who s agreed to have their meetings recorded  and we re gonna start recording them  they re   they meet on tuesdays  we re gonna start recording them next week 
 none 	great 
 none 	so actually  we re gonna h  start having a   a pretty significant chunk and so  you know  adam s sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy  and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff   things like that  now that uh   the things are starting to happen 
 none 	so right now  yeah  i th  i d say the data is predominantly meeting meetings  but there are scattered other meetings in it and that   that amount is gonna grow uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately   i  if we re   if we collect fifty or sixty hours  the meeting meetings it will probably be  you know  twenty or thirty percent of it  not   not   not eighty or ninety  but 
 none 	so there s probably   there s three to four a week  that we re aiming for 
 none 	that s what we re aiming for 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and they re each about an hour or something 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	although   yeah 
 none 	we ll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not 
 none 	so   o_k 
 none 	yeah and th  the   the other thing is i m not pos  i m sort of thinking as we ve been through this a few times  that i really don t know   maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty  but i don t know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits 
 none 	right 
 none 	because it s just an added bunch of weird stuff  and  you know  we   we h  we re highly motivated 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh in fact  the morning group is really motivated cuz they re working on connected digits  so it s  
 none 	actually that s something i wanted to ask  is i have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we don t have to hand   transcribe the digits because we re reading them and i have those 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and so i have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance  but i haven t been ru  i haven t been doing that 
 none 	um  if i did that  is someone gonna be working on it 
 none 	uh  yeah  i   i think definitely s  so  absolutely  yeah  whoever we have working on the acoustics for the meeting recorder are gonna start with that 
 none 	i mean  is it something of interest 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i mean  i 
 none 	i m   i m interested in it  i just don t have time to do it now 
 none 	i was   these meetings   i m sure someone thought of this  but these   this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation  um 
 none 	so
 none 	yep 
 none 	yep 
 none 	actually i have o 
 none 	i   i would really like someone to do adaptation  so if we got someone interested in that  i think it would be great for meeting recorder 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well  
 none 	i mean  one of the things i wanted to do  uh  that i  i talked to   to don about  is one of the possible things he could do or m  also  we could have someone else do it  is to do block echo cancellation  to try to get rid of some of the effects of the   the   the far field effects 
 none 	since it s the same people over and over 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  i mean we have   the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation because people move around  and uh  if   if it s   if it s uh not a simple echo  like a cross talk kind of echo  but it s actually room acoustics  it s   it s   it s   you can t really do inversion  and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something   it may   you  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we ve taken is more  lets come up with feature approaches and multi stream approaches and so forth  that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh  that s the party line 
 none 	but it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always  you know  sort of dangerous  it s good   good to sort of test them  actually  and so we haven t had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do  so that s something i d like somebody to do at some point  just take these digits  take the far field mike signal  and the close uh mike signal  and apply really good echo cancellation  um  there was a   have been some nice talks recently by   by lucent on   on their b  the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me  uh you know  trying and change it sample by sample  but you have some reasonable sized blocks 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and um  you know  th 
 none 	w  what is the um   the artifact you try to   you re trying to get rid of when you do that 
 none 	ciao 
 none 	uh so it s   it   you have a   a direct uh  
 none 	uh  what s the difference in   if you were trying to construct a linear filter  that would um  
 none 	i m signing off 
 none 	yeah  that would subtract off the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close talk and the distant 
 none 	you know  so   so uh um
 none 	i guess in most echo cancellation  
 none 	yeah  so you   given that um  
 none 	yeah  so you re trying to   so you d   there s a   a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there s a time delay there  and after the time delay  there s these various reflections 
 none 	and if you figure out well what s the   there s a   a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself   adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract   essentially to subtract off uh different uh   different reflections 
 none 	right  so let s take the simple case where you just had   you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there s a   there s an echo  it comes back 
 none 	and you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo 
 none 	so that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those 
 none 	uh  just the raw data  you would   you might hear kind of an echo 
 none 	and   and then this   noise cancellation would get 
 none 	well  i m   i m   i m saying   that s a simplified version of what s really happening  what s really happening is   well  when i m talking to you right now  you re getting the direct sound from my speech  but you re also getting  uh  the indirect sound that s bounced around the room a number of times 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so now  if you um try to r  you  
 none 	to completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons  but i   but   not to try to completely remove it  that is  invert the   the room response  but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the   the effect of some of the echos 
 none 	um  a number of people have done this so that  say  if you re talking to a speakerphone  uh it makes it more like it would be  if you were talking right up to it 
 none 	so this is sort of the st  the straight forward approach 
 none 	you say i   i   i want to use this uh   this item but i want to subtract off various kinds of echos  so you construct a filter  and you have this   this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh   gets subtracted off from the original speech 
 none 	then you try to   you try to minimize the energy in some sense 
 none 	and so um   uh with some constraints 
 none 	kind of a clean up thing  that   o_k 
 none 	it s a clean up thing  right  so  echo cancelling is   is  you know  commonly done in telephony  and   and   and it s sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you   if  you know  you re gonna be talking some distance from a mike 
 none 	when uh 
 none 	i would have meetings with the folks in cambridge when i was at b_b_n over the phone  they had a um   some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me  it would come on and we d hear all this noise 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and then it was uh   and then it would come on and it was very clear  you know 
 none 	right  so it s taking samples  it s doing adaptation  it s adjusting weights  and then it s getting the sum 
 none 	so um  uh anyway that s   that s kind of a reasonable thing that i d like to have somebody try   somebody look   and   and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with  i think that d be enough data   plenty of data to do that with  and i  for that sort of task you wouldn t care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything  uh 
 search 	is  brian kingsbury s  work related to that  or is it a different type of reverberation  
 none 	um
 none 	brian s kingsbury s work is an example of what we did f  f  from the opposite dogma  right  which is what i was calling the  party line   which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want  we want something more flexible  uh i  i  where people might change their position  and there might be  you know  
 none 	there s also um oh yeah  noise  so the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise 
 none 	it s if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays 
 none 	then we ll figure out the right   the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those   those echos 
 none 	but um if there s noise  then the very signal that it s looking at is corrupted so that it s decision about what the right   you know  right   right uh   delays are   is  uh   is   right delayed signal is   is   is   uh is incorrect 
 none 	and so  in a noisy situation  um  also in a   in a situation that s very reverberant   with long reverberation times and really long delays  it s   it s sort of typically impractical 
 none 	so for those kind of reasons  and also a   a c  a complete inversion  if you actually   i mentioned that it s kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics 
 none 	um  that s difficult because um often times the   the um  
 none 	the system transfer function is such that when it s inverted you get something that s unstable  and so  if you   you do your estimate of what the system is  and then you try to invert it  you get a filter that actually uh  you know  rings  and   and uh goes to infinity  so it s   so there s   there s   there s that sort of technical reason  and the fact that things move  and there s air currents   i mean there s all sorts of   all sorts of reasons why it s not really practical  so for all those kinds of reasons  uh we   we   we sort of um  concluded we didn t want to in  do inversion  and we re even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation  which isn t really inversion  and um we decided to do this approach of taking   uh  just picking uh features  which were   uh will give you more   something that was more stable  in the presence of  or absence of  room reverberation  and that s what brian was trying to do 
 none 	so  um  let me just say a couple things that i was   i was gonna bring up  uh 
 none 	let s see  i guess you   you actually already said this thing about the uh   about the consent forms  which was that we now don t have to  
 none 	so this was the human subjects folks who said this  or that   that    
 none 	the a  apparently   i mean  we re gonna do a revised form  of course  um but once a person has signed it once  then that s valid for a certain number of meetings  she wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form 
 none 	i told her that would be a little bit difficult to say  so i think from a s  practical standpoint  maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings  or something  it won t be that many people who do it that often  but um just  you know  so long as they don t forget that they ve done it  i guess 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um  back on the data thing  so there s this sort of one hour  ten hour  a hundred hour sort of thing that   that we have 
 none 	we have   we have an hour uh that   that is transcribed  we have   we have twelve hours that s recorded but not transcribed  and at the rate we re going  uh by the end of the semester we ll have  i don t know  forty or fifty or something  if we   if this really uh  
 none 	well  do we have that much  let s see  we have  
 none 	not really  it s three to four per week 
 none 	so that s what   you know  that  
 none 	uh eight weeks  uh is  
 none 	so that s not a lot of hours  um  
 none 	eight weeks times three hours is twenty four  so that s   yeah  so like thirty   thirty hours 
 none 	three  
 none 	three hours 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  is there   i know this sounds tough but we ve got the room set up  um
 none 	i was starting to think of some projects where you would use well  similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close talking mikes  there are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting  that don t require any transcription  so what are the patterns  the energy patterns over the meeting 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and i m really interested in this but we don t have a whole lot of data  so i was thinking  you know  we ve got the room set up and you can always think of  also for political reasons  if icsi collected you know  two hundred hours  that looks different than forty hours  even if we don t transcribe it ourselves  so  
 none 	but i don t think we re gonna stop at the end of this semester 
 none 	right  so  i th  i think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months  we are gonna have more like a hundred hours 
 none 	i mean  is there   are there any other meetings here that we can record  especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of deci 
 none 	i mean  that are less well   i don t   uh  that have some more emotional aspects to them  or strong  
 none 	we had some good ones earlier 
 none 	there s laughter  um i m talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings  maybe with manager types  or  
 none 	i think it s hard to record those 
 none 	to be allowed to record them  o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  people will get  
 none 	it s also likely that people will cancel out afterwards  but i   but i wanted to raise the k_p_f_a idea 
 none 	o_k  well  if there is  anyway 
 none 	yeah  i was gonna mention that 
 none 	oh  that s a good idea  that s   that would be a good match 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  so   yeah  so i   i   uh  i   i d mentioned to adam  and   that was another thing i was gonna talk   uh  mention to them before   that uh there s uh   it   it oc  it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media 
 none 	because  you know  we had talked before about the problem about using found data  that   that uh it s just set up however they have it set up and we don t have any say about it and it s typically one microphone  in a  uh  uh   or   and   and so it doesn t really give us the   the   the uh characteristics we want 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um and so i do think we re gonna continue recording here and record what we can 
 none 	but um  it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say  hey you have this panel show  or this   you know  this discussion show  and um can you record multi channel  
 none 	and uh they may be willing to record it uh with  
 none 	with lapel mikes or something 
 none 	well  they probably already use lapel  but they might be able to have it   it wouldn t be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant  it wouldn t be exactly this setup  but it would be that sort of thing  and what we were gonna get from u_w  you know  assuming they   they   they start recording  isn t   als  also is not going to be this exact setup 
 none 	right 
 none 	hunh 
 none 	right  no  i think that d be great  if we can get more data 
 none 	so 
 none 	i   i   i   i was thinking of looking into that  the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion  in fact  is that it s even possible  since of course  many radio shows are not live  uh that we could invite them to have like some of their   record some of their shows here 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	wow 
 none 	well   or   the thing is  they re not as averse to wearing one of these head mount  i mean  they re on the radio  right  so 
 none 	right  as we are 
 none 	right 
 none 	um  i think that d be fantastic cuz those kinds of panels and   those have interesting
 none 	yeah 
 none 	th  that s an   a side of style   a style that we re not collecting here  so it d be great 
 none 	and   and the   i mean  the other side to it was the   what   which is where we were coming from   i ll  
 none 	i ll talk to you more about it later is that   is that there s   there s uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably  uh related to  you know  legal issues and   and permissions and all that  i mean  they already do what they do   do whatever they do  so it s   uh  it s   so it s   so it s another source  so i think it s something we should look into  you know  we ll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at u_w also and um   and maybe we have this other source  but yeah i think that it s not unreasonable to aim at getting  you know  significantly in excess of a hundred hours  i mean  that was sort of our goal 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	the thing was  i was hoping that we could   in the   under this controlled situation we could at least collect  you know  thirty to fifty hours 
 none 	and at the rate we re going we ll get pretty close to that i think this semester 
 none 	and if we continue to collect some next semester  i think we should  uh  
 none 	right  yeah i was mostly trying to think   o_k  if you start a project  within say a month  you know  how much data do you have to work with  and you   you wanna s  you wanna sort of fr  freeze your   your data for awhile so um right now   and we don t have the transcripts back yet from i_b_m right 
 none 	well  we don t even have it for this f  you know  forty five minutes  that was  
 none 	do  
 none 	oh  do we now  so um  not complaining  i was just trying to think  you know  what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now and they re pretty different  because um  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  so i was thinking right now it s sort of this exploratory stuff where you   you look at the data  you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like  and   and   and uh   and meanwhile we collect  and it s more like yeah  three months from now  or six months from now you can   you can do a lot of other things 
 none 	right 
 none 	right  right 
 none 	cuz i m not actually sure  just logistically that i can spend   you know  i don t wanna charge the time that i have on the project too early  before there s enough data to make good use of the time  and that s   and especially with the student uh for instance this guy who seems  
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh anyway  i shouldn t say too much  but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring  how much data will i have to work with  with that person  and so it s  
 none 	right 
 none 	i  yeah  so i would think  exploratory things now 
 none 	uh  three months from now  
 none 	um  i mean the transcriptions i think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven t gotten those back yet as far as the timing  but i think as far as the collection  it doesn t seem to me l  like  uh  unreasonable to say that uh in
 none 	january  you know  ro  roughly uh   which is roughly three months from now  we should have at least something like  you know  twenty five  thirty hours 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and we just don t know about the transcription part of that  so  i mean  it  
 none 	so that s  
 none 	yeah  we need to   i think that there s a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards  and uh es  especially since these people won t be uh used to dealing with multi channel uh transcriptions  so i think that we ll need to adjust some   and also if we wanna add things like um  well  more refined coding of overlaps  then definitely i think we should count on having an extra pass through 
 none 	yep 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	i wanted to ask another a  a  aspect of the data collection  there d be no reason why a person couldn t get together several uh  you know  friends  and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to  right 
 none 	if they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something    i mean  what we re trying to stay away from was artificial constructions  but i think if it s a real  
 none 	why not  yeah 
 none 	i mean  i m thinking  politically  
 none 	stage some political debates 
 none 	you could do this  you know  you could 
 none 	well yeah  or just if you re   if you ha  if there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don t um have them do the digits  or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like if it was  you know  uh  one string of digits  or something  they d probably be willing to do 
 none 	we don t have to do the digits at all if we don t want to 
 none 	then  having the data is very valuable  cuz i think it s um politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data  especially with the i_t_r  if we put in a proposal on it  it ll just look like icsi s collected a lot more audio data  um  whether it s transcribed or not um  is another issue  but there s   there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions  or at least that you can start to answer 
 none 	it seems like you could hold some meetings  you know  you and maybe adam  you   you could   you could maybe hold some additional meetings  if you wanted 
 none 	yep 
 none 	so 
 none 	would it help at all   i mean  we re already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings  one is uh um without doing the digits  
 none 	or  i guess the full blown one is where you do the digits  and everything  and then talk about doing it without digits  what if we had another level  just to collect data  which is without the headsets and we just did the table mounted stuff 
 none 	need the close talking mikes 
 none 	you do  o_k 
 none 	i mean  absolutely  yeah  i m really scared  
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	it seems like it s a big part of this corpus is to have the close talking mikes 
 none 	um or at least  like  me personally  i would   i   couldn t use that data 
 none 	i see  o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i agree  and mari also  we had   this came up when she  she was here  that s important 
 none 	um 
 none 	yeah  i   i  
 none 	so it s a great idea  and if it were true than i would just do that  but it s not that bad   like the room is not the bottleneck  and we have enough time in the room  it s getting the people to come in and put on the   and get the setup going 
 none 	b  by the   by the way  i don t think the transcriptions are actually  in the long run  such a big bottleneck  i think the issue is just that we re   we re blazing that path  right  and   and um   d  do you have any idea when   when uh the   you ll be able to send uh the ten hours to them 
 none 	well  i ve been burning two c_ds a day  which is about all i can do with the time i have  so it ll be early next week 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  o_k  so early next week we send it to them  and then   then we check with them to see if they ve got it and we   we start  you know asking about the timing for it  so i think once they get it sorted out about how they re gonna do it  which i think they re pretty well along on  cuz they were able to read the files and so on  right 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  but  
 none 	well  
 none 	yeah  who knows where they are 
 find_email 	have  they  ever responded to  you   
 none 	nope 
 none 	hhh 
 none 	yeah  but  
 none 	you know  so they   they   they have   you know  they re volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do  right  but they  
 none 	what if  
 none 	yeah  you   we can t complain 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but at any rate  they ll   i   i think once they get that sorted out  they re   they re making cassettes there  then they re handing it to someone who they   who s   who is doing it  and uh
 none 	i think it s not going to be   i don t think it s going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour  i think  it s not going to be thirty t 
 none 	yep  i think that s probably true 
 none 	really 
 none 	so it s the amount of  
 none 	it s   it s just getting it going 
 none 	it s pipeline  pipeline issues  once the pipeline fills 
 none 	right  what about these lunch meetings   i mean  i don t know  if there s any way without too much more overhead  even if we don t ship it right away to i_b_m even if we just collect it here for awhile  to record you know  two or three more meeting a week  just to have the data  even if they re um not doing the digits  but they do wear the headphones 
 none 	but the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and  
 none 	no  i meant  um  sorry  the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs  maybe they don t wanna be recorded  but  
 none 	oh  and we re just chatting 
 none 	just the ch  the chatting  i actually  
 none 	yeah  we have a lot of those 
 none 	i actually think that s useful data  um the chatting  but  
 none 	yeah  the problem with that is i would   i think i would feel a little constrained to   you know 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	you don t wanna do it  cuz  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh  some of the meetings   you know  our  soccer ball  meeting  i guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting 
 none 	alright 
 none 	alright  so i ll just throw it out there  if anyone knows of one more m  or two more wee  meetings per week that happen at icsi  um that we could record  i think it would be worth it 
 none 	that was hilarious 
 none 	yeah  well  we should also check with mari again  because they   because they were really intending  you know  maybe just didn t happen  but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level  so then that would double what we had 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	uh 
 none 	and there s a lot of different meetings at u_w uh  
 none 	i mean really m  a lot more than we have here right cuz we re not right on campus  so 
 none 	right 
 none 	is the uh  notion of recording any of chuck s meetings dead in the water  or is that still a possibility 
 none 	uh  they seem to have some problems with it  we can   we can talk about that later 
 none 	um  but  again  jerry is   jerry s open   so i mean  we have two speech meetings  one uh network meeting  uh jerry was open to it but i   i s 
 none 	one of the things that i think is a little   a little bit of a limitation  there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work  we probably can t do it every week 
 none 	you know  i   i   i   i think that   that people are gonna feel uh   are gonna feel a little bit constrained 
 none 	now  it might get a little better if we don t have them do the digits all the time  and the   then   so then they can just really sort of try to   put the mikes on and then just charge in and   and  
 none 	yep 
 none 	what if we give people   you know  we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something 
 none 	well  you know  i   i do think eating while you re doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise  but i had another question  which is um  you know  in principle  w  um  i know that you don t want artificial topics  but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn t be too artificial  i mean  we could   political discussions  or   or something or other  and i  you know  people who are   because  you know  there s also this constraint  we d  it s like  you know  the   the   uh goldibears   goldi  goldilocks  it s like you don t want meetings that are too large  but you don t want meetings that are too small  and um   a  and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj  human subject p  p  pool  in the positive sense of the word 
 none 	o_k  alright  alright  alright 
 none 	no   definitely 
 none 	well  even   i mean  coming down from campus is sort of a big thing  but what about or what about people in the   in the building 
 none 	we could pay subjects 
 none 	yeah  i was thinking  there s all these other peo  yeah 
 none 	i mean  there s the state of california downstairs  and  
 none 	i mean  
 none 	i just really doubt that uh any of the state of california meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so i   i mean i talked with some people at the haas business school who are i  who are interested in speech recognition and  they sort of hummed and hawed and said  well maybe we could have meetings down here   but then i got email from them that said  no  we decided we re not really interested and we don t wanna come down and hold meetings  
 none 	alright  well 
 none 	so  i think it s gonna be a problem to get people regularly 
 none 	what about joachim  maybe he can  
 none 	but   but we c  but i think  you know  we get some scattered things from this and that  and i   i d  i do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the   with the radio  uh i  i have better contacts in radio than in television  but  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	you could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  and they re already   they re   these things are already recorded  we don t have to ask them to   even   and i m not sure wh  how they record it  but they must record from individual  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	n  well  
 none 	no  i m not talking about ones that are already recorded 
 none 	i m talking about new ones because   because   because we would be asking them to do something different 
 none 	why   why not 
 none 	well  we can find out  i know for instance mark liberman was interested uh in   in l_d_c getting data  uh  and  
 none 	right  that s the found data idea  but what i m saying is uh if i talk to people that i know who do these th  who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel  let s say  of a distant mike 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and u  i think routinely they would not do this 
 none 	so  since i m interested in the distant mike stuff  i wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere and uh   but if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e  e  willing to   the   i might be able to talk them into it 
 none 	right  great   o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  we re getting towards the end of our disk space  so we should think about trying to wrap up here 
 none 	o_k  well i don t   why don t we   why d  u  why don t we uh uh turn them   turn the  
 none 	that s a good way to end a meeting 
 none 	o_k  leave   leave them on for a moment until i turn this off  cuz that s when it crashed last time 
 none 	oh 
 none 	that s good to know 
 none 	turning off the microphone made it crash  well  
 none 	that s good to know 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  we seem to be recording 
 none 	alright  we re not crashing 
 none 	so  sorry about not   not pre doing everything  the lunch went a little later than i was expecting 
 none 	number four 
 none 	chuck 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	chuck was telling too many jokes  or something 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep  pretty much 
 none 	o_k 
 open_agenda 	does anybody have an agenda  
 none 	no 
 find_email 	well   i m   i  sent  a couple of items    they re   they re sort of practical  i don t know if you re   if   if that s too practical for what we re focused on 
 none 	i thought somebody had  yeah  that s right 
 none 	yeah  we only want th  useless things  yeah  no  why don t we talk about practical things  sure 
 none 	i mean  we don t want anything too practical  yeah  that would be  
 none 	o_k 
 add_agenda_item 	well  um  i can give you  an update on the transcription effort   
 none 	great 
 add_agenda_item 	uh  maybe raise  the issue of microphone  uh  um procedures with reference to the cleanliness of the recordings   
 none 	b 
 add_agenda_item 	o_k   transcription   uh   microphone issues   
 add_agenda_item 	and then maybe ask  th  uh  these guys    the   we have great   great  uh  p  steps forward in terms of the nonspeech speech pre segmenting of the signal   
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well  we have steps forward 
 none 	well  it s a   it s a big improvement 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yes 
 none 	i would prefer this 
 none 	yeah  well  o_k 
 none 	uh  
 add_agenda_item 	we talk about  the   the results of use  
 none 	you have some  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 add_agenda_item 	i have a little bit of  i_ram stuff  but i m not sure if that s of general interest or not  
 none 	uh  bigram 
 none 	i_ram  
 none 	i_ram  
 none 	i_ram 
 none 	well  m  maybe 
 none 	i_ram  bigram  you know 
 none 	bi  bigram 
 none 	yeah  let s   let s see where we are at three thirty  um  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	since  uh   since i have to leave as usual at three thirty  can we do the interesting stuff first 
 none 	i beg your pardon 
 none 	well  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what s the interesting stuff 
 none 	which is    
 none 	i beg your pardon 
 none 	yeah  th  now you get to tell us what s the interesting part  but   yeah 
 none 	please specify 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  uh  i guess the work that s been done on segmentation would be most   yeah 
 none 	i think that would be a good thing to start with 
 none 	o_k 
 find_calendar_entry 	um  and  um  the other thing  uh  which i ll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit  which is that  um  uh  one of the suggestions that came up in a  brief meeting   i  had the other day when i was in  spain  with  uh   manolo pardo  and  javier  uh  ferreiros   who was here before  was  um  why not start with what they had before but add in the non silence boundaries  
 none 	yeah 
 search 	so  in what  javier  did before when they were doing  um   h  he was  looking for  uh  speaker change points   
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um 
 none 	as a simplification  he originally did this only using silence as  uh  a putative  uh  speaker change point 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  uh  he did not  say  look at points where you were changing broad sp  uh  phonetic class  for instance 
 none 	and for broadcast news  that was fine 
 none 	here obviously it s not 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  um  so one of the things that they were pushing in d  in discussing with me is  um  w  why are you spending so much time  uh  on the  uh  feature issue  uh  when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before and then just broadened it a bit  instead of just ta  using silence as putative change point also    
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	so then you ve got   you already have the super structure with gaussians and h_  you know  simple h_m_ms and so forth 
 none 	nnn  yeah 
 none 	and you   you might  
 none 	so there was a   there was a little bit of a   a   a   a difference of opinion because i   i thought that it was   it s interesting to look at what features are useful 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  uh  on the other hand i saw that the   they had a good point that  uh  if we had something that worked for many cases before  maybe starting from there a little bit   because ultimately we re gonna end up with some s  su  kind of structure like that  where you have some kind of simple h_m_m and you re testing the hypothesis that  uh  there is a change  so   so anyway  i just   reporting that  but  uh  uh  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  yeah  why don t we do the speech nonspeech discussion 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	do   i   i hear   you   you didn t  
 none 	speech nonspeech  o_k 
 none 	uh huh  yeah 
 none 	um  so  uh  what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to   to detect s  speech or nonspeech portions in that 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and what i did so far is i just used our old munich system  which is an h_m_m ba  based system with gaussian mixtures for s  speech and nonspeech 
 none 	and it was a system which used only one gaussian for silence and one gaussian for speech  and now i added  uh  multi mixture possibility for   for speech and nonspeech  and i did some training on   on one dialogue  which was transcribed by  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	jose 
 none 	yeah  we   we did a nons  s  speech nonspeech transcription  adam  dave  and i  we did  for that dialogue and i trained it on that 
 none 	and i did some pre segmentations for   for jane  and i m not sure how good they are or what   what the transcribers say  they   they can use it or    
 none 	uh  they   they think it s a terrific improvement  and  um  it real  it just makes a   a world of difference 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and  um  y  you also did some  something in addition which was  um  for those in which there was  uh  quiet speakers in the mix 
 none 	yeah  uh  yeah  that   that was one   one   one thing  uh  why i added more mixtures for   for the speech  so i saw that there were loud   loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers  and so i did two mixtures  one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and did you hand label who was loud and who was quiet  or did you just    
 none 	i did that for   for five minutes of one dialogue and that was enough to   to train the system  and so it   it adapts  uh  on   while running  so 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	w 
 none 	what    
 none 	hopefully 
 none 	what kind of  uh  front end processing did you do 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	it s just our   our old munich  uh  loudness based spectrum on mel scale twenty   twenty critical bands and then loudness 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and four additional features  which is energy  loudness  modified loudness  and zero crossing rate 
 none 	so it s twenty four   twenty four features 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	and you also provided me with several different versions  which i compared 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	and so you change parameters  what   do you wanna say something about the parameters that you change 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you can specify the minimum length of speech or   and silence portions which you want  and so i did some   some modifications in those parameters  basically changing the minimum   minimum length for s  for silence to have  er  to have  um   yeah   to have more or less  uh  silence portions in  inserted  so 
 none 	right  so this would work well for  uh  pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that  but for overlap i imagine that doesn t work at all  that you ll have plenty of s  sections that are  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s it  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm  mm hmm  that s true  but it   it saves so much time   the   the transcribers just enormous  enormous savings  fantastic 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  
 none 	but  
 none 	yep 
 none 	that s great 
 none 	um  just qu  one quickly  uh  still on the features  so you have these twenty four features  uh  a lot of them are spectral features  is there a   a transformation  uh  like principal components transformation or something  just  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	no 
 none 	no  w  w  we   originally we did that but we saw  uh  when we used it  uh  f  for our close talking microphone  which   yeah  for our   for our recognizer in munich   we saw that w  it s   it s not   it s not so necessary  it   it works as well f  with   with   without  uh  a l_d_a or something 
 none 	yeah  it was i_s two 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  no  i was j  curious  yeah  i don t think it s a big deal for this application  but   but   yeah  it s a  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k  but then there s another thing that also thilo s involved with  which is  um  
 none 	o_k  and   and also da  dave gelbart  so there s this   this problem of   and w  and   so we had this meeting  th  the   also adam  before the   the   before you went away 
 none 	uh we  um   regarding the representation of overlaps  because at present  um  because of the limitations of th  the interface we re using  overlaps are  uh  not being encoded by the transcribers in as complete and  uh  detailed a way as it might be  and as might be desired   i think would be desired in the corpus ultimately 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so we don t have start and end points at each point where there s an overlap  we just have the   the overlaps encoded in a simple bin 
 none 	well  o_k  so  the limits of the over  of   of the interface are such that we were   at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand the   the interface or find other tools which already do what would be useful  because what would ultimately be  um  ideal in my   my view and i think   i mean  i had the sense that it was consensus  is that  um  a thorough going musical score notation would be the best way to go 
 none 	because you can have multiple channels  there s a single time line  it s very clear  flexible  and all those nice things 
 none 	mm hmm 
 find_calendar_entry 	o_k   so  um  um  i spoke    i  had a  meeting  with  dave gelbart  on   on   and he had  uh  excellent ideas on how the interface could be modified to   to do this kind of representation  
 none 	but  um  he   in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already  um  existing interfaces which might already have these properties  so  do you wanna say something about that 
 find_calendar_entry 	yes   um   i  talked with  uh   munich guys from   from ludwi  ludwig maximilians university   who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and they basically said they have   they have  uh  a tool they developed themselves and they can t give away  uh  f  it s too error prone  and had   it s not supported  a  a  a  and  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  um 
 none 	susanne bur  burger  who is at se  c_m_u  he wa  who was formally at   in munich and w  and is now at   with c_m_u  she said she has something which she uses to do eight channels  uh  trans  transliterations  eight channels simultaneously  but it s running under windows 
 none 	excuse me 
 none 	under windows  mm hmm 
 none 	so i m not sure if   if   if we can use it  she said she would give it to us  it wouldn t be a problem 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and i ve got some   some kind of manual down in my office 
 none 	well  maybe we should get it and if it s good enough we ll arrange windows machines to be available 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm  we could   uh  potentially so  i also wanted to be sure  
 none 	so 
 search 	i mean  i ve   i ve seen the   this   this is called  praat   p_r_a_a_t  which i guess means spee  speech in dutch or something  
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  but then i m not sure that s the right thing for us 
 none 	but  
 none 	in terms of it being windows versus   but i m just wondering  is    
 none 	yeah 
 none 	no  no  praat isn t   praat s multi platform 
 none 	no  no  praat  
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	oh  i see  oh  i see  so praat may not be  
 none 	yeah 
 search 	that s not praat   it s called   trans  transedit   i think   the   the  uh   the tool from   from susanne 
 none 	it s a different one 
 none 	i see  oh  i see 
 none 	o_k  o_k  alright 
 none 	the other thing  uh  to keep in mind  uh   i mean  we ve been very concerned to get all this rolling so that we would actually have data  but  um  i think our outside sponsor is actually gonna kick in and ultimately that path will be smoothed out  so i don t know if we have a long term need to do lots and lots of transcribing  i think we had a very quick need to get something out and we d like to be able to do some later because just it s inter  it s interesting 
 none 	mmm  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but as far a  you know  uh  with   with any luck we ll be able to wind down the larger project 
 none 	oh 
 none 	but you s 
 none 	what our decision was is that we ll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and   and do what we can later to clean that up if we need to 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	and   and i was just thinking that  um  if it were possible to bring that in  like  you know  this week  then when they re encoding the overlaps it would be nice for them to be able to specify when   you know  the start points and end points of overlaps  uh th  they re making really quick progress 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s great 
 create_single_reminder 	and  um  so my   my goal was   w  m  my charge was to  get eleven hours by the end of the month    and it ll be   i m   i m   i m clear that we ll be able to do that 
 none 	that s great  yeah 
 send_email 	and did you  uh  forward  morgan   brian s  thing  
 find_email 	i sent it to  um   who did i send that to   i sent it to a list and i thought i sent it to the   e  to  the local list    you saw that 
 none 	meeting recorder 
 none 	oh  you did  o_k  so you probably did get that 
 find_calendar_entry 	so  brian  did tell me that in fact what you said  that  uh   that our   that they are making progress and that he s going   that they re going   he s gonna check the f  the output of the first transcription and   and  
 none 	i mean  basically it s   it s all the difference in the world  i mean  basically he s   he s on it now 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  that s   this is a new development  o_k 
 none 	so   so   so this is   so i  it ll happen 
 none 	super  super  o_k  great 
 none 	yeah  i mean  basically it s just saying that one of our   one of our best people is on it  you know  who just doesn t happen to be here anymore  someone else pays him  so   so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	isn t that great 
 none 	but about the need for transcription  i mean  don t we   didn t we previously decide that the i_b_m transcripts would have to be checked anyway and possibly augmented 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yes  that s true 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so  i think having a good tool is worth something no matter what 
 none 	yeah  s  o_k  that s   that s a good point 
 create_single_reminder 	yeah  and  dave gelbart  did volunteer  and since he s not here  i ll repeat it   to at least  modify transcriber   which  if we don t have something else that works  i think that s a pretty good way of going  
 none 	good 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and we discussed on some methods to do it  my approach originally  and i ve already hacked on it a little bit   it was too slow because i was trying to display all the waveforms  but he pointed out that you don t really have to  i think that s a good point 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	that if you just display the mix waveform and then have a user interface for editing the different channels  that s perfectly sufficient 
 none 	yeah  exactly  and just keep those things separate  and   and  um  dan ellis s hack already allows them to be able to display different waveforms to clarify overlaps and things  so that s already  
 none 	no  they can only display one  but they can listen to different ones 
 none 	oh  yes  but  
 none 	well  uh  yes  but what i mean is that  uh  from the transcriber s perspective  uh  those two functions are separate  and dan ellis s hack handles the  um  choice   the ability to choose different waveforms from moment to moment 
 none 	but only to listen to  not to look at 
 none 	um  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the waveform you re looking at doesn t change 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s true  yeah  but that s   that s o_k  cuz they re   they re  you know  they re focused on the ear anyway  and then   and then the hack to preserve the overlaps better would be one which creates different output files for each channel  which then would also serve liz s request of having  you know  a single channel  separable  uh  cleanly  easily separable  uh  transcript tied to a single channel  uh  audio 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 find_email 	have  uh   folks from nist  been in contact with  you   
 none 	not directly  i m trying to think if   if i could have gotten it over a list  i don t   i don t think so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  well  holidays may have interrupted things  cuz in   in   in    they seem to want to get absolutely clear on standards for   transcription standards and so forth with   with us  
 none 	oh  this was from before december  yeah 
 none 	right  because they re   they re presumably going to start recording next month 
 none 	o_k  o_k 
 create_single_reminder 	oh   we  should  definitely get with them then  and agree upon a format   
 none 	so 
 find_email 	though  i  don t remember email on  that    so was i not in the loop on that 
 none 	um  yeah  i don t think i mailed anybody  i just think i told them to contact jane   that  uh  if they had a   if  uh   that   that  uh  as the point person on it  but  
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	that s right 
 none 	yeah  i think that s right  just  uh  
 none 	so  yeah  maybe i ll  uh  ping them a little bit about it to get that straight 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i m keeping the conventions absolutely as simple as possible 
 none 	yeah  so is it   cuz with any luck there ll actually be a   a   there ll be collections at columbia  collections at   at u_w  
 none 	i mean dan   dan is very interested in doing some other things  and collections at nist  so  
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	well  i think it s important both for the notation and the machine representation to be the same 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so 
 none 	n  there was also this  uh  email from dan regarding the speech non  nonspeech segmentation thing 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 create_single_reminder 	i don t know if  uh  uh  we wanna  uh   and  dan gel  and dave gelbart  is interested in  pursuing the aspect of using amplitude as a   a   a   as a basis for the separation   
 none 	oh  yeah  he was talking   he was talking   i mean  uh  we   he had  
 none 	cross correlation 
 none 	cross 
 none 	yeah  cross correlation  i had mentioned this a couple times before  the c  the commercial devices that do  uh  uh  voice  uh   you know  active miking  basically look at the amp  at the energy at each of the mikes  and   and you basically compare the energy here to some function of all of the mikes  so  by doing that  you know  rather than setting any  uh  absolute threshold  you actually can do pretty good  uh  selection of who   who s talking 
 none 	cross 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and those   those systems work very well  by the way  i mean  so people use them in panel discussions and so forth with sound reinforcement differing in   in sort of  uh   and  uh  those   if  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	boy  the guy i knew who built them  built them like twenty   twenty years ago  so they re   it s   the   the techniques work pretty well 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	fantastic 
 none 	so 
 none 	cuz there is one thing that we don t have right now and that is the automatic  um  channel identifier 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	that   that  you know  that would g  help in terms of encoding of overlaps  the   the transcribers would have less  uh  disentangling to do if that were available 
 none 	yeah  so i think  you know  basically you can look at some   p  you have to play around a little bit  uh  to figure out what the right statistic is  but you compare each microphone to some statistic based on the   on the overall  
 none 	but 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh  and we also have these   we have the advantage of having distant mikes too  so that  you cou  yo 
 none 	yeah  although the   the   using the close talking i think would be much better  wouldn t it 
 none 	um 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i   i don t know  i just   it d be  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	if i was actually working on it  i d sit there and   and play around with it  and   and get a feeling for it  i mean  the   the   the  uh   but  uh  you certainly wanna use the close talking  as a   at least 
 none 	right 
 none 	i don t know if the other would   would add some other helpful dimension or not 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k  what   what are the different  uh  classes to   to code  uh  the   the overlap  you will use 
 none 	um  to code d  so types of overlap 
 none 	what you   you   yeah 
 none 	um  so at a meeting that wasn t transcribed  we worked up a   a typology 
 none 	and  um  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	look like  uh  you t  you explaining in the blackboard  the     yeah  yeah 
 none 	yes  exactly  that hasn t changed  so it i  the   it s basically a two tiered structure where the first one is whether the person who s interrupted continues or not  and then below that there re subcategories  uh  that have more to do with  you know  is it  uh  simply backchannel or is it  um  someone completing someone else s thought  or is it someone in  introducing a new thought 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	huh 
 none 	and i hope that if we do a forced alignment with the close talking mike  that will be enough to recover at least some of the time the time information of when the overlap occurred 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm  well  one would  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we hope 
 none 	yeah  who knows 
 none 	that d be   that d be nice  i mean 
 none 	i   i   i   i ve  
 none 	so who s gonna do that  who s gonna  do forced alignment  
 create_single_reminder 	well  u  uh   i_b_m  was going to   um   and i imagine they still plan to but   but  you know  i haven t spoken with them about that recently 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	oh 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh huh 
 send_email 	well  uh  my suggestion now is   is on  all of these things  to  uh  contact  brian   
 none 	this is wonderful to have a direct contact like that  uh well  th  lemme ask you this  it occurs to me   one of my transcribers t  told me today that she ll be finished with one meeting  um  by   well  she said tomorrow but then she said   you know  but   the  you know   let s   let s just  uh  say maybe the day after just to be s  on the safe side 
 none 	o_k  i ll do that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 send_email 	i could send  brian   the  um   the transcript    i know these are   er  uh  i could send him that if it would be possible  or a good idea or not  to try to do a s  forced alignment on what we re   on the way we re encoding overlaps now 
 none 	well  just talk to him about it 
 none 	yep 
 none 	good 
 none 	i mean  you know  basically he s   he just studies  he s a colleague  a friend  and  uh  they   and   and  you know  the   the organization always did wanna help us  it was just a question of getting  you know  the right people connected in  who had the time  so  um  eh  
 none 	yeah  super  super 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	is he on the mailing list 
 none 	the meeting recorder mailing li    we should add him 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i   i   i don t know for sure 
 none 	did something happen  morgan  that he got put on this  or was he already on it  or    
 none 	add him 
 none 	no  i  eh  eh  p 
 none 	it   it oc  i   h  it s  
 none 	yeah  something happened  i don t know what  but he s on it now 
 none 	he asked for more work 
 none 	huh 
 none 	that would be like   that d be like him  he s great 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  uh  where are we  maybe  uh  uh  brief  
 none 	well  let s   why don t we talk about microphone issues  that was   that was a  
 none 	yeah  that d be great 
 none 	um  so one thing is that i did look on sony s for a replacement for the mikes   for the head m  head worn ones cuz they re so uncomfortable 
 none 	but i think i need someone who knows more about mikes than i do  because i couldn t find a single other model that seemed like it would fit the connector  which seems really unlikely to me 
 search 	does anyone  like  know  stores  or know about  mikes   who   who would know the right questions to ask   
 none 	oh  i probably would  i mean  my knowledge is twenty years out of date but some of it s still the same  so  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh  so maybe we c  we can take a look at that 
 none 	you couldn t   you couldn t find the right connector to go into these things 
 none 	yep 
 none 	huh 
 none 	when i looked  i  they listed one microphone and that s it as having that type of connector  but my guess is that sony maybe uses a different number for their connector than everyone else does 
 none 	and   and so   it seems   it seems really unlikely to me that there s only one 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well  let s look at it together and  
 none 	and there s no adaptor for it 
 none 	seems like there d be a   o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	as i said  who knows 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	who   who are we buying these from  that d be a  
 none 	um 
 none 	i have it downstairs  i don t remember off the top of my head 
 none 	yeah  o_k 
 none 	yeah  we   we can try and look at that together 
 none 	and then  uh   just in terms of how you wear them  
 search 	i mean  i had thought about this before   i mean  when   when   when you use a product like  dragondictate   they have a very extensive  description about how to wear the microphone and so on   
 none 	oh 
 none 	but i felt that in a real situation we were very seldom gonna get people to really do it and maybe it wasn t worth concentrating on 
 none 	but  
 none 	well  i think that that s   that s a good back off position  that s what i was saying earlier  th  that  you know  we are gonna get some recordings that are imperfect and  hey  that s life  but i   i think that it   it doesn t hurt  uh  the naturalness of the situation to try to have people wear the microphones properly  if possible  because  um  the natural situation is really what we have with the microphones on the table  i mean  i think  you know  in the target applications that we re talking about  people aren t gonna be wearing head mounted mikes anyway  so this is just for u  these head mounted mikes are just for use with research 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	oh  that s true 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  uh  it s gonna make  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you know  if   if an  andreas plays around with language modeling  he s not gonna be m  wanna be messed up by people breathing into the microphone  so it s   it s  uh  uh  
 none 	right 
 search 	well  i ll dig through the  documentation to dragondictate  and ste  s  see if they still have the little form  
 none 	but it does happen  right  i mean  and any  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s interesting  uh 
 none 	i talked to some i_b_m guys  uh  last january  i think  i was there  and   so people who were working on the   on their viavoice dictation product 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and they said  uh  the breathing is really a   a terrible problem for them  to   to not recognize breathing as speech 
 none 	wow 
 none 	so  anything to reduce breathing is   is   is a good thing 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  that s the  
 none 	it seemed to me when i was using dragon that it was really microphone placement helped an   in  uh   an enormous amount  so you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose  it doesn t   the wind doesn t hit the mike 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and then  uh  
 none 	everyone s adjusting their microphones  of course 
 none 	and then just close enough so that you get good volume  so you know  wearing it right about here seems to be about the right way to do it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	is   uh huh 
 none 	i remember when i was   when i   i   i   i used  uh  um  a prominent laboratory s  uh  uh  speech recognizer about  uh  
 none 	this was  boy  this was a while ago  this was about twelve   twelve years ago or something 
 none 	and  um  they were   they were perturbed with me because i was breathing in instead of breathing out  and they had models for   they   they had markov models for br  breathing out but they didn t have them for breathing in 
 none 	uh  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s interesting 
 none 	well  what i wondered is whether it s possible to have   to maybe use the display at the beginning to be able to   to judge how   how correctly   i mean  have someone do some routine whatever  and   and then see if when they re breathing it s showing  i don t know if the   if it s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i  
 none 	i mean  when   when it s on  you can see it  you can definitely see it  absolutely  absolutely 
 none 	can you see the breathing  cuz i  
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i 
 none 	and so  you know  i ve   i ve sat here and watched sometimes the breathing  and the bar going up and down  and i m thinking 
 none 	i could say something  but
 none 	i mean  i think  
 none 	i don t want to make people self conscious  stop breathing 
 none 	it   it s going to be imperfect  you re not gonna get it perfect 
 none 	yeah  uh huh 
 none 	and you can do some  uh  you know  first order thing about it  which is to have people move it  uh  uh  a  away from being just directly in front of the middle but not too far away 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	good 
 none 	yeah  i 
 none 	and then  you know  i think there s not much   because you can t al  you know  interfere w  you can t fine tune the meeting that much  i think  it s sort of  
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s true  it just seems like i  if something l  simple like that can be tweaked and the quality goes  you know  uh  dramatically up  then it might be worth doing 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and then also   the position of the mike also  if it s more directly  you ll get better volume 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so   so  like  yours is pretty far down below your mouth  yeah 
 none 	but   mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	my   my feedback from the transcribers is he is always close to crystal clear and   and just fan  fantastic to  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mmm  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i don t know why that is 
 none 	well  i mean  you   yeah  of course  you re   you re also   uh  your volume is   is greater  but   but still  i mean  they   they say  
 none 	i ve been eating a lot 
 none 	uh 
 none 	i  it makes their   their job extremely easy  yeah 
 none 	and then there s mass 
 none 	anyway 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i could say something about   about the   well  i don t know what you wanna do  yeah 
 none 	about what 
 none 	about the transcribers or anything or     i don t know 
 none 	well  the other   why don t we do that 
 none 	but  uh  just to   to  um  
 none 	one more remark  uh  concerning the s_r_i recognizer  um 
 none 	it is useful to transcribe and then ultimately train models for things like breath  and also laughter is very  very frequent and important to   to model 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so  if you can in your transcripts mark   mark very audible breaths and laughter especially  um   o_k 
 none 	so  mark them 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	they are  they re putting   eh  so in curly brackets they put  inhale  or  breath  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	it   they   and then in curly brackets they say  laughter   now they re   they re not being awfully precise  uh  m  so they re two types of laughter that are not being distinguished  one is when sometimes s  someone will start laughing when they re in the middle of a sentence 
 none 	oh  great 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and   and then the other one is when they finish the sentence and then they laugh 
 none 	so  um  i   i did s  i did some double checking to look through   i mean  you d need to have extra hhh e  extra complications  like time tags indicating the beginning and ending of   of the laughing through the utterance  and that   and what they re doing is in both cases just saying  curly brackets laughing  a  after the unit 
 none 	it s not so   i don t think it s  um  
 none 	as   as long as there is an indication that there was laughter somewhere between two words
 none 	yeah 
 none 	good 
 none 	oh 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i think that s sufficient  because actually the recognition of laughter once you kn  um   you know  is pretty good  so as long as you can stick a   you know  a t  a tag in there that   that indicates that there was laughter  that would probably be  uh  sufficient to train models 
 none 	against   they could do forced alignment 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  i didn t know that 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	then  
 none 	that would be a really interesting prosodic feature  when  
 none 	and let me ask y  and i gotta ask you one thing about that  so  um  if they laugh between two words  you   you d get it in between the two words  but if they laugh across three or four words you   you get it after those four words  does that matter 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  the thing that you   is hard to deal with is whe  when they speak while laughing 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  and that s  uh   i don t think that we can do very well with that  so  
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  um  that s not as frequent as just laughing between speaking  so  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh is it 
 none 	so are   do you treat breath and laughter as phonetically  or as word models  or what 
 none 	i think he s right  yeah 
 none 	huh 
 none 	i   i think it s frequent in   in the meeting 
 none 	we tried both  uh  currently  um  we use special words 
 none 	there was a   there s actually a word for   uh  it s not just breathing but all kinds of mouth   uh  mouth   mouth stuff 
 none 	mm hmm  mouth stuff 
 none 	and then laughter is a   is a special word 
 none 	how would we do that with the hybrid system 
 none 	same thing 
 none 	same thing 
 none 	so train a phone in the neural net 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  you ha  oh  and each of these words has a dedicated phone 
 none 	no  
 none 	oh  it does 
 none 	so the   so the   the mouth noise  uh  word has just a single phone  um  that is for that 
 none 	right  so in the hybrid system we could train the net with a laughter phone and a breath sound phone 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	i mean  it s   it s   it s always the same thing  right  i mean  you could   you could say well  let   we now think that laughter should have three sub  sub  sub units in the   the three states  uh   different states  and then you would have three   i mean  you know  eh  eh  it s u 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and the   the pronun  the pronunciations   the pronunciations are l  are somewhat non standard  they actually are   uh  it s just a single  s  uh  you know  a single phone in the pronunciation  but it has a self loop on it  so it can   r  can go on forever 
 none 	do whatever you want  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	no 
 none 	to go on forever 
 none 	and how do you handle it in the language model 
 none 	it s just a   it s just a word  we train it like any other word  yeah 
 none 	it s just a word in the language model  cool 
 none 	we also tried  um  absorbing these   uh  both laughter and   and actually also noise  and  um  
 none 	sorry to interrupt 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	is  
 none 	if you want  i got it 
 none 	andreas 
 none 	yes 
 none 	the copies are ready  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	anyway  we also tried absorbing that into the pause model   i mean  the   the   the model that   that matches the stuff between words 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  um  it didn t work as well  so 
 none 	huh  o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	can you hand me your digit form 
 none 	sorry 
 none 	i just wanna mark that you did not read digits 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	say hi for me 
 none 	good 
 none 	you   you did get me to thinking about   i   i m not really sure which is more frequent  whether f  f  laughing   i think it may be an individual thing  some people are more prone to laughing when they re speaking 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i think  
 none 	i was noticing that with dan in the one that we  uh   we hand tran  hand segmented  that   th  he has these little chuckles as he talks 
 none 	but i can t  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i m sure it s very individual  and   and   one thing that c  that we re not doing  of course  is we re not claiming to  uh  get   be getting a representation of mankind in these recordings  we have this very  very tiny sample of   of  
 none 	yeah  o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	speech researchers 
 none 	uh  yeah  and   yeah  r  right  so  uh  who knows 
 none 	speech research 
 none 	uh  
 none 	yeah  why don  why don t we just   since we re on this vein  why don t we just continue with  uh  what you were gonna say about the transcriptions and    
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um  um  the   i   i m really very for  i m extremely fortunate with the people who  uh  applied and who are transcribing for us  they are  um  um  uh really perceptive and very  um   and i m not just saying that cuz they might be hearing this 
 none 	cuz they re gonna be transcribing it in a few days 
 none 	no  they re super  they re   the  they   very quick 
 none 	o_k  turn the mikes off and let s talk 
 none 	yeah  i know  i am   i m serious  they re just super 
 none 	so i  um  e  you know  i   i brought them in and  um  trained them in pairs because i think people can raise questions   you know  i  i  the  they think about different things and they think of different   and um 
 none 	that s a good idea 
 none 	i trained them to  uh  f  on about a minute or two of the one that was already transcribed  this also gives me a sense of  
 none 	you know  i can   i can use that later  with reference to inter coder reliability kind of issues 
 none 	but the main thing was to get them used to the conventions and  you know  the idea of the   th  th  the size of the unit versus how long it takes to play it back so these   th  sort of calibration issues 
 none 	and then  um  i just set them loose and they re   they all have e  a  already background in using computers  they re  um   they re trained in linguistics  they got  
 none 	good 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	oh  no  is that good or bad 
 none 	well  they  they re very perce  they ll   so one of them said  well  you know  he really said   n    not really   and    so what   what should i do with that   and i said   well for our purposes 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 search 	i do have a convention   if it s an   a noncanonical p   that one  i think we   you know  with  eric s work   i sort of figure we   we can just treat that as a variant  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but i told them if   if there s an obvious speech error  uh  like i said in one thing  and i gave my   my example  like i said   microfon  in  instead of  microphone  
 none 	yes 
 none 	didn t bother   i knew it when i said it  i remember s  thinking  oh  that s not correctly pronounced   but it   but i thought it s not worth fixing cuz often when you re speaking everybody knows what   what you mean 
 none 	you ll self repair  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but i have a convention that if it s obviously a noncanonical pronunciation   a speech error with   you know  wi  within the realm of resolution that you can tell in this native english  
 none 	american english speaker  you know that i didn t mean to say  microfon  
 none 	then you d put a little tick at the beginning of the word  and that just signals that  um  this is not standard  and then in curly brackets  pron error  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  um  and other than that  it s w  word level  but  you know  the fact that they noticed  you know  the   nnn     he said   nnn    not   and    what shall i do with that   i mean  they re very perceptive 
 none 	and   and s  several of them are trained in i_p_a  c  they really could do phonetic transcription if   if we wanted them to 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right  well  
 none 	but  
 none 	hmm  where were they when we needed them 
 none 	well  you know  it might be something we d wanna do with some  uh  s  small subset of the whole thing 
 none 	i think  
 none 	we certainly wouldn t wanna do it with everything 
 none 	and i m also thinking these people are a terrific pool  i mean  if  uh   so i   i told them that  um  we don t know if this will continue past the end of the month and i also   m  i think they know that the data p  source is limited and i may not be able to keep them employed till the end of the month even  although i hope to 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	the other thing we could do  actually  uh  is  uh  use them for a more detailed analysis of the overlaps 
 none 	and  
 none 	oh  that d be so super  they would be so   s  so terrific 
 none 	right 
 none 	i mean  this was something that we were talking about  we could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times 
 none 	right  one for each participant 
 none 	so they could by hand  
 none 	well  that s one way to do it  but i ve been saying the other thing is just go through it for the overlaps  right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm  that s right  and with the right in  interface  
 none 	given that y  and   and do   so instead of doing phonetic  uh  uh  transcription for the whole thing  which we know from the   steve s experience with the switchboard transcription is  you know  very  very time consuming  and   and you know  it took them i don t know how many months to do   to get four hours  and so that hasn t been really our focus 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  we can consider it  but  i mean  the other thing is since we ve been spending so much time thinking about overlaps is   is maybe get a much more detailed analysis of the overlaps 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but anyway  i m   i m open to c  our consideration 
 none 	that d be great 
 none 	i   i don t wanna say that by fiat  i m open to every consideration of what are some other kinds of detailed analysis that would be most useful  and  uh  uh 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i   i   i think this year we   we actually  uh  can do it 
 none 	oh  wonderful 
 none 	it s a   we have   we have   due to variations in funding we have   we seem to be doing  uh  very well on m  money for this   this year  and next year we may have   have much less  so i don t wanna hire a  
 none 	is   you mean two thousand one 
 none 	calendar year or    
 none 	uh  i mean  calendar year two thousand one 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  so it s   uh  it s   we don t wanna hire a bunch of people  a long term staff  because the   the funding that we ve gotten is sort of a big chunk for this year  but having temporary people doing some specific thing that we need is actually a perfect match to that kind of  uh  funding  so 
 none 	full time  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	wonderful 
 none 	and then school will start in   in the sixt  on the sixteenth  some of them will have to cut back their hours at that point  but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	are they working full time now  or    
 none 	some of them are  yeah 
 none 	wow 
 none 	well  why do  i wouldn t say forty hour weeks  no  but what i mean is  
 none 	oh  i shouldn t say it that way because that does sound like forty hour weeks  no 
 none 	i th  i   i would say they re probably   they don t have o  they don t have other things that are taking away their time 
 none 	i don t see how someone could do forty hours a week on transcription 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	but it s   you can t 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	no  you re right  it s   i  it would be too taxing  but  um  they re putting in a lot of  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and   and i checked them over  i   i   i haven t checked them all  but just spot checking  they re fantastic 
 none 	i  
 none 	i remember when we were transcribing berp  uh  uh  uh  ron kay  uh  volunteered to   to do some of that  and  he was   the first   first stuff he did was transcribing chuck 
 none 	i think it would be  
 none 	and he s saying  you   you know  i always thought chuck spoke really well   
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	well  you know  and i also thought  y  liz has this  eh  you know  and i do also  this   this interest in the types of overlaps that are involved  these people would be great choices for doing coding of that type if we wanted  or whatever  so  um 
 none 	we d have to mark them 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think it would also be interesting to have  uh  a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do  cuz i m curious about inter annotator agreement 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  th  that d be  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think that s a   a good idea  you know  there s also  the e  in my mind 
 none 	i think a  an  andreas was leading to this topic  the idea that  um  we haven t yet seen the   the type of transcript that we get from i_b_m  and it may just be  you know  pristine  but on the other hand  given the lesser interface   cuz this is  you know   we ve got a good interface  we ve got great headphones  m  um  
 none 	it could be that they will uh   theirs will end up being a kind of fir  first pass or something 
 none 	something like that 
 none 	maybe an elaborate one  cuz again they probably are gonna do these alignments  which will also clear things up 
 none 	that s   that s true  al  although you have to s  don t you have to start with a close enough approximation of the   of the verbal part to be able to    
 none 	well  tha  that s   that s debatable  right  i mean  so the   so the argument is that if your statistical system is good it will in fact  uh  clean things up  right  so it  it s got its own objective criterion 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  uh  so in principle you could start up with something that was kind of rough  
 none 	i mean  to give an example of  um  something we used to do  uh  at one point  uh  back   back when chuck was here in early times  is we would take  um  da  take a word and  uh  have a canonical pronunciation and  uh  if there was five phones in a word  you d break up the word  uh  into five equal length pieces which is completely gross 
 none 	wrong  yeah 
 none 	right  i mean  th  the timing is off all over the place in just about any word 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but it s o_ k 
 none 	you start off with that and the statistical system then aligns things  and eventually you get something that doesn t really look too bad 
 none 	oh  excellent  o_k 
 none 	so   so i think using a   a good aligner  um  actually can   can help a lot  um 
 none 	but  uh  you know  they both help each other  if you have a   if you have a better starting point  then it helps the aligner 
 none 	if you have a good alignment  it helps the  uh  th  the human in   in taking less time to correct things  so   so  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	excellent 
 none 	i guess there s another aspect  too  and i don t know   uh  this   this is   very possibly a different  uh  topic  but  uh  just let me say with reference to this idea of  um  higher order organization within meetings  so like in a   you know  the topics that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other  uh  uses of the data  so being able to find where so and so talked about such and such  then  um  um   e  i mean  i   i   i did sort of a   a rough pass on encoding  like  episode like level things on the  uh  transcribed meeting   already transcribed meeting 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and i don t know if  um   where that   i  if that s something that we wanna do with each meeting  sort of like a  um   it s like a manifest  when you get a box full of stuff  or   or if that s  um  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i mean  i  i   i don t know what uh  level of detail would be most useful  i don t know i  if that s something that i should do when i look over it  or if we want someone else to do  or whatever 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but this issue of the contents of the meeting in an outline form 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	meaning really isn t my thing 
 none 	um  
 none 	i think it just   whoever is interested can do that 
 none 	i mean  so if someone wants to use that data  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	we re running a little short here  we  uh  uh  cou  trying to   eh  was   p  well  you know  the thing i m concerned about is we wanted to do these digits and   and i haven t heard  uh  from jose yet  so  
 none 	that s fine 
 none 	i m finished 
 none 	oh  yeah 
 none 	oh  yes  mm hmm 
 none 	o_k  what do you want 
 none 	uh  
 none 	we could skip the digits  we don t have to read digits each time 
 none 	uh  
 none 	i   i   i think it   you know  another   another bunch of digits  more data is good 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  sure 
 none 	so   so i d like to do that  but i think  do you  maybe  eh    
 none 	did you prepare some whole thing you wanted us just to see  or what was that 
 none 	yeah  it s   it s prepared 
 none 	yeah  uh  how long a    
 none 	oh  k  sorry 
 none 	i   i think it s   it s fast  because  uh 
 none 	i have the results  eh  of the study of different energy without the law length  
 none 	eh  um  eh   in the   in the measurement  uh  the average  uh  dividing by the   by the  um  variance 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  i   th  i  the other  uh   the   the last w  uh  meeting   eh  i don t know if you remain   we have problem to   with the   with   with the parameter   with the representations of parameter  because the   the valleys and the peaks in the signal  eh  look like  eh  it doesn t follow to the   to the energy in the signal 
 none 	yes 
 none 	right 
 none 	and it was a problem  uh  with the scale 
 none 	eh  the scale 
 none 	with what 
 none 	scale 
 none 	scale 
 none 	eh  and i   i change the scale and we can see the   the variance 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but the bottom line is it s still not  uh  separating out very well  right  o_k 
 none 	yeah  yeah  the distribution   the distribution is   is similar 
 none 	so that s   that s   that s enough then  o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	no  i mean  that there s no point in going through all of that if that s the bottom line  really  so  i   i think we have to start  
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh  i mean  there  there s two suggestions  really  which is  uh   what we said before is that  um  it looks like  at least that you haven t found an obvious way to normalize so that the energy is anything like a reliable  uh  indicator of the overlap 
 none 	mmm  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  i   i m   i m still a little f  think that s a little funny  these things l   seems like there should be  but   but you don t want to keep  uh   keep knocking at it if it s   if you re not getting any   any result with that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  i mean  the other things that we talked about is  uh  pitch related things and harmonicity related things  so   which we thought also should be some kind of a reasonable indicator 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  
 none 	but  uh  a completely different tack on it wou  is the one that was suggested  uh  by your colleagues in spain  which is to say  don t worry so much about the  uh  features 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that is to say  use  you know  as   as you re doing with the speech  uh  nonspeech  use some very general features 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  uh  then  uh  look at it more from the aspect of modeling 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you know  have a   have a couple markov models and   and  uh  try to indi  try to determine  you know  w  when is th  when are you in an overlap  when are you not in an overlap 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and let the  uh  uh  statistical system determine what s the right way to look at the data 
 none 	i   i  um 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think it would be interesting to find individual features and put them together  i think that you d end up with a better system overall 
 none 	but given the limitation in time and given the fact that javier s system already exists doing this sort of thing  uh  but  uh  its main limitation is that  again  it s only looking at silences which would   maybe that s a better place to go 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i   i   i think that  eh  the possibility  eh  can be that  eh 
 none 	thilo  eh  working  eh  with a new class  not only  eh  nonspeech and speech  but  eh  in   in   in the speech class  dividing  eh  speech  eh  of   from a speaker and overlapping  to try   to   to do  eh  eh  a fast   a fast  eh  experiment to   to prove that  nnn  this fea  eh  general feature  eh  can solve the   the   the problem  and wh  what   nnn  how far is  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	maybe  yeah 
 none 	and  i   i have prepared the   the pitch tracker now 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and i hope the   the next week i will have  eh  some results and we   we will show   we will see  eh  the   the parameter   the pitch  eh  tracking in   with the program 
 none 	i see 
 none 	ha  h  have you ever looked at the  uh  uh   javier s  uh  speech segmenter 
 none 	and  nnn  nnn  
 none 	no 
 none 	oh  maybe m  you could  you kn  uh show thilo that 
 none 	no 
 none 	no 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	yeah  sure 
 none 	cuz again the idea is there   the limitation there again was that he was   he was only using it to look at silence as a   as a   as a   as a p  putative split point between speakers  but if you included  uh  broadened classes then in principle maybe you can cover the overlap cases 
 none 	i  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mmm  yeah 
 none 	yeah  but i m not too sure if   if we can really represent overlap with   with the s  detector i   i   i used up to now  the   to speech nonspeech as   it s only speech or it s   it s   it s nonspeech  so 
 none 	uh  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i think with  
 none 	ah 
 none 	that s right  but i think javier s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	n  n 
 none 	i think javier s might be able to  it doesn t have the same gaus  uh  h_m_ m modeling  which is i think a drawback 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but  uh  
 none 	well  it s   sort of has a simple one  right  it s   it s just   it s just a   isn t it just a gaussian for each    
 none 	mmm  yeah 
 none 	does it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and then he ch  you choose optimal splitting 
 none 	oh  it doesn t have   it doesn t have any temporal  uh     i thought it  
 none 	maybe i m misremembering  but i did not think it had a markov  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i gues 
 none 	i guess i don t remember either 
 none 	uh  it s been a while 
 none 	javier  
 none 	uh 
 none 	yeah  uh  i could have a look at it  so 
 none 	you mean ja  eh  eh  javier program  no  javier di  doesn t worked with  uh  a markov  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  i didn t think so 
 none 	oh  o_k   so he s just   he just computes a gaussian over potential   oh  i see  i see  and   and  
 none 	he on  only train  
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  it was only gaussian 
 none 	this is the idea 
 none 	and so i   i think it would work fine for detecting overlap 
 none 	it s just  uh  that i  it   he has the two pass issue that  
 none 	what he does is  as a first pass he   he   p  he does  um  a guess at where the divisions might be and he overestimates 
 none 	and that s just a data reduction step  so that you re not trying at every time interval 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and so those are the putative places where he tries 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  o_k 
 none 	and right now he s doing that with silence and that doesn t work with the meeting recorder 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so if we used another method to get the first pass  i think it would probably work  it s a good method 
 none 	yeah  sure 
 none 	yeah  yeah  o_k 
 none 	as long as the len  as long the segments are long enough 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  o_k  so let me go back to what you had  though  um 
 none 	that s the other problem 
 none 	so  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	the other thing one could do is   couldn t   i mean  it s   so you have two categories and you have markov models for each 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	couldn t you have a third category 
 none 	so you have  uh   you have  uh  nonspeech  single person speech  and multiple person speech 
 none 	he has this on his board actually 
 none 	don t you have  like those   those several different categories on the board 
 none 	right  and then you have a markov model for each 
 none 	um  
 none 	i m not sure  i   i thought about  uh  adding  uh  uh  another class too  but it s not too easy  i think  the   the transition between the different class  to model them in   in the system i have now  but it   it   it could be possible  i think  in principle 
 none 	i see 
 none 	i see 
 none 	yeah  i mean  i  
 none 	this is all pretty gross  i mean  the   th  the reason why  uh  i was suggesting originally that we look at features is because i thought  well  we re doing something we haven t done before  we should at least look at the space and understand  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it seems like if two people   two or more people talk at once  it should get louder  uh  and  uh  uh  there should be some discontinuity in pitch contours  and  uh  there should overall be a  um  smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic sequence in the spectrum 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i had the impression 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	so those are all things that should be there  so far  um  uh  jose has   has been  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	by the way  i was told i should be calling you pepe  but   by your friends  but 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh 
 none 	anyway  um  uh  the   has   has  uh  been exploring  uh  e  largely the energy issue and  um  as with a lot of things  it is not   uh  like this  it s not as simple as it sounds  and then there s  you know   is it energy  is it log energy  is it l_p_c residual energy  is it   is it   is it  uh  delta of those things  uh  what is it no  obviously  just a simple number   absolute number isn t gonna work  so it should be with   compared to what  should there be a long window for the normalizing factor and a short window for what you re looking at  or  you know  how b  short should they be  so  th  he s been playing around with a lot of these different things and   and so far at least has not come up with any combination that really gave you an indicator  so
 none 	yeah  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 create_single_reminder 	i   i still have a hunch that there s   it s in there some place  but it may be   given that  you  have a limited time here  it   it just may not be the best thing to   to   to  focus on for the remaining of it    so pitch related and harmonic related 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	to overrule   yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i m   i m somewhat more hopeful for it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but it seems like if we just wanna get something to work  that  uh  their suggestion of   of  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	th  they were suggesting going to markov models  uh  but in addition there s an expansion of what javier did  and one of those things  looking at the statistical component  even if the features that you give it are maybe not ideal for it  it s just sort of this general filter bank or   or cepstrum or something  um  
 none 	one 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	eee it s in there somewhere probably 
 none 	but  eh  what did you think about the possibility of using the javier software 
 none 	eh  i mean  the  uh   the  uh   the bic criterion  the   the   t  to train the   the gaussian  eh  using the   the mark  eh  by hand  eh  eh  to distinguish be  mmm  to train overlapping zone and speech zone  i mean  eh  i   i   i think that an interesting  eh  experiment  eh  could be  th  eh  to prove that  mmm  if s  we suppose that  eh  the   the first step  
 none 	i mean  the   the classifier what were the classifier from javier or classifier from thilo 
 none 	w  what happen with the second step 
 none 	i   i mean  what   what happen with the  eh   the  uh  clu  the  uh   the clu  the clustering process 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	using the   the gaussian  yeah 
 none 	you mean javier s 
 none 	what do you mean 
 none 	i   i mean  that is   is enough   is enough  eh  to work well  eh  to  eh  separate or to distinguish  eh  between overlapping zone and  eh  speaker zone 
 none 	because th  if   if we   if we  eh  nnn  develop an classifier   and the second step doesn t work well  eh  we have another problem  n 
 none 	i  
 none 	yeah  i had tried doing it by hand at one point with a very short sample  and it worked pretty well  but i haven t worked with it a lot 
 none 	so what i d  i d  i took a hand segmented sample and i added ten times the amount of numbers at random  and it did pick out pretty good boundaries  but this was just very anecdotal sort of thing 
 none 	nnn  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah  but is   is   if  
 none 	but it s possible with my segmentation by hand that we have information about the   the overlapping  uh   yeah 
 none 	right  so if we   if we fed the hand segmentation to javier s and it doesn t work  then we know something s wrong 
 none 	the  
 none 	n  n  yeah  no 
 none 	the demonstration by hand  segmentation by hand i   i   i think is the fast experiment 
 none 	yeah  i think that s probably worthwhile doing 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	uh  we can prove that the   this kind o  emph  emphasizes parameter and gaussian  
 none 	whether it ll work or not  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	y  do you know where his software is  have you used it at all 
 none 	i yeah have  i have 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so 
 none 	i   i have as well  so if you need   need help let me know 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	let s read some digits

 none 	and we are  
 none 	that s hard to focus on that  you know  really  it s like    alright  now where am i  
 none 	alright 
 none 	so 
 none 	so are you  
 none 	are we going 
 none 	it is uh  must be february fifteenth 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yu 
 none 	i think the date s written in there  yep  and actually if everyone could cross out the r_nine next to  session   and write m_r eleven 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  we didn t have a front end meeting today 
 none 	and let s remember also to make sure that one s gets marked as unread  unused 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	m_r eleven 
 none 	m_r eleven 
 none 	that sounds like a spy code 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	o_k  so 
 none 	there s lots of clicking i m sure as i m trying to get this to work correctly 
 none 	agenda 
 none 	any agenda items today 
 none 	i wanna talk a little bit about getting   how we re gonna to get people to edit bleeps  parts of the meeting that they don t want to include 
 none 	what i ve done so far  and i wanna get some opinions on  how to   how to finish it up 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i wanna ask about um  some aud  audio monitoring on some of the um well some of the equipment 
 none 	in particular  the   well uh  that s just what i wanna ask 
 none 	o_k audio monitoring  jane 
 none 	ba  based on some of the tran  uh   i 
 none 	in listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things  and in pact   in fact this one i m talking on is one of   of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings  so i   mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	oh really 
 none 	 spikes   you mean like uh  instantaneous click type spikes  or    
 none 	spikes 
 none 	clicks 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	huh 
 none 	and i don t know what the e  electronics is but 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  well  i think it s uh  it   it could be a number of things  it could be touching and fiddling  and the other thing is that it could   the fact that it s on a wired mike is suspicious  it might be a connector 
 none 	touching 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	well maybe  
 none 	then we don t really have to talk about that as an   i   i take that off the agenda 
 none 	you could try an experiment and say  o_k  i m about to test for spikes   and then wiggle the thing there  and then go and when they go to transcribe it  it could  ask them to come and get you   come get me when you transcribe this and see if there s spikes  
 none 	yeah  right 
 none 	oh that  
 none 	well 
 none 	um 
 none 	no i m just  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i mean  were this a professional audio recording  what we would do   what you would do is   in testing it is  you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that   that   that things are not giving that kind of performance 
 none 	and if they are  then they can t be used 
 none 	right 
 none 	so 
 none 	um  let s see  i guess i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh  recording  transcription you know  basically you know where we are on the corpus 
 none 	good 
 none 	and then um  the other thing which i would like to talk about which is a real meta quest  i think  deal is  uh  agendas 
 none 	so maybe i ll   i ll start with that actually  uh  um 
 none 	andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know  if possible  what we were gonna be talking about because he s sort of peripherally involved to this point  and if there s gonna be a topic about   discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come and  
 none 	and i think part of   part of his motivation with this is that he s trying to help us out  in the   because of uh the fact that the meetings are   are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up and so  he figures he could help that out by not showing   and   and i m sure help out his own time  by not showing up if it s a meeting that he s   he s  
 none 	mmm 
 none 	so  uh in order  
 none 	i d   i think that this is a wish on his part  uh  it s actually gonna be hard because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated and   and  
 none 	but um  we could try anyway  uh  do another try at coming up with the agenda uh  at some point before the meeting  uh  say the day before 
 none 	right 
 none 	well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on wednesday  or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	you   you wanna volunteer to do that 
 none 	sure 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	alright so we ll send out agenda request 
 none 	uh 
 none 	let me
 none 	that ll be   i think that ll help  
 none 	i ll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done 
 none 	that ll help a lot  actually 
 none 	yeah  i have to tell you for the uh   for the admin meeting that we have  lila does that um every time before an admin meeting 
 none 	and uh  she ends up getting the agenda requests uh  uh ten minutes before the meeting  but   but   but 
 none 	uh 
 none 	but we can try 
 none 	maybe it ll work 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah  maybe 
 none 	weirder things have happened 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i m wondering if he were to just  uh  specify particular topics  i mean 
 none 	maybe we d be able to meet that request of his a little more 
 none 	i would   i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there ll be more things of interest to him 
 none 	well then  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	actually it  
 none 	this   this maybe brings up another topic which is um  
 none 	so we re done with that topic 
 none 	the other topic i was thinking of was the sta  status on microphones and channels  and all that 
 none 	yeah  actually i   i was going to say we need to talk about that too 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	why   why don t we do that 
 none 	o_k  um  the new microphones  the two new ones are in 
 none 	um  and they are being assembled as we speak  i hope 
 none 	and i didn t bring my car today so i m gonna pick them up tomorrow 
 none 	um  and then the other question i was thinking about is   well  a couple things  first of all  if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable  we should probably just go ahead and get them 
 none 	so we ll have to evaluate that when they come in  and get people s opinions on   on what they think of them 
 none 	uh 
 none 	um  then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless 
 none 	another wireless setup  i mean it s expensive  but it does seem to be better than the wired 
 none 	so how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup 
 none 	um  well 
 none 	i m pretty sure that you can daisy chain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless 
 none 	so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike  possibility of six wireless receivers  and apparently you can chain those together 
 none 	and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes 
 none 	so  um 
 none 	and  
 none 	so let s see we  
 none 	so  you know it s still  it s fifteen minus six 
 none 	right  so we could have up to nine 
 none 	and right now we can have up to six 
 none 	right 
 none 	and we have five  we re getting one more 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and it s um  about nine hundred dollars for the base station  and then eight hundred per channel 
 none 	oh  so yeah so the only  
 none 	beyond the mike   the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that s nine hundred dollars 
 none 	right 
 none 	oh  we should do it 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  so i ll look into how you daisy chain them and   and then just go ahead and order them 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i don t quite understand how that   how that works   if  
 none 	so we re not increasing the number of channels 
 none 	no  we re just replacing the wired   the two wired that are still working  along with a couple of the wired that aren t working  one of the wired that s not working  with a wireless 
 none 	o_k  o_k  i see 
 none 	yeah  basically we found  
 none 	three wireds work  right 
 none 	i   i guess three wireds work  yeah 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	yeah  but we ve had more problems with that 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and that sort of bypasses the whole   the whole jimbox thing and all that 
 none 	right 
 none 	and so um  we   we seem to have uh  a reliable way of getting the data in  which is through the ra  sony radio mikes  as long as we re conscious about the batteries 
 none 	that seems to be the key issue 
 none 	right 
 none 	everyone s battery o_k 
 none 	i checked them this morning  they should be 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um 
 none 	that s the only thing with them  but the quality seems really good and  
 find_email 	um  i  heard from  u_w  that  they re   they re uh very close to getting their  uh setup purchased    they re   they re   they re buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf 
 send_email 	well  we  should talk to  them  about it because i know that  s_r_i is also in the process of looking at stuff  and so  you know  what we should try to keep everyone   on the same page with that   
 none 	yeah 
 none 	s_r_i  really 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh 
 none 	they got sa  apparent 
 none 	well 
 none 	maybe this needs to be bleeped out  i have no clue 
 none 	uh  i don t know  probably we shouldn t   probably we shouldn t talk about funding stuff 
 none 	i don t know how much of it s public 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but anyway there s   there s   there s uh  uh other activities that are going on there and   and uh   and nist and u_w  so 
 none 	um  but   but yeah i thin  i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that  our experience is   is quite positive with the sony  uh  radio mikes  
 none 	right 
 none 	now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you re talking about changing the headsets meaning changing the connector  which means some hand soldering or something  right 
 none 	uh  no  we re having the   them do it  so it s so  hand soldering it  but i m not doing it 
 none 	no 
 none 	oh 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  they   they charge right 
 none 	nothing against you and your hand soldering but  
 none 	you ve never seen my hand soldering 
 none 	but uh  a  as i said they re coming in 
 none 	uh 
 none 	o_k  so that s being done professionally and   yeah 
 none 	i   i mean   yeah  i mean 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	as professionally as i guess you can get it done 
 none 	well  it could   if they do a lot of it  it s  
 none 	i mean i  it s just their repair shop 
 none 	right  their maintenance people 
 none 	well  we ll see what it   it s like  that   tha  that can be quite good 
 none 	yep 
 none 	th  this   yeah  o_k 
 none 	good  yeah  so let s go with that  uh 
 none 	and  i mean we ll see  tomorrow  you know  what it looks like 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  um  uh 
 none 	dave isn t here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits 
 none 	uh  so he ll be interested in what s going on with that  i guess   was   the decision last time was that the   the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well 
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	has that started  or is that    
 none 	uh  it would be to use his interface and i was going to meet with him today about that 
 none 	right  so  the decision was that jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork  so i did the   all that last week 
 none 	so all the   all the forms are now on the computer 
 none 	and uh  then i have a bunch of scripts that we ll read those and let the uh transcribers use different tools  and i just want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so he has a nice set up that they   it w  it will be efficient for them to do that 
 none 	o_k  so anyway  
 none 	i   i don t think it ll take too long 
 none 	so  you know  just uh  a matter of a few days i suspect 
 none 	so anyway i think we   we have at least one uh  user for the digits once they get done  which will be dave 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i ve already done five or six sets 
 none 	so if he wanted to  you know  just have a few to start with  he could 
 none 	yeah  he might   he might be asking  
 none 	you know  and i also have a bunch of scripts that will  like  generate p_files and run recognition on them also 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh  is dave  
 find_calendar_entry 	i don t know if  dave  is on the list  if he s invited to these  meetings    uh if he knows  
 none 	i don t tend to get an invitation myself for them even 
 none 	no  no 
 none 	uh  we don t have a active one but i ll make sure he s on the list 
 none 	yeah 
 make_call 	should we call  him    i mean is he   d  is he definitely not available today 
 none 	i don t know 
 make_call 	should i call  his office  and see  
 none 	uh  well i  it s uh  
 none 	he was in  yeah 
 none 	i mean  he s still taking classes  so uh  he may well have conflicts 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  he was in s 
 none 	he wasn t there at cof 
 none 	yeah  so this might be a conflict for him 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh  so 
 find_calendar_entry 	yeah didn t  he  say his  signal processing class  was like
 none 	i think he has a class  yeah 
 none 	tuesdays and thursdays  
 none 	yeah  he might have 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	you talking about david gelbart 
 none 	oh well  whatever 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yes 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i think he s taking two twenty five a_ which is now 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so 
 none 	yeah  o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  that s why we re not seeing him  o_k 
 none 	uh  transcriptions  uh  beyond the digits  where we are  and so on 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um  
 none 	and the   and the recordings also  just where we are 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  so um  should we   we don t wan  wanna do the recording status first  or    
 none 	well  we have about thirty two hours uh as of 
 none 	i guess a week and a half ago  so we probably now have about thirty  five hours 
 none 	and   and that s   that s uh   how much of that is digits 
 none 	it s uh   that s including digits  right 
 none 	that s including digits  i haven t separated it out so i have no clue how much of that is digits 
 none 	so  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so anyway there s at least probably thirty hours  or something of  
 none 	there s got to be more than thirty hour   i  it couldn t   of  
 none 	of   of non digits 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	of non digits 
 none 	yeah  absolutely  i mean  the digits don t take up that much time 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  and the transcribers h  i  uh  don t have the exact numbers  but i think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh  transcribing from them right now  the next step is to   that i m working on is to insure that the data are clean first  and then channelized  what i mean by clean is that they re spell checked  that the mark up is consistent all the way throughout  and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh  liz requested in terms of um  um in terms of having a s  a systematic handling of numbers  and acronyms which i hadn t been specific about 
 none 	um  for example  i  they ll say uh  ninety two   and you know  so how   you could   e  exactly  so if you just say  nine two   the   there are many s  ways that could have been expressed  an  and i just had them  
 none 	nine two  right 
 none 	i   i mean  a certain number of them did put the words down  but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by  um  a gloss th  and things 
 none 	you know  jane 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  one suggestion and you may already be doing this  but
 none 	i ve noticed in the past that when i ve gone through transcriptions and you know in   in order to build lexicons and things  if you um  just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them  a lot of times just scanning down that list you ll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis 
 none 	misspelled 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you re talking about the type token frequency listings  and i use those too 
 none 	y  you mean just uh on each   on each line there s a one word right 
 none 	it s one token from the   from the corpus 
 none 	mm hmm  mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  those are e  extremely efficient and i  and i   i agree that s a very good use of it 
 none 	oh so you already have that  o_k 
 none 	well that s   that s a way   that s   you know  the spell check basically does that but   but in addition   yes  that s   that s exactly the strategy i wanna do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren t in the lexicon 
 none 	mm hmm  cuz a lot of times they ll appear next to each other  and uh  i  in alphabetized lists  they ll appear next to each other and   and so it makes it easier 
 none 	exactly  and then you ca  then you can do a s 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	absolutely  i agree 
 none 	that s a very good   that s a very good uh  suggestion 
 none 	and that was   that s my strategy for handling a lot of these things  in terms of things that need to be glossed  i didn t get to that point but  
 none 	so there are numbers  then there are acronyms  and then um  there s a   he  she wants the uh  actually a   an explicit marker of what type of comment this is  so i  curly b  inside the curly brackets i m gonna put either
 none 	 voc  for vocalized  like cough or like laugh or whatever 
 none 	 nonvoc  for door slam  and  gloss  for things that have to do with   if they said a s  a spoken form with this   m  this pronunciation error  i already had that convention but i  
 none 	right 
 none 	oh that s great 
 none 	i haven t been asking these people to do it systematically cuz i think it most   ha  most efficiently handled by uh   by a   a filter  that was what i was always planing on  so that  you know you get a whole long list   exactly what you re saying  you get a whole list of things that say  curly bracket laugh curly bracket   then y  you know it s   it s   you   you risk less error if you handle it by a filter  than if you have this transcriber ch  laboriously typing in sort of a voc space  so man 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so many ways that error prone 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  um  um i m   i m going to convert that via a filter  into these tagged uh  subcategorized comments  and same thing with you know  we see you get a subset when you do what you re saying  you end up with a s  with uh  you re collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens and you can um  have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes  but the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand  because  you know i mean  jus 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	you don t know what they could be 
 none 	yeah now timit s clear um and p_l_p is clear but uh there are things that are not so well known  in   or   or have variant   u  u  uses like the numbers you can say  nine two  or you can say  ninety two   and uh
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so how are you doing the  
 none 	i d handle the numbers individually 
 none 	how are you doing the uh  acronyms so if i say p_z_m what would it appear on the transcript 
 none 	it would be separate   the letters would be separated in space and potentially they ll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e  but i m not sure if that s necessary  clarifying what it is  so gloss of whatever 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	i don t know if that s really necessary to do that 
 none 	maybe it s a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh  a step away from i  indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there  and indicating why they re there to indicate that it s uh the you know  uh enumerated  or i  it s not a good way of saying   but it s   it s the specific uh way of stating these   these letters 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right  so it sounds good 
 none 	and so anyway  the clean   those are those things and then channelized is to then um  get it into this multichannel format 
 none 	and at that point then it s ready for use by liz and don 
 none 	but that s been my top priority   beyond getting it tanel  channelized  the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	and uh  thilo had a   e  e  a breakthrough with this   this last week in terms of getting the channel based um uh s  s  speech nonspeech segmentation um  up and running and i haven t   i haven t been able to use that yet cuz i m working s  re  this is my top priority   get the data clean  and channelized 
 none 	i actually gave
 none 	have you also been doing spot checks  jane 
 none 	oh yes  well you see that s part of the cleaning process  i spent um actually um i have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers  and i went through it last night  it s   it s almost spooky how similar these are  word for word  and there are some differences in commas cuz commas i   i left them discretion at commas 
 none 	okay  good 
 none 	oh good  good 
 none 	right 
 none 	uh   and so because it s not part of our st  of our ne  needed conventions 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and um  and   so they ll be a difference in commas  but it s word by word the same  in   in huge patches of the data  and i have t  ten minute stretch where i can   where i can show that  and   and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon  and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech  so um  the one i  i  the colloquial speech person picked up  gobbledy gook   and the other one didn t  and on this side  this one s picking up things like  neural nets  and the one that s good on the sp  o  on th  the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn t 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	when   for the person who missed  gobbledy gook  what did they put 
 none 	it was an interesting approximation  put in parentheses  cuz i have this convention that  i  if they re not sure what it was  they put it in parentheses 
 none 	oh 
 none 	so they tried to approximate it  but it was   it was spelled g_a_b_b_l  
 none 	oh good 
 none 	sort of how it sounds 
 none 	yes  more of an attempt to   i mean apparently it was very clear to her that these   the  a  this   this was a sound   these are the sounds  but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it was a technical term that she didn t recognize 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  but she knew that she didn t know it  maybe it was a technical ter  exactly  but she   even though her technical perception is just really   uh you know i ve   i m tempted to ask her if she s taken any courses in this area or if she s taken cognitive science courses then cuz  neural nets  and   oh she has some things that are   oh  downsampled   she got that right 
 none 	right 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and some of these are rather uh unexpected 
 none 	obscure  yeah 
 none 	but ch  ten solid uh   m  ch  s  chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data  and um  
 none 	and   and again the main track that you re working with is elev  eleven hours  is that right 
 none 	yes exactly 
 none 	yeah  o_k 
 none 	and that s part of this  
 none 	eleven hours 
 none 	is that   is that   that including digits 
 none 	yes it is  mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so let s say roughly ten hours or so of  
 none 	i mean it s probably more than that but   but with   of   of non digits 
 none 	it d be more than that because i   my recollection is the minutes   that da  digits don t take more than half a minute  per person 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	but um the   the total set that i gave them is twelve hours of tape 
 none 	oh  i see 
 none 	but they haven t gotten to the end of that yet  so they re still working   some of them are   two of them are still working on completing that 
 none 	oh  i see 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	boy  they re moving right along 
 none 	yeah  they are  mm hmm  they re very efficient 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	there re some who have more hours that they devote to it than others  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so what   what   what s the deal with   with your  
 none 	the channel u  thing 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  it s just uh  i ran the recognizer   uh  the speech nonspeech detector on different channels and  it s just in uh   in this new multi channel format and output  and
 none 	oh  i see 
 none 	i just gave one   one meeting to   to liz who wanted to   to try it for   for the recognizer as uh  apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech  which took too much memory or whatever  and so she   she will try that i think and   i m   i m working on it  so  i hope  
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	is this anything different than the h_m_m system you were using before 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	no 
 none 	uh 
 none 	i mmm  use some   some different features but not   not   the basic thing is this h_m_m base 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so there s still no   no knowledge using different channels at the same time  you know what i mean 
 none 	there is some  uh as the energy is normalized across channels yeah 
 none 	across all of them  o_k 
 none 	so  but basically that s one of the main changes 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	what are some of the other features  besides the energy  you said you re trying some different features  or something 
 none 	oh i just uh   mmm 
 none 	i just use um our loudness based things now as they   before there were   they were some in   in the log domain and i   i changed this to the   to the  
 none 	cu  cube root 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	to  
 none 	no  i changed this to the   to the   to the loudness thingy with the   with the how do you call it  i m not sure 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	ah 
 none 	with the  uh  
 none 	fletcher munson  
 none 	no 
 search 	i m not sure about the term  
 none 	oh  o_k 
 create_single_reminder 	uh   i ll   look it up    and say it to you 
 none 	yeah  alright 
 none 	uh  o_k  and   yeah  that s   that s basically the   the   the thing 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  and i   and i tried t  to normalize uh   uh the features  there s loudness and modified loudness  um  within one channel  because they re  yeah to   to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech 
 none 	and it works quite well  but  not always 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	good 
 none 	um  let s see 
 none 	i think the uh  
 none 	were   were you basically done with the transcription part 
 none 	so i guess the next thing is this uh   bleep editing 
 none 	right  so the  
 none 	the idea is that we need to have   we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don t want  so i ve written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages  uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece   pieces and they can scroll through and read them  and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded 
 none 	and then  it s a form  h_t_m_l form  so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded 
 none 	and so  uh  some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and so i thought about this a little bit and i think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password  a single password  each person will have a single password  user name and password 
 none 	and then each meeting  we ll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it 
 none 	and that way each person only has to remember one password 
 none 	i   i can t help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed  i mean if people have  
 none 	uh  i mean  for me i would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and i would sort of flip through it 
 none 	and then um if i thought it was o_k  i d say  it s o_k  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  i   uh   i mean it depends how this really ends up working out  but i guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was o_k or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare 
 none 	right  i mean so th  th  th  the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that i had already done for other reasons 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and so that   that s a minor part of it  i just wanted some web interface so that people   you didn t actually have to send everyone the text 
 none 	so m  what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready  um i would take them  and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted  and just uh  tell them   here s the web page   um   you need a password   so th  th  question number one is how do we distribute the passwords  and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it 
 none 	that s  
 none 	i think what i was sort of saying is that if you just say
 none 	 here is a   here is   
 none 	i mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but   but i just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper  that said  uh   here s what was said in this transcription is it o_k with you  and if it is  here s this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it s o_k   and then they d hand it back to you 
 none 	i think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide 
 none 	but certainly i wouldn t want a printout  these are big  and i would much rather be ha  be able to just sit and leaf through it 
 none 	you find it easier to go through a large   i mean how do you read books 
 none 	well i certainly read books by hand  but for something like this  i think it s easier to do it on the web 
 none 	really 
 none 	i mean  it  
 none 	cuz you re gonna get  you know  if i   i m   i m in a bunch of meetings and i don t wanna get a stack of these  i wanna just be able to go to   go to the web site and visit it as i want 
 none 	going to a web site is easy  but flipping through a hundred pounds   a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web 
 none 	well  i don t think it s that much harder than  paper 
 none 	i have one question  so are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript  because i   i do think that there s a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the  
 none 	really 
 none 	so 
 none 	so here s the way i was imagining it  and maybe i m wrong  but the way i imagined it was that um  the largest set of people is gonna go  oh yeah  i didn t say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead  where s the   where s the release  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and then there ll be a subset of people  right    o_k there s   i mean think of who it is we ve been recording mostly  o_k there ll be a subset of people  who um  will say uh  well  yeah  i really would like to see that   and for them  the easiest way to flip through  if it s a really large document 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean unless you re searching  searching  of course  should be electronic  but if you re not   so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that  but see then we re getting more elaborate with this thing 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um if   if uh you don t have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really  really long document  i mean whenever i ve had a really  really long document that it was sitting on the web  i ve always ended up printing it out 
 none 	i mean  so it s   it s   i mean  you   you re   you re not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time  you wanna figure you have a train ride  and there s all these situations where   where i  
 none 	i mean  this is how i was imagining it  anyway  and then i figured  that out of that group  there would be a subset who would go  hmm you know i m really not sure about this section here   and then that group would need it  
 none 	s  it seems like i  if i m right in that  it seems like you re setting it up for the most infrequent case  rather than for the most frequent case 
 none 	so that uh  now we have to worry about privacy  we have to worry about all these passwords  for different people
 none 	well  no fre  for the most  
 none 	for the most frequent case they just say  it s o_k  and then they re done 
 none 	and i think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	the other thing too is it seems like   go ahead 
 none 	um  yeah  that s true 
 none 	i mean  cuz you don t have to visit the web page if you don t want to 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i guess   yeah  i guess we don t need their signature  i guess an email o_k is alright 
 none 	oh that was another thing i   i had assumed that we didn t need their signature  that it   that an email approval was sufficient 
 none 	but i don t actually know 
 none 	are   are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren t speaking 
 none 	yes 
 none 	i also   mm hmm 
 none 	if someone feels strongly enough about it  then i   i   i think they should be allowed to do that 
 none 	uh
 none 	so that means other people are editing what you say 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i don t know about that 
 none 	i don t know if i like that 
 none 	well  the only other choice is that the person would say  no  don t distribute this meeting at all    and i would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say  don t distribute it at all  
 none 	but th  what they signed in the consent form  was something that said you can use my voice 
 none 	well  but if   if someone is having a conversation  and you only bleep out one side of it  that s not sufficient 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  but that s our decision then  right 
 none 	um  i don t think so 
 none 	i mean  because if i object to the conversation  if i say
 none 	i think it is 
 none 	 we were having a conversation  and i consider that conversation private   and i consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer  i wanna be able to bleep out your side 
 none 	the   i agree that the consent forms were   uh  i cons  agree with what adam s saying  that um  the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe  whether they said them or didn t say them 
 none 	i see 
 none 	and the other thing is from the standpoint of the l  of the l  i m not a law  lawyer  but it strikes me that uh  we wouldn t want someone to say  oh yes  i was a little concerned about it but it was too hard to access  
 none 	o_k  well  if that s what it said 
 none 	so i think it s kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it  now   in terms of like editing it by hand  i mean i think it s   i  some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited  but   but it seems to me that sometimes um  you know i  if a person had a bad day  and they had a tone in their voice that they didn t really like  you know it s nice   it s nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was o_k 
 none 	i mean i can certainly provide a printable version if people want it 
 none 	um i mean it s also a mixture of people  i mean some people are r  do their work primarily by sitting at the computer  flipping around the web  and others do not 
 none 	um 
 none 	others would consider it   this uh   a   a set of skills that they would have to gain 
 none 	yep 
 none 	you know  it depends on what meetings 
 none 	well i think most of the people in the meetings are the former 
 none 	that s true 
 none 	so far 
 none 	so 
 none 	in the meetings so far  yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	but we re trying to expand this  right 
 none 	so i   i   i actually think that paper is the more universal thing 
 none 	right 
 none 	and that  
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	well  but if they want to print it out that s alright  i think everyone in the meeting can access the web 
 none 	no  i think we have to be able to print it out  it s not just if they want to print it out  i   i think  
 none 	o_k  so does that mean that i can t use email 
 none 	or what 
 none 	cuz you could send it through email you re thinking 
 none 	i   i th  well   we   there was this  
 none 	well  i don t think i   well i don t think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues 
 none 	good  for security  yeah  o_k good  good point 
 none 	no 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	um 
 none 	so giving them  you think a web site to say   if you wanna print it out here it is   is not sufficient 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i 
 none 	certainly for everybody who s been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient  i m just wondering about  
 none 	yeah  i m just thinking for people that that s not sufficient for  what   the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them 
 none 	you could mail it to them  get an  a mailing address 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	equivalent 
 none 	but  
 none 	but i think it s easier to drop in the box 
 none 	just put the button on   on the web page which say  please send me the   the scripts  
 none 	oh that s interesting 
 none 	that s right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what um   when you display it on the web page  what are   what are you showing them  utterances  or    
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and so can they bleep within an utterance 
 none 	no  whole utterances only 
 none 	whole utterances 
 none 	and that was just convenience for my sake  that it s uh  uh it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub utterance level 
 none 	because this way i can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand 
 none 	there s another aspect to this which maybe   is part of why this is bothering me 
 none 	um  i think you re really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this 
 none 	i mean that s why i did the web form  because for me that would be my most convenient 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	i   i   i understand  i think that s the bad idea 
 none 	i know where you re going 
 none 	oh 
 none 	see because you re gon  you re   uh   really  you re gonna end up with all these little patchy things  whereas really what we want to do is have the   the   the bias towards letting it go 
 none 	because nob  you know it  
 none 	there was a   one or twi  once or twice  in the re  in the meetings we ve heard  where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by  but overall people are talking about technical topics  nobody s gonna get hurt  nobody s being l  libeled 
 none 	you know  this is   this   we re   we re covering   we re playing the lawyer s game  and we re playing  we re   we re   we re looking for the extreme case 
 none 	if we really orient it towards that extreme case  make it really easy  we re gonna end up encouraging a headache 
 none 	that   i think that s  
 none 	i m sort of psyching myself out here  i   i m trying to   uh   but i   i think that s  
 none 	i guess i don t see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu  much of a headache  bleeped out  so 
 none 	well  it s   but i 
 none 	i think what morgan s saying is the easier it is  the more is gonna be bleeped 
 none 	and   and it really depends on what kind of research you re doing 
 none 	i think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there s a bunch of stuff in there that s missing from the dialogue 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	you know  it depends on the kind of research they re doing  but it might be  uh it might be really a   a pain 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  you know where it s really gonna hurt somebody  in some way   the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about  we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out  but i really think we wanna make it the rare incidence 
 none 	and   and uh  i am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do  and so much fun  that they re gonna go through and bleep out stuff  and they can bleep out stuff they don t like too  right from somebody else  as you say  you know  so  well i didn t like what he said  
 none 	so much fun 
 none 	well i don t see any way of avoiding that  i mean  we have to provi  we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don t like 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so that the  
 none 	no  no  i   i   i don t  
 none 	the only question is  
 none 	you  you ve talked me into that  but i   i just think that we should make it harder to do 
 none 	the problem is if it s harder for them it s also harder for me 
 none 	whereas this web interface  i just get email  it s all formatted  it s all ready to go and i can just insert it 
 none 	so maybe you don t give them access to the web interface unless they really need it 
 none 	well i guess  
 none 	so   so   so i m sorry   so   so  
 none 	yeah  hmm 
 none 	so maybe this is a s  a way out of it 
 none 	you ve provided something that s useful for you to do   handle  and useful for someone else if they need it 
 none 	but
 none 	well  
 none 	i think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh  they get access to this if they really need it 
 none 	so you re saying the   the sequence would be more like first adam goes to the contact lists  contacts them via whatever their preferred method is  to see if they want to review the meeting 
 none 	right 
 none 	and then if they don t  you re done  if they do  then he provides them access to the   the web site 
 none 	well  to some extent i have to do that anyway because as i said we have to distribute passwords 
 none 	w  w 
 none 	or   a printed out form 
 none 	there s   there   y  but you don t necessarily have to distribute passwords is what i m saying 
 none 	so 
 none 	well  but   what i m saying is that i can t just email them the password because that s not secure 
 none 	so  
 none 	only if they want it 
 none 	no  no  no  but you aren t necessarily giving them  
 none 	so they have to call me and ask 
 none 	right 
 none 	but   we don t even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all 
 none 	well  we do because of privacy  we can t just make it openly available on the web 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	no  no  you re missing the point 
 none 	we re   we re trying i 
 none 	we re trying to make it less of an obvious just l  l  l  l  uh fall off a log  to do this 
 none 	not everyone gets a password  unless they ask for it  yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	so th  so what i would see  is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the   not just for fun 
 none 	o_k  but to   to check this for uh things that they re worried about having said or if they re willing to just send an approval of it  at   from their memory 
 none 	um   and  uh  and we should think carefully actually we should review   go through how that s worded  o_k 
 none 	then  if someone uh   wants to review it  uh  and i know you don t like this  but i m offering this as a suggestion  is that   is that we then give them a print out 
 none 	and then if they say that  i have a potential problem with these things   then  you   you say  o_k well you might wanna hear this in context to s  think if you need that   you issue them a password  i  in the  
 none 	but the   the problem with what you re suggesting is it s not just inconvenient for them  it s inconvenient for me 
 none 	because that means multiple contacts every time   for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything 
 none 	i would much prefer to have all be automatic  they visit the web site if they want to  obviously they don t have to 
 none 	i know you d prefer it  but the proble  we have   there s a problem with it 
 none 	yeah  so i think you re thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and i just don t think that s gonna happen 
 none 	i m also concerned about the spirit of the   of the informed consent thing  cuz i think if they feel that uh  it s   i th  i th  you know  if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn t detect  then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn t pursue that next level and get the password and do that  um  but   but they might be able to argue  oh well it was cumbersome  and i was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down   so it could that the burden would come back onto us  so i m a little bit worried about uh  making it harder for them  from the legal standpoint 
 none 	well you can go too far in that direction  and you need to find somewhere between i think  because  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it seems to me that sending them email  saying  if you have an o_  o_k reply to this email and say o_k 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	if you have a problem with it contact me and i ll give you a password   seems like is a perfectly  reasonable compromise  and if they want a printout they can print it out themselves 
 none 	or we could print it up for them  i mean we could offer that   but   but there s uh  another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form  um  my impression is that they   that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript  and   and i ha  i don t know that there s a chance of really skipping that stage 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean i   i thought that you were   maybe i misinterpreted what you said but it s  
 none 	having access to it doesn t necessarily mean  that   having it right  it just means they have the right to have it 
 none 	having it  well the in   the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it  so 
 none 	giving it to them  o_k 
 none 	alright  fine  o_k  fair enough 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	sh  sh  well i could   i m closer  i could  
 none 	d  you want me to grab one 
 none 	yeah  but you re wired aren t you 
 none 	yeah  that is true 
 none 	um 
 none 	yeah  i mean i don t wanna fool them 
 none 	i don t know  
 none 	i just meant that e  every   ev  any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a   a bias that is presented  right  of   and  
 none 	oh yeah yeah   oh i know 
 none 	yeah that s true  yeah 
 none 	 if you agree to participate you ll have the opportunity to have anything ex  anything excised  which you would prefer not to have included in the data set  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	 once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r  larger research community  there again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you d prefer to have excised from the database  and they will m  be removed both from the transcript and the recording  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	well that s more open than i realized 
 none 	well  i mean it  
 none 	i  
 none 	the one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	tha  that s true  that s more severe  but the next one says the transcript will be around  and it doesn t really say we ll send it to you  or wi  it ll be available for you on the web  or anything 
 none 	yeah  uh no that   it   tha  that s right 
 none 	i think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them 
 none 	i  i  
 none 	at least it more often  yeah 
 none 	it means also we don t have to g 
 none 	to give it to them  i mean like   like morgan was saying they   they  
 none 	they just have to make sure that it is available to them 
 none 	it s available to them if they ask for it 
 none 	yeah  o_k  so  wh  um   i think i have an idea that may be sat  may satisfy both you and me in this which is  um  it s a   it   we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded 
 none 	so i   i just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre  it gives very  i mean nothing hidden  v  very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data 
 none 	right 
 none 	that   that we really would rather it wasn t a patchwork of things tossed out  that it would be better for  um  our  uh  field if that is the case  but if you really think something is gonna  
 none 	good 
 none 	and i don t think there s anything in the legal aspects that   that is hurt by our expressing that bias 
 none 	great  great  great  yeah  i agree 
 none 	and then   then my concern about   which   you know you might be right  it may be it was just paranoia on my part  uh but people just  
 none 	see i m  worried about this interface so much fun that people start bleeping stuff out just as   just because they can  yeah 
 none 	it s just a check box next to the text  it s not any fun at all 
 none 	well i don t know  i kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out  you know  i  
 none 	well  but they won t get that feedback 
 none 	all   no because it doesn t automatically bleep it at the time  it just sends me  
 none 	oh they won t 
 none 	oh good  so you haven t made it so much fun 
 none 	right 
 none 	oh good  o_k 
 none 	it just sends me the time intervals  and then at some point i ll incorporate them all and put bleeps 
 none 	i mean i don t wanna have t  ha  do that yet until we actually release the data because um  then we have to have two copies of every meeting and we re already short on disk space 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so i   i wanna   i   just keep the times until we actually wanna release the data and then we bleep it 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	alright  so i think  
 none 	yeah so if we have if   i 
 none 	again let s you know  sort of circulate the   the wording on each of these things and get it right  but   but  
 none 	well since you seem to feel heart  uh  strongest about it  would you like to do the first pass 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh  fair enough 
 none 	al 
 none 	turn about is fair play  sorry 
 none 	also it  ther  there is this other question  the legal question that   that adam s raised  uh about whether we need a concrete signature  or email c  i  suffices or whatever and i don t know how that works  i  there s something down there about  if you agree to   
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i m   i m   i m   i thought   i   i thought about it with one of my background processes and i   uh it s   uh it s uh  it s fine to do the email 
 none 	i don t think so 
 none 	ah 
 none 	fine  good  o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah because thi  th  they re signing here that they re agreeing to the paragraph which says
 none 	 you ll be given an opportunity  
 none 	yeah  and  
 none 	and so i don t think they need another signature 
 none 	well and furthermore i   it s now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that i do with people on contracts and so forth that   that uh if it s   if it s that sort of thing where you re you re saying uh  o_k i agree  we want eighty hours of this person at such and such amount  and i agree that s o_k   uh if it s a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it s often done in email now so it s   it s o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	great 
 none 	um 
 none 	so i guess i probably should at the minimum  think about how to present it in a printed form 
 none 	i m not really sure what s best with that  the problem is a lot of them are really short  and so i don t necessarily wanna do one per line 
 none 	well  
 none 	but i don t know how else to do it 
 none 	well i s 
 none 	i also have this   i   i think it s nice you have it uh  viewab  her  hearable on the   on the web for those who might wonder about um  the non  nonverbal side  i mean i   i agree that our bias should be as   as expressed here  and   but
 none 	i   i think it s nice that a person could check  cuz sometimes you know you   the words on a   on the page  come out soun  sounding different in terms of the social dynamics if they hear it  and i realize we shouldn t emphasize that people you know  shouldn t borrow trouble  what it comes down to but  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah i think actually   my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good 
 none 	you know  if   if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that 
 none 	oh  you know  or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn t get detected and there was a whole uh   i  segment a  against some   personal i  th 
 none 	right 
 none 	that was all mumbled  i think microsoft is
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah exactly
 none 	oh 
 none 	sorry transcribers 
 none 	or   or even   or even there was a   a line you know about how
 none 	yeah 
 none 	 hmm mmm mmm bill gates duh duh duh duh   but   but it was all   the words were all visible  but they didn t end up i  some  there was a slip in the transcript 
 none 	oh  god 
 none 	they re gonna hate this meeting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah that s true 
 none 	actually liz will like it  you know  but 
 none 	liz will like it  we had a pretty strong disagreement going there  yeah 
 none 	yep  yep  that s right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so i don t know  i mean  i   i guess we re assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that   that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that it   that nothing will slip by 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but it   the   some  something might sometime  and they   uh   if   if it s something that they said  they might   i  i 
 none 	i mean  you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said  but  when they hear it  themselves  they may hear something different because they know what they meant 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i don t know how to notate that 
 none 	yeah  that s right  yeah that s right 
 none 	sarcasm  how do you   how do you indicate sarcasm 
 none 	no  i m serious 
 none 	so   the   so   i  the   so we might   we might get some feedback from people that such and such was  you know  not   not really what i said 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well that would be good to get  definitely 
 none 	yeah  but 
 none 	yeah  sure 
 none 	just for corrections 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so um  in terms of password distribution  i think phone is really the only way to do it  phone and in person  or mail  physical mail 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	or if for  leave it on their voice mail 
 none 	any sub word level thing 
 none 	any sub wor  yeah  o_k 
 none 	i mean you could do it with p_g_p or things like that but it s too complex 
 none 	you know i just realized something  which is of   e  th  this question about the   uh  the possible mismatch of  
 none 	i mean i  well  and actually also the lawyer saying that um  we shouldn t really have them   have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks  you know 
 none 	i mean  so it s like i  in a way it s   it s nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and   and hear the transcript  to have that be the  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well yeah  but you can t dep 
 none 	i mean  most people will not wanna take the time to do that  though 
 none 	yeah  o_k  fair enough 
 none 	and they re s  they re absorbing the responsibility themselves  so it s not   it s not um   yeah  good 
 none 	and they   they have to  
 none 	but i mean if you were at a meeting  and   and you   you don t think  at least  that you said anything funny and the meeting was about  you know  some   some funny thing about semantics or something  or uh  
 none 	you probably won t listen to it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it is true that tec  that the content is technical  i   and so i  and we re not having these discussions which  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i   i mean  when i listen to these things  i don t find things that are questionable  in other people s speech or in my own 
 none 	yeah  you would think it would be rare  i mean we re not talking about the energy crisis or something  people have  
 none 	just  
 none 	it should be very rare 
 none 	yeah  yeah  o_k 
 none 	how about them energy crises 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think we re uh  
 none 	done 
 none 	kind of done  actually  i was gonna  
 none 	di  did you have anything n  that s going on  or  
 none 	not really  no  um  my project is going along but um  i m really just here to um fill the project uh   the overall progress 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i don t really have anything specific to   to talk about 
 none 	that s fine 
 none 	i just didn t wanna go by you  if you had something 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	hmm  j  i don t know 
 none 	you don t have anything to say 
 none 	nah 
 none 	no 
 none 	transcribers  he was rattling the b  marbles in his brain back and forth just then this   this  
 none 	shall we do digits 
 none 	oh yeah 
 none 	it um
 none 	um  oh by the way i did find a bunch   uh  we should count out how many more digits to forms do we have back there 
 none 	there were quite a few 
 none 	that s what i thought  i f  i was going through them all and i found actually a lot filed in with them  that were blanks  that no one had actually read  and so we still have more than i thought we did  so  we have a few more digits before we re done 
 none 	uh 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	oh good 
 none 	so transcript three zero one one three zero three zero  nine eight five eight
 none 	o_ zero one two zero seven four two four one uh eight six six five four six two two six three seven eight one one six eight eight eight nine eight six nine

 none 	oops 
 none 	you know having this headset reminds me of like working at burger king or something  no i never did 
 none 	i d like a burger with that  do you want fries with that 
 none 	burger king
 none 	oh  did you do that 
 none 	wow 
 none 	but i feel like i could now 
 none 	and
 none 	o_k  we re on 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  i mean  everyone who s on the wireless check that they re on 
 none 	alright 
 none 	c  we  
 none 	i see 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 open_agenda 	o_k  our agenda was quite short  
 none 	oh  could you close the door  maybe  yeah 
 none 	sure  two items  which was  uh  digits and possibly stuff on   on  uh  forced alignment  which jane said that liz and andreas had in  information on  but they didn t  so 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i guess the only other thing  uh  for which i  
 none 	we should do that second  because liz might join us in time for that 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um  o_k  so there s digits  alignments  and  um 
 find_calendar_entry 	i guess the other thing  which i came unprepared for  uh  is  uh  to dis  s  s  see if there s anything anybody wants to discuss about the  saturday   meeting   
 none 	right 
 none 	so 
 none 	any   i mean  maybe not 
 none 	digits and alignments 
 none 	but  
 none 	uh 
 none 	talk about aligning people s schedules 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  i mean   right  yeah  i mean  it was  
 none 	yeah  it s forced alignment of people s schedules 
 none 	yeah  if we re very  
 none 	forced align 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	with   with   whatever it was  a month and a half or something ahead of time  the only time we could find in common   roughly in common  was on a saturday 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	ugh 
 none 	yep 
 none 	it s pretty sad  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	have   have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of   in more of the meeting 
 none 	i   i mean  i don t know  if we had the   if we had the telephone on the table  
 none 	no  but  h  i mean  he probably has to go do something  right 
 none 	no  actually i   i have to   i have to shuttle kids from various places to various other places 
 none 	i see 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  and i don t have   and i don t  um  have a cell phone so i can t be having a conference call while driving 
 none 	a cell phone 
 none 	no  it s not good  that s not good 
 none 	r  r  right  so we have to   we  
 none 	plus  it would make for interesting noise   background noise 
 none 	so we have to equip him with a   with a   with a head mounted  uh  cell phone and  
 none 	yep 
 none 	uh  
 none 	ye  we  and we d have to force you to read lots and lots of digits  so it could get real   real car noise 
 none 	oh  yeah  oh  yeah 
 none 	take advantage 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and with the kids in the background  yeah 
 none 	i ll let   i d let  
 none 	i let  uh  my five year old have a try at the digits  eh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  anyway  i can talk about digits  um  did everyone get the results or shall i go over them again 
 none 	i mean that it was basically   the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well 
 none 	um  and in retrospect that s not as surprising as maybe i  it shouldn t have been as surprising as i   as   as i felt it was 
 none 	the lapel mike is a very high quality microphone 
 none 	and as morgan pointed out  that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling if no one else is talking 
 none 	exactly 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  so  uh  
 none 	it s g  it  
 none 	well  it s   yeah  sort of the bre  the breath noises and the mouth clicks and so forth like that  the lapel s gonna be better on 
 none 	or the cross talk 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the lapel is typically worse on the   on clothes rustling  but if no one s rustling their clothes 
 none 	right  i mean  a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits  so it s   it s a very different task than sort of the natural  so 
 none 	it s   it s  
 none 	yeah  you don t move much during reading digits  i think 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	probably the fact that it picks up other people s speakers   other people s talking is an indication of that it   the fact it is a good microphone 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  right 
 none 	right  so in the digits  in most   most cases  there weren t other people talking  so 
 none 	so 
 none 	d  do the lapel mikes have any directionality to them 
 none 	there typically don t  no 
 none 	because i   i suppose you could make some that have sort of   that you have to orient towards your mouth  and then it would  
 none 	they have a little bit  but they re not noise cancelling  so  uh  
 none 	they re   they re intended to be omni directional 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and th  it s   and because you don t know how people are gonna put them on  you know 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  also  andreas  on that one the   the back part of it should be right against your head 
 none 	and that will he  keep it from flopping aro  up and down as much 
 none 	it is against my head 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 find_calendar_entry 	um   yeah   we  actually talked about this in the  uh   front end   meeting   this morning   too  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	much the same thing  and   and it was   uh  i mean  there the point of interest to the group was primarily that  um  the  uh   the system that we had that was based on h_t_ k  that s used by  you know  all the participants in aurora  was so much worse than the   than the s_r_ i  and the interesting thing is that even though  yes  it s a digits task and that s a relatively small number of words and there s a bunch of digits that you train on  it s just not as good as having a   a l  very large amount of data and training up a   a   a nice good big
 none 	everybody 
 none 	h_m_m  um  also you had the adaptation in the s_r_i system  which we didn t have in this 
 none 	um  so 
 none 	um 
 none 	and we know  
 find_email 	di  did  i  send  you  some  results without adaptation   
 none 	no  or if you did  i didn t include them  cuz it was  
 none 	i  s  i think stephane  uh  had seen them  so  
 none 	yeah  i think i did  actually 
 none 	so there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um 
 none 	a   a   a couple percent or some  i mean  
 none 	well  i don t know it   overall  
 none 	uh  i   i don t remember  but there was   there was a significant  um  loss or win from adaptation   with   with adaptation 
 none 	and  um  that was the phone loop adaptation  and then there was a very small   like point one percent on the natives   uh  win from doing  um  you know  adaptation to the recognition hypotheses 
 none 	and i tried both means adaptation and means and variances  and the variances added another   or subtracted another point one percent  so  it s  um   that s the number there  point six  i believe  is what you get with both  uh  means and variance adaptation 
 none 	right 
 none 	but i think one thing is that  uh  i would presume  
 none 	hav  have you ever t 
 none 	have you ever tried this exact same recognizer out on the actual t_i digits test set 
 none 	this exact same recognizer  no 
 none 	it might be interesting to do that  cuz my   my   cuz my sense  um  
 none 	but   but  i have   i mean  people   people at s_r_i are actually working on digits 
 none 	i bet it would do even slightly better 
 none 	i could   and they are using a system that s  um   you know  h  is actually trained on digits  um  but h  h  otherwise uses the same  you know  decoder  the same  uh  training methods  and so forth  and i could ask them what they get on t_i digits 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  bu  although i d be   i think it d be interesting to just take this exact actual system so that these numbers were comparable and try it out on t_i digits 
 none 	mm hmm  well  adam knows how to run it  so you just make a f 
 none 	yeah  no problem 
 none 	yeah  yeah  yeah  cuz our sense from the other   from the aurora  uh  task is that   i mean  cuz we were getting sub one percent numbers on t_i digits also with the tandem thing  so  one   so there were a number of things we noted from this  one is  yeah  the s_r_i system is a lot better than the h_t_k   this  you know  very limited training h_t_k system 
 none 	and try it with t_i digits 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh  but the other is that  um  the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes  i  uh  are actually a lot harder than the studio recording t_i digits 
 none 	i think  you know  one reason for that  uh  might be that there s still   even though it s close talking  there still is some noise and some room acoustics 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and another might be that  uh  i d   i would presume that in the studio  uh  uh  situation recording read speech that if somebody did something a little funny or n  pronounced something a little funny or made a little   that they didn t include it  they made them do it again 
 none 	they didn t include it 
 none 	whereas  i took out the ones that i noticed that were blatant   that were correctable 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so that  if someone just read the wrong digit  i corrected it  and then there was another one where jose couldn t tell whether   i couldn t tell whether he was saying zero or six  and i asked him and he couldn t tell either 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so i just cut it out 
 none 	you know  so i just e  edited out the first  i  uh  word of the utterance 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  so there s a little bit of correction but it s definitely not as clean as t_i digits 
 none 	so my expectations is t_i digits would  especially  
 none 	i think t_i digits is all american english  right  so it would probably do even a little better still on the s_r_i system  but we could give it a try 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well  but remember  we re using a telephone bandwidth front end here  uh  on this  uh   on this s_r_i system  so  um  i was   i thought that maybe that s actually a good thing because it   it gets rid of some of the   uh  the noises  um  you know  in the   the   below and above the   um  the  you know  speech bandwidth and  um 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher quality recordings you would have to in fact  uh  use models that  uh  were trained on wider band data  and of course we can t do that or  
 none 	wha  what s t_i digits  i thought t 
 none 	it s wide band  yeah  it s   in   in fact  we looked it up and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling 
 none 	it is wide band  o_k 
 none 	oh  that s right  i   i did look that up  i couldn t remember whether that was t_i digits or one of the other digit tasks 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	but   but  i would   yeah  it s   it s easy enough to try  just run it on  
 none 	mm hmm  so  morgan  you re getting a little breath noise  you might wanna move the mike down a little bit 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	see w 
 none 	now  eh  does   one   one issue   one issue with   with that is that um  the system has this  uh  notion of a speaker to   which is used in adaptation  variance norm  uh  you know  both in  uh  mean and variance normalization and also in the v_t_l estimation  so  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  i noticed the script that extracted it 
 none 	do y   
 none 	is    
 none 	so does   so th  so does   does  um  the t_i digits database have speakers that are known 
 none 	yep  yep 
 none 	and is there   is there enough data or a comparable   comparable amount of data to   to what we have in our recordings here 
 none 	that i don t know 
 none 	i don t know 
 none 	i don t know how many speakers there are  and   and how many speakers per utterance 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation 
 none 	that would  
 none 	right  uh  but i m not so much worried about the adaptation  actually  than   than the  um  um   the  uh 
 none 	v_t_l estimation 
 none 	if you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the   the warping  uh  factor  so  um  
 none 	right 
 none 	i strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do 
 none 	right  but it s not the amount of speakers  it s the num  it s the amount of data per speaker 
 none 	so  uh  
 none 	right  so we   we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  
 none 	um 
 none 	so  although i   i sort of know how to run it  there are a little   a f  few details here and there that i ll have to dig out 
 none 	o_k  the key  
 none 	so th  the system actually extracts the speaker i_d from the waveform names 
 none 	right  i saw that 
 none 	and there s a   there s a script   and that is actually all in one script  so there s this one script that parses waveform names and extracts things like the  um  speaker  uh  i_d or something that can stand in as a speaker i_d  so  we might have to modify that script to recognize the  um  speakers  um  in the   in the  uh  um  t_i digits database 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	and that  uh  
 none 	or you can fake   you can fake names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the   for the meetings 
 none 	right 
 none 	that would be the  sort of   probably the safest way to do  
 none 	i might have to do that anyway to   to do   because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about right 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	the other thing is  isn t t_i digits isolated digits 
 none 	right 
 none 	or is that another one  i m   i looked through a bunch of the digits t  corp  corpora  and now they re all blurring 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit 
 none 	and then others were connected digits 
 none 	yeah  most of t_i digits is connected digits  i think  the   i mean  we had a bellcore corpus that we were using  it was   that s   that was isolated digits 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	maybe it s the bell gram  
 none 	bell digits 
 none 	alright 
 none 	um 
 none 	by the way  i think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr  improve them by  um  not starting with the switchboard models but by taking the switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting 
 none 	yep 
 none 	because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics and f  for the far field microphones  you know  to the noise 
 none 	and that should really improve things  um  further 
 none 	and then you use those adapted models  which are not speaker adapted but sort of acous  you know  channel adapted   use that as the starting models for your speaker adaptation 
 none 	channel adapted 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but the thing is  uh   i mean  w  when you   it depends whether you re ju  were just using this as a   a starter task for   you know  to get things going for conversational or if we re really interested i  in connected digits  and i   i think the answer is both 
 none 	well  i don t know 
 none 	and for   for connected digits over the telephone you don t actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation because somebody gets on the phone and says a number and then you just want it 
 none 	this is   this   that one s better  mm hmm 
 none 	you don t   don t  uh  
 none 	right  um  but  you know  i   uh  my impression was that you were actually interested in the far field microphone  uh  problem  i mean  so  you want to   you want to   that s the obvious thing to try  right  then  eh   because you   you don t have any   that s where the most m  acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the   the r  the set up here  so 
 none 	oh  oh 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  so that d be anoth  another interesting data point  i mean  i   i guess i m saying i don t know if we d want to do that as the   as  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	other way  liz  
 none 	other way 
 none 	now you re all watching me  alright  this way 
 none 	it f  it clips over your ears  there you go 
 none 	if you have a strong fe  if you have a strong preference  you could use this  it s just we   we think it has some spikes  so  uh  we   we didn t use that one 
 none 	you re all watching  this is terrible 
 none 	i ll get it 
 none 	but you could if you want  i don t know 
 none 	and andre  andreas  your   your microphone s a little bit low 
 none 	yeah  at any rate  i don t know if w 
 none 	it is  uh 
 none 	yeah  i don t know if we wanna use that as the  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  it pivots 
 none 	so if you see the picture and then you have to scr 
 none 	it   it   like this 
 none 	i  i  
 none 	i   i already adjusted this a number of times  i   i can t quite seem to  
 none 	eh  yeah  i think these mikes are not working as well as i would like 
 none 	yeah  i think this contraption around your head is not working so well 
 none 	too many adju  too many adjustments  yeah 
 none 	anyway  what i was saying is that i   i think i probably wouldn t want to see that as sort of like the norm  that we compared all things to 
 none 	that looks good  yeah 
 none 	to  uh  the   to have   have all this ad  all this  uh  adaptation 
 none 	but i think it s an important data point  if you re   if   yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	um 
 none 	the other thing that   that  uh   of course  what barry was looking at was   was just that  the near versus far  and  yeah  the adaptation would get th  some of that  but  i think even   even if there was  uh  only a factor of two or something  like i was saying in the email  i think that s   that s a big factor  so  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	n 
 none 	liz  you could also just use the other mike if you re having problems with that one 
 none 	well 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  this would be o_k  we   we   we think that this has spikes on it  so it s not as good acoustically  but  
 none 	it s this thing s   this is too big for my head 
 none 	yeah  basically your ears are too big  i mean  mine are too 
 none 	no  my   my   but this is too big for my head  so  i mean  it doesn t   you know  it s sit 
 none 	e  th  everybody s ears are too big for these things 
 none 	uh  
 none 	well  if you d rather have this one then it s  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  well 
 none 	it s great 
 none 	so the  
 none 	to get that  uh  pivoted this way  it pivots like this 
 none 	no this way  yeah 
 none 	yeah  there you go 
 none 	and there s a screw that you can tighten 
 none 	and then it   right 
 none 	right  i already tried to get it close 
 none 	good 
 none 	so if it doesn t bounce around too much  that s actually good placement 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	that looks good 
 none 	but it looks like it s gonna bounce a lot 
 none 	so  where were we  uh   yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	digits  adaptation 
 none 	uh  adaptation  non adaptation  um  factor of two  um  
 none 	what k  u  by the way  wh  what factor of two did you     i mean  
 none 	oh  yeah  i know what i was go  w 
 none 	oh  no  no  it s tha  that   that we were saying  you know  well is   how much worse is far than near  you know  and i mean it depends on which one you re looking at  but for the everybody  it s little under a factor or two 
 none 	oh  th  o_k  that factor of two 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  i   i know what i was thinking was that maybe  uh  i  i  we could actually t  t  try at least looking at  uh  some of the   the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone  at least from the good one 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i mean  before i thought we d get  you know  a hundred and fifty percent error or something  but if   if  uh   if we re getting thirty five  forty percent or something  u  um  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	actually if you run  though  on a close talking mike over the whole meeting  during all those silences  you get  like  four hundred percent word error 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right  i understand  but doing the same kind of limited thing  
 none 	or   or some high number 
 none 	yeah  sure  get all these insertions  but i m saying if you do the same kind of limited thing as people have done in switchboard evaluations or as   a 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	where you know who the speaker is and there s no overlap 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and you do just the far field for those regions 
 none 	yeah  the same sort of numbers that we got those graphs from  right 
 none 	could we do exactly the same thing that we re doing now  but do it with a far field mike 
 none 	yeah  do it with one of   on 
 none 	cuz we extract the times from the near field mike  but you use the acoustics from the far field mike 
 none 	right  i understand that  i just meant that   so you have three choices  there s  um  
 none 	you can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were   were synchronized  or you can do a forced alignment on the close talking to determine that  the  you know  within this segment  these really were the times that this person was talking and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping and just front end those pieces 
 none 	or you can run it on the whole data  which is   which is  you know  a  
 none 	but   but   but how did we get the   how did we determine the links  uh  that we re testing on in the stuff we reported 
 none 	in the h_l_ t paper we took segments that are channel   time aligned  which is now h  being changed in the transcription process  which is good  and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here  because no one else had time   any words in that segment and called that  non overlap  
 none 	and tha 
 none 	and that s what we were getting those numbers from  right 
 none 	yes 
 none 	tho  good   the good numbers  the bad numbers were from the segments where there was overlap 
 none 	well  we could start with the good ones  but anyway   so i think that we should try it once with the same conditions that were used to create those  and in those same segments just use one of the p_z_ms 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  so we   we can do that  yeah 
 none 	and then  you know  i mean  the thing is if we were getting  uh   what  thirty five  forty percent  something like that on   on that particular set  uh  does it go to seventy or eighty  or  does it use up so much memory we can t decode it 
 none 	right 
 none 	it might also depend on which speaker th  it is and how close they are to the p_z_m  i don t know how different they are from each other 
 none 	uh  
 none 	you want to probably choose the p_z_m channel that is closest to the speaker 
 none 	to be best   f 
 none 	for this particular digit ones  i just picked that one 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  
 none 	o_k  so we would then use that one  too  or    
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	so  
 none 	this is kind of central 
 none 	you know  it s   so i  but i would   i d pick that one  it ll be less good for some people than for other  but i   i d like to see it on the same   exact same data set that   that we did the other thing on  right 
 none 	actually  
 none 	i sh  actually should ve picked a different one  because that could be why the p_d_a is worse 
 none 	because it s further away from most of the people reading digits 
 none 	it s further away  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s probably one of the reasons 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well  yeah  you could look at  i guess  that p_z_m or something 
 none 	yep 
 none 	but the other is  it s very  uh   i mean  even though there s   i m sure the f  f  the   the s_r_i  uh  front end has some kind of pre emphasis  it s   it s  uh   still  th  it s picking up lots of low frequency energy  so  even discriminating against it  i m sure some of it s getting through 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um 
 none 	but  yeah  you re right  prob  a part of it is just the distance 
 none 	and aren t these pretty bad microphones 
 none 	well  they re bad 
 none 	yep 
 none 	i mean  
 none 	but  i mean  if you listen to it  it sounds o_k  you know  u  yeah 
 none 	yeah  when you listen to it  uh  the p_z_m and the p_d_a   yeah  th  the p_d_a has higher sound floor but not by a lot  it s really pretty   uh  pretty much the same 
 none 	i just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose 
 none 	cheap in terms of their quality  so 
 none 	well  they re twenty five cents or so  yeah 
 none 	th  we wanted them to be   to be typical of what would be in a p_d_a  so they are   they re not the p_z_m three hundred dollar type  they re the twenty five cent  buy them in packs of thousand type 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i see 
 none 	but  i mean  the thing is people use those little mikes for everything because they re really not bad 
 none 	everything 
 none 	i mean  if you re not doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer  they   they   they   you know  you can hear the sou  hear the sounds just fine  you know  it s  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	they   i mean  i  it s more or less the same principles as these other mikes are built under  it s just that there s less quality control 
 none 	they just  you know  churn them out and don t check them 
 none 	um 
 none 	so 
 none 	so that was   yeah  so that was i  interesting result  so like i said  the front end guys are very much interested in   in this is as   as well and
 none 	so   so  but where is this now  i mean  what s   where do we go from here  i mean  we   so we have a   we have a   a system that works pretty well but it s not  you know  the system that people here are used to using   to working with  so what   what do we do now 
 none 	yeah  that was gonna be my question 
 none 	well  i think what we wanna do is we want to   eh  and we ve talked about this in other contexts   we want to have the ability to feed it different features 
 none 	mm hmm  o_k 
 none 	and then  um  from the point of view of the front end research  it would be s  uh  substituting for h_t_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i think that s the key thing  and then if we can feed it different features  then we can try all the different things that we re trying there 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	alright 
 none 	and then  um  uh  also dave is   is thinking about using the data in different ways  uh  to um  uh  explicitly work on reverberation starting with some techniques that some other people have found somewhat useful  and   yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so   so the key thing that s missing here is basically the ability to feed  you know  other features i  into the recognizer and also then to train the system 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k  and  uh  es  i don t know when chuck will be back but that s exactly what he   he s gonna  
 none 	h  h 
 none 	he s   he s sort of back  but he drove for fourteen hours an  and wasn t gonna make it in today 
 none 	oh  o_k  so 
 none 	i think that s one of the things that he said he would be working on  um 
 none 	just sort of t  to make sure that we can do that and  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um 
 none 	right 
 none 	it s   uh  i mean  the   the front end is f  i  tha  that s in the s_r_i recognizer is very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly but it unfortunately is not designed and  um   like the  uh  icsi system is  where you can feed it from a pipeline of   of the command  so  the   what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to  uh  dump out  um   you know  if you want to use some new features  you have to dump them into individual files and give those files to the recognizer 
 none 	we do   we tend to do that anyway 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh  so  although you   you can pipe it as well  we tend to do it that way because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep re doing it over and over 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	alright 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  so i ve   i  
 none 	so tha  that s exactly what the p_file is for 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  the   the   the cumbersome thing is   is  um   is that you actually have to dump out little   little files  so for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out a separate file 
 none 	uh  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	just like i  th  like th  as if there were these waveform segments  but instead you have sort of feature file segments 
 none 	but  you know  
 none 	so 
 none 	cool 
 none 	o_k  so the s  the   the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yes  we have  
 none 	i don t know  did you wanna talk about it  or    
 none 	i can give a   i was just telling this to jane and   and  
 none 	w  we   we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring and um  some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition  which is a um 
 none 	i think was both a   a pruning problem and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations  and so we tried both of these st  things  we tried saying  
 none 	i don t know  i got this whacky idea that   just from looking at the data  that when people talk their words are usually chunked together 
 none 	it s not that they say one word and then there s a bunch of words together 
 none 	they re might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels 
 none 	but in general  if there s  like  five or six words and one word s far away from it  that s probably wrong on average  so  um  
 none 	and then also  ca  the pruning  of course  was too   too severe 
 none 	so that s actually interesting  the pruning was the same value that we used for recognition 
 none 	and we had lowered that   we had used tighter pruning after liz ran some experiments showing that  you know  it runs slower and there s no real difference in  
 none 	no gain 
 none 	actually it was better with   slightly better or about th  it was the same with tighter pruning 
 none 	right 
 none 	so for free recognition  this   the lower pruning value is better  you  
 none 	it s probably cuz the recognition s just bad en  at a point where it s bad enough that   that you don t lose anything 
 none 	correct 
 none 	right 
 none 	um  but it turned out for   for   to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly 
 none 	right 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	um because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment  um  in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  so that was one big factor that helped improve things and then the other thing was that  you know  as liz said the   we f  enforce the fact that  uh  the foreground speech has to be continuous  it cannot be   you cannot have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech  you can only have background speech at the beginning and the end 
 none 	yeah  i mean  yeah  it isn t always true  and i think what we really want is some clever way to do this  where  um  you know  from the data or from maybe some hand corrected alignments from transcribers that things like words that do occur just by themselves a  alone  like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it   those would be able to do that  but the rest would be constrained 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	sorry 
 none 	so  i think we have a version that s pretty good for the native speakers  i don t know yet about the non native speakers 
 none 	and  um  we basically also made noise models for the different   sort of grouped some of the mouth noises together 
 none 	um  so  and then there s a background speech model 
 none 	and we also  
 find_calendar_entry 	there was some neat   or  interesting cases  like there s one  meeting  where  um  jose s giving a presentation and he s talking about  um  the word  mixed signal  and someone didn t understand  uh  that you were saying   mixed    
 none 	i think  morgan 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	and so your speech  ch was s  saying something about mixed signal  and the next turn was a lot of people saying  mixed   like  he means mixed signal  or  i think it s mixed   and the word  mixed  in this segment occurs  like  a bunch of times 
 none 	sh 
 none 	and chuck s on the lapel here  and he also says  mixed  but it s at the last one  and of course the aligner th  aligns it everywhere else to everybody else s  mixed   cuz there s no adaptation yet  so there s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think there s some issues about   u 
 none 	we probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker  but  i guess andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker  and that s actually a little bit of a f  funky model  like  it gives you some weird alignments  just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker  so there s some things there  especially when you get lots of the same words  uh  occurring in the  
 none 	oh  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh 
 none 	well  the  
 none 	i   i think you can do better by uh  cloning   so we have a reject phone 
 none 	and you   and what we wanted to try with   you know  once we have this paper written and have a little more time  uh  t  cloning that reject model and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground  like fragments and stuff  and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker 
 none 	right  i mean  in general we actually  
 none 	and  
 none 	right now the words like partial words are reject models and you normally allow those to match to any word  but then the background speech was also a reject model  and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between   you know  it needs to differentiate between the two  so just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	and another one is turns  like people starting with
 none 	 well i think  and someone else is  well how about   so the word  well  is in this   in this segment multiple times  and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it 
 none 	but then that constraint of sort of   uh  proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general 
 none 	is the proximity constraint a hard constraint  or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance  or    
 none 	we   we didn t   no  we   w 
 none 	right now it s a kluge 
 none 	o_k  we   it s straightforward to actually just have a   a penalty that doesn t completely disallows it but discourages it 
 none 	but  um  we just didn t have time to play with  you know  tuning yet another   yet another parameter 
 none 	the ve  level  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and really the reason we can t do it is just that we don t have a   we don t have ground truth for these  so  we would need a hand marked  um  word level alignments or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech betw  you know  between the speakers 
 none 	um  and then use that as a reference and tune the parameters of the   of the model  uh  to op  to get the best performance 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	g  given   i   i mean  i wa  i wa  i was gonna ask you anyway  uh  how you assessed that things were better 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i looked at them  i spent two days   um  in waves  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh  it was painful because the thing is  you know the alignments share a lot in common  so  
 none 	and you re   yo  you re looking at these segments where there s a lot of speech  i mean  a lot of them have a lot of words 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	not by every speaker but by some speaker there s a lot of words 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	ju 
 none 	no  not   i mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don t see a lot of words  but altogether you ll see a lot of words up there  and so the reject is also mapping and pauses  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so i looked at them all in waves and just lined up all the alignments  and  at first it sort of looked like a mess and then the more i looked at it  i thought  o_k  well it s moving these words leftward and   
 none 	you know  it wasn t that bad  it was just doing certain things wrong  so   but  i don t  you know  have time to l  to look at all of them and it would be really useful to have  like  a   a transcriber who could use waves  um  just mark  like  the beginning and end of the foreground speaker s real words   like  the beginning of the first word  the end of the last word   and then we could  you know  do some adjustments 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i   o_k  i have to ask you something  which is  first of all  um  is i  does it have to be waves  because if we could benefit from what you did  incorporate that into the present transcripts  that would help 
 none 	no 
 none 	and then  um  the other thing is  i believe that i did hand 
 none 	so  one of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber and then i hand marked it myself so that we do have  uh  the beginning and ending of individual utterances 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  i didn t do it word level  but   but in terms   so i   so for   for one of the n_s_ a groups  and also i went back to the original one that i first transcribed and   and did it w  uh  w  uh  utterance by utterance for that particular one  so i think you do have   if that s a sufficient unit  i think that you do have hand marking for that  but it d be wonderful to be able to benefit from your waves stuff 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	we don t care what   what tool you use 
 none 	o_k  i used it in transcriber and it s   it s in the  
 none 	yeah  i mean  if   if you can  um   if you wanna   well  jane and i were   just in terms of the tool  talking about this  i guess sue had had some reactions  you know  interface wise if you re looking at speech  you wanna be able to know really where the words are  and so  we can give you some examples of sort of what this output looks like  um  and see if you can in  maybe incorporate it into the transcriber tool some way  or  
 none 	u  uh  
 none 	yeah  that s right  middle of the word  or  
 none 	well  i th  i m thinking just ch  e  e  incorporating it into the representation  i mean  if it s   if it s   if you have start points  if you have  like  time tags  which is what i assume  isn t that what   what you     well  see  adam would be  
 none 	um 
 none 	you mean like   yeah  word start insights 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  whatever you use  i mean  we convert it to this format that the  um  nist scoring tool unders  uh  c_t_m 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	conversation time marked file  and   and then that s the   that s what the  
 none 	i think transcriber  uh  outputs c_t_m 
 none 	if it     o_k  so you would know this more than i would 
 none 	i think so 
 none 	yeah  so  i mean  
 none 	right 
 none 	it seems like she   if she s g  if she s moving time marks around  since our representation in transcriber uses time marks  it seems like there should be some way of   of using that   benefitting from that 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  it wou  the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able   if you were zoomed in enough in transcriber to see all the words  you would be able to  like  have the words sort of located in time  if you wanted to do that  so 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so   so if we e  e  even just had a   a   it sounds like w  we   we almost do 
 none 	uh  if we   we have two  yeah 
 none 	we have two 
 none 	just ha  uh  trying out the alignment procedure that you have on that you could actually get something  um   uh  uh  get an objective measure 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh  
 none 	you mean on   on the hand marked  um  
 none 	so we   we only r  hav  i only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose  i think m_r four  just randomly  um  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  
 none 	actually  not randomly  we knew   we knew that it had these insertion errors from   yeah 
 none 	not randomly  
 find_calendar_entry 	it had sort of average recognition performance in a bunch of speakers and it was a  meeting recorder   meeting   
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  but  yeah  we should try to use what you have  i did re run recognition on your new version of
 none 	oh  good  good 
 none 	m_r one  i   i mean the   the one with  dan ellis  in it and  eric  
 none 	uh huh  yeah  exactly  yeah  yeah 
 none 	i don t think that was the new version 
 none 	um  
 none 	that   yeah  actually it wasn t the new new  it was the medium new  but   but we would   we should do the   the latest version  it was the one from last week 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  you   did you adjust the   the utterance times  um  for each channel 
 none 	yes 
 none 	yes  i did  and furthermore  i found that there were a certain number where   not   not a lot  but several times i actually moved an utterance from adam s channel to dan s or from dan s to adam s  so there was some speaker identif 
 none 	and the reason was because i transcribed that at a point before   uh  before we had the multiple audio available f  so i couldn t switch between the audio  i   i transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely  which meant in overlaps  i was at a   at a terrific disadvantage 
 none 	right  right 
 none 	in addition it was before the channelized  uh  possibility was there  and finally i did it using the speakers of my  um   of   you know  off the c_p_u on my   on my machine cuz i didn t have a headphone 
 none 	so it    like  i mean  
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  i   i mean  i  in retrospect it would ve been good to ha  have got  i should ve gotten a headphone 
 none 	but in any case  um  thi  this is   this was transcribed in a   in a  uh  less optimal way than   than the ones that came after it  and i was able to   you know  an  and this meant that there were some speaker identif  identifications which were changes  yeah 
 none 	well  i know there were some speaker labeling problems  um  after interruptions  is that what you re referring to 
 none 	fixed that 
 none 	oh  well  
 none 	i mean  cuz there s this one instance when  for example  you re running down the stairs  i remember this meeting really well 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	don   don has had   he knows   he can just read it like a play 
 none 	right  it s a  
 none 	yeah  i ve   i ve   i m very well acquainted with this meeting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i can s 
 none 	 and then she said  and then he said  
 none 	yeah  i know it by heart  so  um  there s one point when you re running down the stairs  right  and  like  there s an interruption 
 none 	uh oh 
 none 	you interrupt somebody  but then there s no line after that  for example  there s no speaker identification after that line 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	is that what you re talking about  or were there mislabelings as far as  like  the a  adam was    
 none 	that was fixed  um  before   i  i  i  i think i  i think i understood that pretty   thank you for mentioning  yeah  no  tha  that  
 none 	yeah  cuz i thought i let you know about that  yeah 
 none 	that i think went away a couple of versions ago  but it s good to know 
 none 	o_k  but you re actually saying that certain  uh  speakers were mis  mis identified 
 none 	yeah  so  with   under   um  uh  listening to the mixed channel  there were times when  as surprising as that is 
 none 	i got adam s voice confused with dan s and vice versa   not for long utterances  but jus  just a couple of places  and embedde  embedded in overlaps  the other thing that was w  interesting to me was that i picked up a lot of  um  backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal  which  you know  i mean  you c  not   not too surprising 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	but the other thing that  
 none 	i   i hadn t thought about this  but i thou  i wanted to raise this when you were   uh  with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially  but that s  
 none 	when i was looking at these backchannels  they were turning up usually   very often in   w  well  i won t say  usually    but anyway  very often  i picked them up in a channel w  which was the person who had asked a question  s  so  like  someone says  an  and have you done the so and so  
 none 	and then there would be backchannels  but it would be the person who asked the question  other people weren t really doing much backchanneling 
 none 	and  you know  sometimes you have the   yeah  uh huh 
 none 	well  that s interesting 
 none 	i mean  i  it wouldn t be perfect  but   but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when   when you re somehow involved in the topic  and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	no  that s really interesting 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well 
 none 	that s interesting 
 none 	i think   no  i think it s   actually i think what s going on is backchanneling is something that happens in two party conversations  and if you ask someone a question  you essentially initiating a little two party conversation 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  actu  yeah  when we looked at this  
 none 	so then you re   so and then you re expected to backchannel because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody 
 none 	exactly 
 none 	exactly 
 none 	exactly my point  an  and so this is the expectation thing that   uh  uh  just the dyadic   but in addition  you know  if someone has done this analysis himself and isn t involved in the dyad  but they might also give backchannels to verify what   what the answer is that this   that the   the answerer s given  
 none 	yeah  yeah  right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	h 
 none 	i tell you  i say   i say  uh huh  a lot  while people are talking to each other 
 none 	right  it s  
 none 	there you go 
 none 	well  but it s interesting cuz  uh  
 none 	there you go  yeah  yeah 
 none 	but there are fewer   i think there are fewer  uh huhs   i mean  just from   we were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between in doing the alignment 
 none 	you know the ones we wouldn t constrain to be next to the other words 
 none 	oh  yeah 
 none 	and
 none 	 uh huh  is not as frequent as it sort of would be in switchboard  if you looked at just a word frequency list of one word short utterances  and   yeah   is way up there  but not  uh huh   and so i was thinking thi  it s not like you re being encouraged by everybody else to keep talking in the meeting  and uh  that s all  i  i ll stop there  cuz i  i think what you say makes a lot of sense  but it was sort of  
 none 	well  that s right  and that would  
 none 	well  an 
 none 	and what you say is the   is the re  uh  o  other side of this  which is that  you know  so th  there are lots of channels where you don t have these backchannels  w  when a question has been asked and   and these  
 none 	right  there s just probably less backchanneling in general  even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting  but we ll find out anyway  we were   i guess the other thing we re   we re   i should say is that we re gonna  um try   compare this type of overlap analysis to switchboard  where   and callhome  where we have both sides  so that we can try to answer this question of  you know  is there really more overlap in meetings or is it just because we don t have the other channel in switchboard and we don t know what people are doing 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so that s good news  really 
 none 	and callhome 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	try to create a paper out of that 
 none 	yeah  i mean  y  y  you folks have probably already told me  but were   were you intending to do a eurospeech submission  or    
 none 	um  you mean the one due tomorrow 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  well  we re still  like  writing the scripts for doing the research  and we will   yes  we re gonna try 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and i was telling don  do not take this as an example of how people should work 
 none 	do as i say  don t do as i do  yeah 
 none 	that s r 
 none 	so  we will try  it ll probably be a little late  but i m gonna try it 
 none 	well  
 none 	it is different  in previous years  eurospeech only had the abstract due by now  not the full paper 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	and so all our timing was off  i ve given up on trying to do digits  i just don t think that what i have so far makes a eurospeech paper 
 none 	well  i m no  we may be in the same position  and i figured we ll try  because that ll at least get us to the point where we have   we have this really nice database format that andreas and i were working out that  
 none 	it   it s not very fancy  it s just a
 none 	ascii line by line format  but it does give you information  
 none 	it s the   it s the spurt format 
 none 	it   yeah  we re calling these  spurts  after chafe  i was trying to find what s a word for a continuous region with pauses around it 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah  i know that th  the telecom people use   use  spurt  for that  yes 
 none 	good 
 none 	they do  oh  oh  i would jus 
 none 	oh 
 none 	and that s   i mean  i   i was using that for a while when i was doing the rate of speech stuff  because i   because i looked up in some books and i found   o_k  i wanna find a spurt in which   and   an  because   cuz it s another question about how many pauses they put in between them  but how fast do they do the words within the spurt  yeah 
 none 	ah  right 
 none 	it s just  like  defined by the acoustics 
 none 	horrible 
 none 	right 
 none 	you know   burst   also  isn t  burst  is used also 
 none 	right  well  that s what we were calling spurt  so  
 none 	it s gonna   burst 
 none 	spurt has the horrible name overloading with other   with hardware at icsi 
 none 	here   
 none 	here  just very locally  yeah  but   but that just  
 none 	well  well  chafe had this wor  i think it was chafe  or somebody had a   the word  spurt  originally  and so i  
 none 	actually  
 none 	but tha  that s good to know  was thi  it s chafe 
 none 	well  see  i know s  sue wrote about spurts of development  but  in any case  i think it s a good term  and  uh  
 none 	so maybe we should talk  
 none 	maybe it was sue     y 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so we have spurts and we have spurt ify dot shell and spurt ify
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and ma  maybe   maybe chafe did  i know   i know ch  chafe dealt with  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  so s 
 none 	that s cool 
 none 	and then it s got all   it s a verb now 
 none 	w  uh  w 
 none 	chafe speaks about intonation units 
 none 	yes  right 
 none 	but maybe he speaks about spurts as well and i just don t know  yeah  go ahead 
 none 	we 
 none 	so what we re doing   uh  this   this is just   maybe someone has s  some   some ideas about how to do it better  but we  
 none 	i ve heard  burst  also 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	so we re taking these  uh  alignments from the individual channels 
 none 	we re   from each alignment we re producing  uh  one of these c_t_m files  which essentially has   it s just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration 
 none 	great 
 none 	and   and   and of course  
 none 	it looks like a waves label file almost  right  it s just  
 none 	right  but it has   one   the first column has the meeting name  so it could actually contain several meetings  um 
 none 	and the second column is the channel 
 none 	third column is the  um  start times of the words and the fourth column is the duration of the words 
 none 	and then we re  um  
 none 	o_k  then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of words the  uh  tags for  like  where   where sentence   ends of sentence  question marks  um  various other things  uh 
 none 	yeah  these are things that we had don   so  don sort of  um  propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber   so whether it was  like  question mark or period or  um  you know  comma and things like that  and we kept the   and disfluency dashes   uh  kept those in because we sort of wanna know where those are relative to the spurt overlaps   sp  overlaps  or  
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right  so   so those are actually sort of retro fitted into the time alignment 
 none 	and then we merge all the alignments from the various channels and we sort them by time 
 none 	and then there s a   then there s a process where you now determine the spurts 
 none 	that is  
 none 	actually  no  you do that before you merge the various channels  so you   you id  identify by some criterion  which is pause length   you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts  and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and then you merge everything in terms of  you know  linearizing the sequence based on the time marks 
 none 	and then you extract the individual channels again  but this time you know where the other people start and end talking   you know  where their spurts start and end 
 none 	and so you extract the individual channels  uh  one sp  spurt by spurt as it were 
 none 	um  and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end tags for overlaps  so  you   you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers  speech 
 none 	right 
 none 	uh  i mean  i think that s actually really u  useful also because even if you weren t studying overlaps  if you wanna get a transcription for the far field mikes  how are you gonna know which words from which speakers occurred at which times relative to each other  you have to be able to get a transcript like   like this anyway  just for doing far field recognition  so  you know  it s   it s sort of  
 none 	and  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i thi  it s just an issue we haven t dealt with before  how you time align things that are overlapping anyway 
 none 	that s wonderful 
 none 	so  
 none 	well  
 none 	and   and we  
 none 	i mean  i  i never thought about it before  but  
 none 	y  yes  i mean  s  when i came up with the original data   suggested data format based on the transcription graph  there s capability of doing that sort of thing in there 
 none 	in  
 none 	right  but you can t get it directly from the transcription  yeah  this is like a poor man s ver  formatting version  but it s  you know   it s clean  it s just not fancy 
 none 	mm hmm  yeah  that s right 
 none 	right  well  this is   this is just  
 none 	well  there s lots of little things  it s like there re twelve different scripts which you run and then at the end you have what you want  but  um  at the very last stage we throw away the actual time information  all we care about is whether   that there s a certain word was overlapped by someone else s word 
 none 	right 
 none 	um 
 none 	so you sort of   at that point  you discretize things into just having overlap or no overlap 
 none 	because we figure that s about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but if you wanted to do a more fine grained analysis and say  you know  how far into the word is the overlap  you could do that  it s just   it ll just require more   you know  slightly different  
 none 	yeah  just sort of huge 
 none 	what s interesting is it s exactly what  um  i  in discussing with  um  sue about this  um  she  um  i  i  i  indicated that that   you know  that s very important for overlap analysis 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  it s   it s nice to know  and also i think as a human  like  i don t always hear these in the actual order that they occur  so i can have two foreground speakers  you know  morgan an  and um  adam and jane could all be talking  and i could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time  and then look where they are relative to each other  and that s not really what i heard 
 none 	right 
 none 	and that s another thing she said  this is   this is bever s   bever s effect  when   where  
 none 	cuz it s just hard to do 
 none 	y  yeah  it s sort of  
 none 	in psy  ps  psycho linguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases a  as to what they hear  that   that  
 none 	yeah  you sort of move things around until you get to a low information point and yo  then you can bring in the other person  so it s actually not even possible  i think  for any person to listen to a mixed signal  even equalize  and make sure that they have all the words in the right order 
 none 	not the best  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so  i guess  we ll try to write this eurospeech paper  i mean  we will write it  whether they accept it late or not  i don t know 
 none 	superb 
 none 	um  and the good thing is that we have   it s sort of a beginning of what don can use to link the prosodic features from each file to each other 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  that s the good thing about these pape 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	plus  mayb 
 none 	so  i  you know  might as well  we  i ju  otherwise we won t get the work done on our deadline 
 none 	i don t know  m 
 none 	i mean  u  u  jane likes to look at data  maybe  you know  you could   you could look at this format and see if you find anything interesting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i don t know 
 none 	yeah  no  it s   that s the good thing about these pape  paper deadlines and  uh  you know  class projects  and   and things like that  because you   you really get g  yeah 
 none 	well  what i m thinking is  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	well  my  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well th  th  the other thing that   that   that yo  that you usually don t tell your graduate students is that these deadlines are actually not that  um  you know  strictly enforced  because the   because   bec  b  nah   i  because these   the conference organizers actually have an interest in getting lots of submissions  i mean  a   a monetary interest  so  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	forces you to do the work  exactly 
 none 	strict 
 none 	oh  now it s out in the public  this   this   this secret information  yeah 
 none 	i think we can ha 
 none 	right  so  
 none 	no 
 none 	no 
 none 	nah 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um 
 none 	th  that s   that s true 
 none 	and good ones  good ones  which sometimes means a little extra time 
 none 	and good submission  right  well  
 none 	that s  
 none 	that s true 
 none 	that s another issue  but  
 none 	by th  by the way  this is totally unfair  you may   you may feel  but the   the  uh   the morning meeting folks actually have an   an extra month or so 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yep  the aurora   there s a special aurora  
 none 	when  
 none 	uh  
 none 	there s a special aurora session and the aurora pe  people involved in aurora have till ma  uh  early may or something to turn in their paper 
 none 	oh 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	oh 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	well  then you can just  
 none 	oh  well maybe we ll submit to s  actually  
 none 	maybe you can submit the digits paper on e  for the aurora session 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  i could  i could submit that to aurora  that would be pretty   pretty  
 none 	i  if it w 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well   i  it has  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	s  that wouldn t work  it s not aurora 
 none 	no  it wouldn t work  it s   it s not the aurora   i mean  it   it s   it s actually the aurora task 
 none 	maybe they ll get s 
 none 	aurora s very specific 
 none 	it 
 none 	well  maybe it won t be after this deadline extension  maybe they ll  
 none 	but   but the people   i mean  a   a paper that is not on aurora would probably be more interesting at that point because everybody s so sick and tired of the aurora task 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  i thought you meant this was just the digits section  i didn t know you meant it was aurora digits 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  no  if you   if you have   it s to   if you discuss some relation to the aurora task  like if you use the same  
 none 	this is not the aurora task 
 none 	so they just do a little grep for  
 none 	do   uh  d  d 
 none 	um 
 none 	do not   do not   we are not setting a good example  this is not a  
 none 	well  a relation other than negation  maybe  um 
 none 	so  i don t know 
 none 	anyway 
 none 	but the good thing is this does  
 none 	well  i  i don t know  i mean  you could   you could do a paper on what s wrong with the aurora task by comparing it to other ways of doing it 
 none 	how well does an aurora system do on   on   you know  on digits collected in a   in this environment  yeah 
 none 	different way  yeah 
 none 	maybe 
 none 	maybe 
 none 	pretty hokey 
 none 	i think it s a littl  little far fetched  nah  i mean  the thing is aurora s pretty closed community  i mean  you know  the people who were involved in the   the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who   who made it above a certain threshold in the first round  uh w  in ninety nine and it s   it s sort of a   it s   not like a  
 none 	yep 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	it s very specific 
 none 	well  that s maybe why they don t f  know that they have a crummy system  i mean  a crummy back end 
 none 	no  i mean   i mean  seriously  if you   if you have a very  
 none 	no  i m sorry 
 none 	uh   beep   bee  
 none 	no  i didn t mean anybody   any particular system  i meant this h_t_ k back end  if they  
 none 	i mean  th 
 none 	oh  you don t like h_t_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i don t h  i don t have any stock in h_t_k or entropic or anything 
 none 	no  i mean  this   it  it s the h_t_k that is trained on a very limited amount of data  yeah 
 none 	it s d  it s very specific 
 none 	right 
 none 	but so  if you  
 none 	but maybe you should  you know  consider more   using more data  or   i mean  
 none 	oh  yeah  i   i really think that that s true 
 none 	and they i  i  i 
 none 	if yo  if you sort of hermetically stay within one task and don t look left and right  then you re gonna  
 none 	but they   they had  
 none 	but  
 none 	they had something very specific in mind when they designed it 
 none 	right 
 none 	well  u  i 
 none 	right  and so   so you can   you can argue about maybe that wasn t the right thing to do  but  you know  they   they   they had something specific 
 none 	but  one of the reasons i have chuck s messing around with   with the back end that you re not supposed to touch  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i mean  for the evaluations  yes  we ll run a version that hasn t been touched 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but  uh  one of the reasons i have him messing around with that  because i think it s sort of an open question that we don t know the answer to  people always say very glibly that i  if you s  show improvement on a bad system  that doesn t mean anything  cuz it may not be   show   uh  because  you know  it doesn t tell you anything about the good system 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and i   i ve always sort of felt that that depends 
 none 	you know  that if some peopl  if you re actually are getting at something that has some conceptual substance to it  it will port 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and in fact  most methods that people now use were originally tried with something that was not their absolute best system at some level 
 none 	but of course  sometimes it doesn t  uh  port  so i think that s   that s an interesting question  if we re getting three percent error on  uh  u  uh  english  uh  nati  native speakers  um  using the aurora system  and we do some improvements and bring it from three to two  do those same improvements bring  uh  th  you know  the s_r_i system from one point three to   you know  to point eight  well  you know  so that s   that s something we can test 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	zero 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	so 
 none 	anyway 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i think we ve   we ve covered that one up extremely well 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	whew 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  um  
 none 	yeah  so tha  so we ll   you know  maybe you guys ll have   have one  uh  you   you and  uh   and dan have   have a paper that   that s going in  you know  that s   that s pretty solid  on the segmentation stuff 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	yeah  i will send you the   the final version  which is not  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and the aurora folks here will   will definitely get something in on aurora  so 
 none 	actually this   this  um   so  there s another paper  it s a eurospeech paper but not related to meetings 
 none 	but it s on digits  so  um  uh  a colleague at s_r_i developed a improved version of m_m_i_e training 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	and he tested it mostly on digits because it s sort of a   you know  it doesn t take weeks to train it 
 none 	right 
 none 	um 
 none 	and got some very impressive results  um  with  you know  discriminative  uh  gaussian training 
 none 	um  you know  like  um  error rates go from   i don t know  in very noisy environment  like from  uh  uh  
 none 	i for  now i   o_k  now i have the order of magnit  i m not sure about the order of magnitude  was it like from ten percent to eight percent or from e  e  you know  point   you know  from one percent to point eight percent  i mean  it s a  
 none 	h  i  it got   it got better  yeah  yeah 
 none 	it got better  that s the important thing  yeah  but it s  
 none 	hey  that s the same percent relative  so  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  right  it s  uh  something in   right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	twenty percent relative gain 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 find_calendar_entry 	um  let s see  i think the only thing we had left was   unless somebody else   well  there s a couple things   uh  one is anything that  um  anybody has to say about  saturday    anything we should do in prep for saturday 
 none 	um  
 none 	i guess everybody knows about  
 none 	i mean  u  um  mari was asking   was trying to come up with something like an agenda and we re sort of fitting around people s times a bit 
 none 	but  um  clearly when we actually get here we ll move things around this  as we need to  but   so you can t absolutely count on it  but   but  uh  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	are we meeting in  here  probably or     o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that was my thought  i think this is   u  no  i   i hadn t in  intended to  we won  we wanna   i mean  they re   there s gonna be  uh   jeff    katrin    mari  and  two students   so there s five from there 
 none 	are we recording it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we won t have enough microphones  but  
 none 	there s no way 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and  brian  
 none 	but you know th 
 none 	and  brian s  coming  so that s six 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and plus  all of us  
 none 	can use the oprah mike 
 none 	uh  
 none 	depends how fast you can throw it  it s just  
 none 	it seems like too many   too much coming and going 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  
 none 	we don t even have enough channel  
 none 	because it would be a different kind of meeting  that s what i m  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  
 none 	i hadn t really thought of it  but  
 none 	maybe just   maybe not the whole day but just  you know  maybe some   i mean  part of it 
 none 	maybe part of it 
 none 	maybe part of it 
 none 	make everyone read digits 
 none 	at the same time 
 none 	at the same time 
 none 	at the same time 
 none 	please 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we c 
 none 	i don t know  any 
 none 	that s their initiation into our w 
 none 	into our   our   our cult 
 none 	yeah  our   yeah  our  
 none 	maybe the sections that are not right afte  you know  after lunch when everybody s still munching and  
 none 	o_k  well  
 none 	so can you send out a schedule once you know it  jus   
 none 	o_k  yeah  i guess i sent it around a little bit  but  
 none 	is   is there a r    there s a res 
 none 	is it changed now  or    
 find_email 	i hadn t heard back from  mari  after i   i u  u  uh  brought up the point abou  about andreas s schedule   so  um  maybe when i get back there ll be some   some mail from  her   
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i m looking forward to seeing your representation  that d be  uh  
 none 	so  i ll make a  
 none 	and w  we should get the two meetings from y  i mean  i know about the first meeting  um  but the other one that you did  the n_s_a one  which we hadn t done cuz we weren t running recognition on it  because the non native speaker   there were five non native speakers 
 none 	i d like to see that  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm  i see  mm hmm 
 none 	but  it would be useful for the   to see what we get with that one  so 
 none 	which n_s_a meeting was that 
 none 	great  o_k  it s  uh  two thousand eleven twenty one one thousand 
 none 	oh  we did   that was the last one i gave you 
 none 	yeah  three  right  so  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	great  i sent email when i finished the   that one  that was sort of son 
 none 	n_s_ a three  i think 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  that s right  that s right  that s much simpler 
 none 	i don t know what they said but i know the number 
 none 	th  that part s definitely gonna confuse somebody who looks at these later  i mean  this is   we  we re recording secret n_s_a meetings  i mean  it s  
 none 	right 
 none 	i remember the date  so 
 none 	um  not the   yeah 
 none 	uh  the   th  the  
 none 	yeah  not that n_s_a 
 none 	it s network services and applications 
 none 	they are hard to understand  they re very  uh  out there  i have no idea what they re talking about 
 none 	wait  the  
 none 	yeah  they re cryptic 
 none 	the  um   th  the other good thing about the alignments is that  um  it s not always the machine s fault if it doesn t work  so  you can actually find  um  problem   uh  proble  you can find  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s the person s fault  it s morgan s fault 
 none 	you can find  uh  problems with   with the transcripts  um  you know  and go back and fix them  but  
 none 	it s always morgan s fault 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	tha  there are some cases like where the   the wrong speaker   uh  these ca 
 none 	not a lot  but where the   the wrong person   the   the speech is addre  attached to the wrong speaker and you can tell that when you run it 
 none 	or at least you can get clues to it  so these are from the early transcriptions that people did on the mixed signals  like what you have 
 none 	interesting 
 none 	i guess it does w 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	it also raises the possibility of  um  using that kind of representation   i mean  i don t know  this d be something we d wanna check  but maybe using that representation for data entry and then displaying it on the channelized  uh  representation  cuz it   i think that the  
 none 	i mean  my   my preference in terms of  like  looking at the data is to see it in this kind of musical score format 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and also  s  you know  sue s preference as well 
 none 	yeah  if you can get it to  
 none 	and   and   but  i mean  this   if this is a better interface for making these kinds of  uh  you know  lo  clos  local changes  then that d be fine  too  i don t   i have no idea  i think this is something that would need to be checked 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  th  the other thing i had actually was  i   i didn t realize this till today  but  uh  this is  uh  jose s last day 
 none 	is my last   my last day  my   my last meeting about meetings 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh 
 none 	you re not gonna be here tomorrow 
 none 	oh  that s right  tomorrow  
 none 	yeah  because  eh  i leave  eh  the next sunday  i will come back to home   to spain 
 none 	the last meeting meeting 
 none 	it s off 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah  i d  so i   i jus 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and i   i would like to   to   to say thank you very much  eh  to all people in the group and at icsi  because i   i enjoyed  very much  uh 
 none 	oh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  it was good having you 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	and i m sorry by the result of overlapping  because  eh  i haven t good results  eh  yet but  eh 
 none 	i   i pretend to   to continuing out to spain  eh  during the   the following months  eh  because i have  eh  another ideas but  eh  i haven t enough time to   to   with six months it s not enough to   to   to research  eh  and e  i  i mean  if  eh  the topic is  eh  so difficult  uh  in my opinion  there isn t  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  maybe somebody else will come along and will be  uh  interested in working on it and could start off from where you are also  you know 
 none 	they d make use of   of what you ve done 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  eh  i   i will try to recommend  eh  at  eh  the spanish government but  eh  the following  scholarship  eh  eh  eh  will be here more time  because eh  i  in my opinion is   is better  eh  for us to   to spend more time here and to work more time i  i  in a topic  no  
 none 	yeah  it s a very short time  yeah  yeah 
 none 	but  uh  
 none 	yeah  six months is hard  i think a year is a lot better 
 none 	yeah  it is  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s difficult 
 none 	you   e  you have  eh   you are lucky  and you   you find a solution in   in   in some few tim  uh  months  eh 
 none 	o_k  but  eh  i think it s not  eh  common 
 none 	but  eh  anyway  thank you  thank you very much  eh  i   i bring the chocolate  eh  to   to tear  uh  with   with you  uh 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	oh 
 none 	ah  nice 
 none 	i   i hope if you need  eh  something  eh  from us in the future 
 none 	i   i will be at spain  to you help  uh 
 none 	great 
 none 	well 
 none 	great  thank you 
 none 	thank you  jose 
 none 	right 
 none 	and  thank you very much 
 none 	thank you 
 none 	have a good trip 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	thank you 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	keep in touch 
 none 	o_k  i guess  uh  unless somebody has something else  we ll read   read our digits and we ll get our   get our last bit of  uh  jose s   jose   jose s digit   uh  i m sorry 
 none 	digits 
 none 	uh  oops 
 none 	are we gonna do them simultaneously or    
 none 	you   eh  
 none 	ye  ye  you prefer  eh  to eat  eh  chocolate  eh  at the coffee break  eh  at the    
 none 	or you prefer now  before after    
 none 	well  we have a time  
 none 	no  we prefer to keep it for ourselves 
 none 	well  we have a s  a time   time constraint  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	during   during digits 
 none 	so keep it away from that end of the table 
 none 	yeah  yeah  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	why is it that i can read your mind 
 none 	well  we ve gotta wait until after di  after we take the mikes off 
 none 	no  no 
 none 	so are we gonna do digits simultaneously or what 
 none 	well  yeah 
 none 	you   this is our reward if we do our digi 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i   i think  eh  it s enough  eh  for more peopl  for more people after  but  eh  
 none 	simultaneous digit chocolate task 
 none 	we re gonna   we re gonna do digits at the same  
 none 	oh 
 none 	i m going to get a ticket if people don t eat some 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	that s nice  wow 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so  i have a vested interest 
 none 	um  well  
 none 	oh  thanks  jose 
 none 	to andreas  the idea is   is good  s  to eat here 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	wow  very nice 
 none 	oh 
 none 	tha  that s   that looks great  alright  so in the interest of getting to the  
 none 	oh  wow 
 none 	oh  yeah  th  it doesn t   it won t leave this room 
 none 	we could do digits while other people eat  so it s background crunching 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	is  eh  a   another acoustic event 
 none 	nice 
 none 	we don t have background chewing 
 none 	background crunch  yeah 
 none 	no  we don t have any data with background eating 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i m serious  you 
 none 	she s   she s serious  she is serious 
 none 	it s just the rest of the digits   the rest of the digits are very clean  um  without a lot of background noise  so i m just not sure  
 none 	i am serious 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	are you     oh  they re clean 
 none 	well    
 none 	yeah  
 none 	and it  
 none 	you have to write down  like  while y  what you re   what ch  chocolate you re eating cuz they might make different sounds  like n  nuts   chocolate with nuts  chocolate without nuts 
 none 	chocolate adaptation 
 none 	oh 
 none 	crunchy frogs 
 none 	um  
 none 	actually   actually kind of careful cuz i have a strong allergy to nuts  so i have to sort of figure out one without th 
 none 	that w  oh  yeah  they   they might 
 none 	it s hard to   hard to say 
 none 	maybe those  they re so  
 none 	i don t know  um  
 none 	i don t know 
 none 	this is   you know  this is a different kind of speech  looking at chocolates  deciding   you know  it s another style 
 none 	well  
 none 	take   take several 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah  i may   i may hold off  but if i was   eh  but maybe i ll get some later 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	thanks  well   well  why don t we     he   he s worried about a ticket  why don t we do a simultaneous one 
 none 	yeah  thank you 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	simultaneous one  o_k 
 none 	remember to read the transcript number  please 
 none 	and you laughed at me  too  f  the first time i said that 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oops 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i have to what 
 none 	you laughed at me  too  the first time i sa  said  
 none 	i did  and now i love it so much 
 none 	you really shouldn t  uh  te 
 none 	o_k  everyone ready 
 none 	you have to sort of  um   jose  if you haven t done this  you have to plug your ears while you re t  talking so that you don t get confused  i guess 
 none 	transcript l_ four four 
 none 	w  wait   wait a minute   wait a minute 
 none 	w  we want   we want   we want it synchronized 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hey  you ve done this before  haven t you 
 none 	yeah  oh  you ve done this one before  together 
 none 	that s  
 none 	you ve read digits together with us  haven t you   i mean  at the same time 
 none 	no 
 none 	oh  you haven t  oh  o_k 
 none 	i m not   we   we   oh  and you haven t done this either  i  the first time is traumatic  but  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh  yeah 
 none 	we 
 none 	y  yeah  bu 
 none 	oh  and the groupings are important  so yo  you re supposed to pause between the groupings 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	the grouping 
 none 	yeah  o_k  so  uh  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you mean that the   the grouping is supposed to be synchronized 
 none 	yeah  sure 
 none 	no  no 
 none 	no  no  synchronized digits 
 none 	no 
 none 	oh  wow 
 none 	no 
 none 	that d be good  we  we ll give everybody the same sheet but they say different  
 none 	it s like a   like a greek   like a greek choir  you know  like   yeah 
 none 	hey  what a good idea  we could do the same sheet for everyone  have them all read them at once 
 none 	yes 
 none 	well  different digits but same groupings 
 none 	eh  
 none 	or   or just same digits  see if anyone notices 
 none 	so they would all be   yeah 
 none 	yeah  that d be good  and then   then we can sing them next time 
 none 	there s so many possibilities  uh  o_k  why don t we go 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh  one two three   go

 none 	he had the h 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	he had the   the long form 
 none 	no 
 none 	and we re off 
 none 	is it on 
 none 	o_k  here we go

 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  
 open_agenda 	so  only a couple of agenda items  since no one sent me email for agenda items  uh  the first is  the i_b_m transcripts    i d like to uh  mention   i s  i spoke with several of you about this  but just to brainstorm a little bit about what we can do with it 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so we got back the i_b_m transcript  and the accuracy looks o_k  there are   i mean  there are areas which are clearly wrong and there are a lot of areas where they put question marks  where the acoustics weren t very good  and i think that s fine  putting it in question marks is better than doing it wrong 
 none 	the big problem was  they had the wrong number of beeps in it 
 none 	oops 
 none 	so it didn t align 
 none 	and that s exactly what i was afraid of 
 none 	and i went in  and more or less by hand  corrected it  by loading it   i wrote a script that will convert it to the multi  the channeltrans format  looked at it in   in channeltrans and found the places where it got a  unsynchronized  and then either  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	inserted ones 
 none 	and in this case only   only had to remove beeps  because that was th  always the error  is that they put in it extraneous beeps  but it s not easy to do  because the whole thing gets offset  and basically  it s assigning the wrong speaker to the text  and it all gets unaligned  so it s very difficult to do  so it took me several hours just to do that 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so this is   this is one   it s one hour of   of   of speech 
 none 	for one meeting 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and it took you a few hours to   to do it 
 none 	it took me a couple hours to write the scripts  and then it   it probably took me maybe forty five minutes  just going through it  now obviously it will be a lot faster from now on  because now i sort of understand how it works 
 none 	but  i think if we had some way   uh some tool that made it easier to insert and delete beeps it would make it a lot easier  cuz one of the problems is that it takes a very long time when you make a change to load it back up in the channel transcriber 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  that s true  i ve noticed that  yeah 
 create_single_reminder 	one of the things that  adam  said that i thought would be a good idea would be  um  if we g   used different beeps    so for example if we alternated between two beeps  a high and a low  th 
 none 	and so there may be  
 none 	which makes sense 
 none 	he said that 
 find_email 	uh  well in   in some email that  uh   we  had  
 none 	oh  on the email 
 none 	for  
 none 	oh  oh  o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i didn t just say that  no 
 none 	yeah  um   because then  
 none 	so th  so this is the o  the other approach which is  what do we do in the future  to try to make this less common  but it s still gonna happen 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  and then the other possibility was   e  that we provide them with a   a file that already has the beeps in it or something  wasn t that what you said 
 none 	so  
 none 	hunh 
 none 	sort of a text template  but i don t know how we can do that 
 none 	uh huh 
 create_single_reminder 	yeah  we don t know what their process is  so i had two ideas   the first was to  provide them a text template that had both the beeps in it and the speaker i_ds   
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you know  just  male female    english nonenglish    one two three four  
 none 	um  
 none 	can i   i   i just  
 none 	and they just filled it in 
 none 	how  how many   how many beeps are there  and how many do we  were they   d  were   were off 
 none 	it was like a hundred twenty  and they had a hundred twenty three or something like that  is that right 
 none 	alright 
 none 	well  l  i  i thought it was a lot more than that 
 none 	and is it a  
 none 	well i   i don t remember 
 none 	they were three off  basically 
 none 	yeah  and it was a hundred ish 
 none 	and this is the mixed signal 
 none 	oh 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so   so if you get one   uh  uh  excuse me  if you get one off  it   t  everything is off cuz of the alignment right 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yep 
 none 	uh  and this is all in one file that s continuous 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so why don t you make it multiple files 
 none 	how would that help 
 none 	because then if they have one off  then   then it would only screw up that file 
 none 	oh  you mean just break the one hour into a few chunks 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  it seems now  if you just ha  make one mistake then everything is off 
 none 	well the only   the only question about that that i have is  um  i think brian has to put all this stuff onto a tape 
 none 	so i don t know whether  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i m sure they would prefer it sort of one hour 
 none 	can he send them   i guess he could send them multiple tapes
 none 	oh 
 none 	uh  
 none 	yeah  just say   o_k  is    ten minutes is    i mean  maybe there s other things to do that are more clever  but this just seemed to be the sort of the obvious thing because  again  if you make one mistake  then everything after that mistake is off 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  uh  
 none 	well  the only other issue is we d have to worry about reassembling them in the proper order 
 none 	uh  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that   i mean  just naming schemes will get  
 none 	we can definitely do that  so t  so one question is  are there good places in the files where we can really do that 
 none 	well  the other thing   you can  
 none 	i mean  so   so   so someone will have to go through them and listen to them and pick a place to break them 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the other thing you can do  this is on the mixed signal  or are these the individual   the ones with the beeps that they re getting  that they made mistakes on is the mixed one 
 none 	they are played from the individual 
 none 	individual channels 
 none 	individual channels 
 none 	or they re indivi  if it s individual  um   y  c  we can   probably run a forced alignment  where you c  include the beeps as words and pretty much figure out where the errors are 
 none 	i don t think we could do it on the mixed signal  cuz it  
 none 	but on the individual channels that would probably work  if they have enough words in the transcript 
 none 	yeah  we   in fact  that s   yeah  maybe we  
 none 	so  i mean  that s pretty quick to run  it   it s  um  
 none 	i mean  we could try it 
 none 	cuz if a beep is treated as a unique word   beep   
 none 	you mean  so  actually put   put the wavefile in with beep in it 
 none 	put in   put  beep  in as a word 
 none 	and pu  and have a beep model 
 none 	we have the original wavefile with all the beeps 
 none 	yeah  yeah  well   the beep model   actually  you could train a beep model  that   that s a good idea 
 none 	it would be very good 
 none 	um  
 none 	yes  it would be  cuz it s very  very regular 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  so  um  
 none 	oh  kind of low variance  wouldn t that be  you sort of might end up with some infinities there  but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  very low 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  that might actually  
 none 	you have to   may   add some jitter to it 
 none 	can i see that 
 none 	i mean  that might actually work  because you ll  
 none 	where s the case 
 none 	i guess the trick is figuring out  you know  where it doesn t align 
 none 	but if it s a problem of extra beeps  rather than missing beeps  then   um   that s easier and it might work  oh 
 none 	it could t  it could  
 none 	there could be some missing ones  but  
 none 	so is this a seven or something  or   what is it 
 none 	it s just in this case they were not 
 none 	m_one hundred 
 none 	so i think   uh  chuck had a good explanation for it which i liked  which is these   they re listening to it and so they write something down  and let s say they miss it  they rewind 
 none 	m_one hundred  oh 
 none 	well  they hear the beep again  was that that beep  or was that a different beep  so that s why chuck was suggesting different tones  my original thought was  you could have a different tone for each speaker 
 none 	oh  yeah 
 none 	you know  there s plenty of tone space 
 none 	and that might help cue the transcriptionist 
 none 	you know  give them a little cue about where they are 
 none 	or you could   you could have ascending tones  or something 
 none 	what do you mean 
 none 	uh  
 none 	or  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	increasingly high   higher frequencies 
 none 	you could have  um  each speaker in the meeting say  beep  and record it and that will be their pro 
 none 	no  i just   thi  i don t know  if you have a hundred or something just   just sort of move them up i  mu  up a   a half tone or something for   for each one  and then  
 none 	sorry 
 none 	that s what i was saying  is that   that you could have   each speaker could have their own tone 
 none 	oh was it  oh 
 none 	see  i should listen  yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and you know  since there are no more than  you know  ten speakers or so per meeting  there s plenty of tone space 
 none 	oh 
 none 	well  
 none 	but  
 none 	uh  o_k  yeah  so the only  
 none 	that might work too  yeah  i was just thinking that actually temporally just  uh  uh  uh  an increasing tones so that they would really have a sense of whether they were going  you know  forward or backward or   yeah 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	bo eep be oop 
 none 	in the end  yeah 
 none 	well you th 
 none 	so just r  r  truly chron  chromatically up all the way through the entire meeting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  it s a thought 
 none 	interesting 
 none 	oh  oh  th  oh  i see 
 none 	it d be impossible to r  to misorder them 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but yo  i guess you d still get the mistake that you mentioned  because the person   i mean  if that s some of the errors  those would probably stay the same  regardless 
 none 	well  
 none 	yep 
 create_single_reminder 	i mean  chuck s suggestion of just two beeps is nice because then you could have them actually transcribe  h_beep  or  l_beep    high beep  or  low beep  
 none 	yeah  maybe 
 none 	and then when we get them back  if we see two l_beeps in a row  
 none 	it would be much easier 
 none 	that s probably better  yeah  s  scratch my other idea 
 none 	yeah  you have like a sanity   sanity check on them  that s a good idea  alternating 
 none 	it s pretty simple  pretty simple 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and it would   it seems like it would help them  you know  if they just finished a long passage and they heard one beep and then they hear it again  they know it s the same beep 
 none 	versus if they heard a slightly different one 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm  interesting 
 none 	yeah  that s a good  like  error checking approach  i think 
 none 	yeah  we can  yeah  like  do   do  uh  one for each ca  one for each person in the meeting  you can only hire people who have perfect pitch  and they can say  a_flat   b_  
 none 	well  well   high    low  is pretty straightforward  yeah 
 none 	great idea  yeah 
 none 	no  two is probably better than what i was suggesting  because what i was suggesting  in order to make it through a reasonable range for the whole thing  you d have to have the   the tonal differences between the two kind of small  and actually you want them large  so 
 none 	yep 
 none 	you d have to   they d have to have the acoustics of dogs t  hear into the high high ranges 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so i think  certainly  doing two beeps is   is no brainer  and then the other question is  if they can  
 none 	if they do something on a computer in a format we can handle  we could give them a text file that was a template with speaker i_d and beeps already in it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and then they could just fill that in 
 send_email 	maybe  i  should write to  brian  and tell him  what the problem was and what our proposed solutions are   
 none 	so what  
 none 	right 
 none 	see what he thinks would work best with them 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  what s going wrong on the other end  what are they doing  what  uh  
 none 	well  as i said  i think   we don t actually know  but i think chuck s hypothesis was a good one  which is  you re  r  you listen to something  you write down what you thought you heard  but you want to listen to it again  so you r  rewind 
 none 	and there are some  
 none 	and then you hear the beep again  and then you say  well  is that that beep  or is that a new beep  i don t remember   and so  you know  a couple times they got it wrong 
 none 	and there are some cases where there s  um  very little speech before you hear a beep  so you hear a little bit of speech  beep  a little bit of speech  beep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	maybe three of those in a row  and was that three beeps  was that two beeps 
 none 	um   see  they have th  brian said the setup that they have is  um   uh   i  um  
 none 	they ve got headphones and then i guess they have a computer  and they have a foot pedal which lets them quickly scan back and forth through the tape  i  i  t  i  s  makes the tape go real fast forward or fast backward 
 none 	and so they can hear something  then step on the pedal and quickly rewind and go back and hear it again  and so they re  
 none 	i think they re probably going over and over f  sections  and then they get confused about whether they ve already put that beep  or if they heard  you know  three beeps in a row  was that three or two  and  
 none 	it s a shame we can t really give a number  so it would be a number and a beep  e 
 none 	o_k  s 
 none 	it s a shame we can t do that 
 none 	well  we could 
 none 	oh  that s an interesting idea 
 none 	we could  but then that starts getting pretty long 
 none 	no  no  no  but wait  maybe   maybe what we have instead of a beep is a  uh  synthesized number 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and they put the number in when they hear it 
 none 	that ll work 
 none 	so  inst  replacing the beep with  twenty  three   
 none 	 twenty  four   
 none 	 twenty five    and then they have to transcribe what that number is each time 
 none 	wow  that d also be shorter to type 
 none 	yeah  just a  two three  two four   that would be  
 none 	well  they would have to have a mark 
 none 	interesting 
 none 	there d be some kind of mark in front of it 
 none 	well  cuz they re s  distinguishing between twenty three   that s your indicator there  and twenty three that somebody happens to say in a meeting 
 none 	oh  that s true 
 none 	well it would have t  yeah  it would have to be um  you know either obviously a s  sounding synthesized  uh  little  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but they might miss that  right 
 none 	or maybe could it be a click and the number 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	or a beep and the number 
 none 	well  it s sequential 
 none 	or a beep and the number  and then   and then you just do the   the num  th  you do it as a d  a digit 
 none 	right  you would go sequential  so unless you got pretty unlucky  what the person was saying and the number  
 none 	uh  right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	in fact  we could put it at the beginning of each utterance  we could say  beep one   
 none 	and then they ll hear the speech 
 none 	i think having a beep too is good 
 none 	so beep number  yeah the  it s just getting pretty long  you know  the utterances are very short 
 none 	or a number beep  
 none 	yep 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and so you re gonna be talking beep  number   yes   beep  number   no  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well  if   if it saves time  yeah 
 none 	yeah  and u  i think it would   i   actually  i thi  i like that  i think it would  
 none 	and when they transcribe this meeting it s gonna be really impossible 
 none 	yeah  that s funny 
 none 	w  we re saying  beep   yeah   for instance 
 none 	yeah  yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but see that would   that would definitely keep  
 none 	it s not a bad idea 
 none 	yeah  keep things from getting out of sequence  if they heard it over again they would know  it would be obvious from their transcript whether they did that one or not 
 none 	it might actually help them in terms of their place holding  yeah 
 none 	that would help get them synchronized 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and it might be helpful to them in terms of d  act 
 none 	i think it would be  because they would know their place  yeah 
 none 	and we have plenty of digits data  so 
 none 	they would know their place  darn it 
 none 	we 
 none 	know  
 none 	those transcriptionists need to know their place 
 none 	oh 
 none 	well  no no no no 
 none 	but it sounds like a k  a   a   a short conversation with brian might be   might be helpful to get a sense of what s going on 
 none 	yeah  i ll   i ll   i ll write him an  
 none 	yeah  the numbers are a good idea 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	or just  
 none 	othe  other than lengthening the transcript 
 none 	i think it would be very helpful 
 none 	just instead of the sequential number  for  perhaps just the speaker i_d or something  just say speaker one or spea  or just one  two  three  four for four speakers or something 
 none 	pppt 
 none 	i   i 
 none 	could   could be helpful 
 none 	yeah  you don t have to   you could keep them short by not s  or just go one through ten  one through ten  one through ten  or one through twenty 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and then also  if we   i mean  i don t know what their setup is  but your template idea might be a way of   of of   we could actually build the numbers into a template 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yep 
 none 	well 
 create_single_reminder 	i ll   talk to brian  and see what he  
 none 	yeah  single digit numbers  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that also appeals to me  so that you don t have to  you know  
 none 	that s a good idea 
 none 	very simple 
 none 	 one hundred twenty four 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  th  although  
 none 	 beep  one thousand three hundred forty two 
 none 	you re saying i  it s   it s about an hour meeting  and there were a hundred and twenty three  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i don t remember 
 none 	it s forty five minutes 
 none 	chuck was saying there was more than that 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	forty five minutes for that one 
 none 	more beeps than that 
 none 	i was thinking there was on the order of fifteen hundred segments  but maybe i m  
 none 	there must be  because otherwise  you re going a whole  
 none 	i think it should be more  yeah 
 none 	it s possible 
 none 	that was at least forty five minutes  right 
 none 	yeah  that s right 
 none 	was it that many  i just don t recall 
 none 	yeah  it was forty five minutes 
 none 	that s the shortest meeting we have  most of them are double that  or so
 none 	yep 
 none 	well  i was just wondering what the average length thing was 
 none 	oh  of a   of a segment that they re hearing 
 none 	it s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i don t know 
 none 	hmm  interesting 
 none 	i don t know 
 none 	uh 
 none 	easy enough to figure out  we have all that data 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so if there are in the   in the hundreds and thou  or thousands of these  
 none 	it must be in the high hundreds of them  at least 
 none 	so  right  so i 
 none 	so that s getting a little cumbersome for them to type  like  five hundred 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  with just one digit though 
 none 	i think  
 none 	well  
 none 	but yeah  if they recycle through  
 none 	yeah  if we   if we did mod ten  then  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  but my point was  you know  if   it s a big difference to me if there s a thousand or there s a hundred  if there s a thousand  then that means that this is only happening three times out of a thousand 
 none 	which means  you know  even just splitting it up into a few files would probably take   you know  nearly all the time  there would be no  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	w  if it s a hundred  then   you know  that s not the issue  but if it s a hundred  then  the average length of each one is pretty   pretty long and so having a little thing at the front of it is no big deal 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so  that s why i was curious 
 none 	yeah  you re right  it had to have been more than that  i mean  it was a forty five minute meeting  so  
 none 	right 
 none 	and it certainly was not a minute a chunk  it was a few seconds a chunk 
 none 	that s what i  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  so it d be a lot of overhead to type 
 none 	so i m just mis remembering 
 none 	i m just mis remembering 
 none 	oh  i  
 none 	so 
 none 	well  and the other thing is  maybe the numbers would help them keep their place in the transcript and speed the process  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it might make the transcript faster   w  wel  i mean i   a quick conversation with brian would be good  so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and other than that  
 none 	actually  if it is   u 
 none 	i mean  it s not a bad idea to try the alignment 
 none 	um  if there s only like three of them  then if you align  the first point at which things get messed up is sort of the location of the first problem 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and then  the second p  i mean  you could do it that way  or you could  
 none 	it s   it s   it would be able to handle any errors  so if they make  on the average  that many  and it costs them more time to do something different than what they re doing  which i don t know  but if it does  then we could try doing that as a post process  and  um  have a student or a transcriber run this alignment  or we can do it and   then you can iteratively figure out where the problems are 
 none 	right 
 none 	yep 
 none 	you know actually  what   all that we would  
 none 	you know  liz  all we would re 
 none 	it would take a little work  but not any real human   not a lot of human work 
 none 	right  i mean  that s what we want to avoid 
 none 	i mean if   in terms of the alignment  actually  all we would need is   we wouldn t even need words  we would need a general speech model and a beep model 
 none 	cuz all we re really concerned about is missing beeps or too many beeps 
 none 	well  the for  the forced alignment will run fa  otherwise it ll take forever  i mean  to really run recognition 
 none 	so if we had a  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well   l  i guess what i m thinking of is that w  that a lot of times there will be   they ll put in question marks  that represent some unknown amount of speech  so we re gonna have to have some kind of  
 none 	or    
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  then we just map it to a reject model 
 none 	in   and in fact  that s what we do now  cuz there s cases  even after jane listens  where  you know  we have   an expert can t even tell what they re talking about 
 none 	right  h 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  so that s o_k  just map that to reject and  
 none 	right 
 none 	well  what i was thinking is  map all the speech to the reject model  and then you have a beep model 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but that won t work because it s  
 none 	yeah  you re still talking a forced al 
 none 	the forced alignment might not work then  although we can try it 
 none 	um  
 none 	well  but  all we ll get  
 none 	well  with the beep models  is what s really   you d have really g  it would be really good though  so   so it s p  so it s really just doing  yeah  a keyword  like a spotting for beep with  
 none 	the beep model is   is gonna match  like  really well 
 none 	right 
 none 	right  but it ll   it ll grab the next beep  in other words  it ll be  
 none 	you ll get back another offset 
 none 	um   i mean  i was thinking of   then i   and then i realized  well  the recognizer will just go along and line up all the beeps  and then there ll be all the extra beeps at the end if there were more beeps then you wanted  
 none 	right  you   you need   but you need the text to tell it where it got it wrong  yeah 
 none 	so you need the word   you need the word to c  sort of control the relative location 
 none 	no  i m not sug  i m not suggesting that we don t have anything between the beeps 
 none 	it will tell you  
 none 	oh 
 none 	but i   what i m saying is  what s between the beeps we don t really care about 
 none 	i think you do care about it 
 none 	because you have to know which ones match which 
 none 	unless you wanna know if they re  
 none 	right  otherwise you just count up the total number of beeps 
 none 	and we can do that with wordcount 
 none 	right  we already know that   that we re three short  and so if we just did spee  uh beep and non beep all you would get is that you have three mistakes  but you wouldn t tell you which ones were wrong 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	you need some of the words in there  so that you can say  well  this segment matches this one  this segment matches this one  and this one doesn t match at all  unless we insert a beep   
 none 	i mean the only thing i m worried about with that approach is that if we need to figure out the beep alignment problem before the transcribers do the corrections here  then we re in trouble  in other words  if the transcripts aren t sort of good enough that the aligner constraints are good enough to sort of show you where the errors are  then it wouldn t work  but it might work  it might work to do this if their transcripts are pretty close on the words that usually get recognized correctly  which are the  you know  function words  the common words 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well  actually  you know  there s an even easier way  we don t really need a beep model 
 none 	um  just extract the segments and do a forced alignment  and if the score is good  then you say it matches  
 none 	right  you can also  
 none 	in fact that s what we do  
 none 	right  the individual segments between the beeps  
 none 	um  if beeps were like the segments that we get from um  the transcription tool already  that that s what we have done  and it works very well  you can see these segments align and these don t 
 none 	um  then you just have to go back in and figure out where the endpoints of those segments are  cuz some of them will be wrong 
 none 	because the bi  the beeps were missing  by definition 
 none 	right 
 none 	so do you get a score for each alignment  is that what you get 
 none 	so it might actually work 
 none 	um  you ca  you get  um  
 none 	definitely when they don t align at all  it   it   it fails 
 none 	i mean  that   that s how we found a lot of problems before  with  um  words being on the wrong place or something 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so a failed alignment is a very good indicator that   that   the words don t match up 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i m just wondering when   wha  what it means to fail 
 none 	um  
 none 	is it the   the likelihood scores below some threshold  
 none 	yeah  is  uh   it   right 
 none 	it can t match up the  
 none 	that s why you actually need the text  in order to force you to try to match something that gives you a model to match against 
 none 	so   it s just an idea  if   if it turns out that  
 none 	i mean  i also like this idea of high and low beeps  or  
 none 	but it   if  
 none 	suppose we get one or two errors  still  per   you know  per transcript  then we z  we might wanna try some approach like that 
 none 	well  the numbered ones would make it a lot easier  cuz you could then really localize where the error is 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	where it is 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	if   so  if that doesn t add time for them  that d be great  you know  like  
 none 	yep 
 none 	i think it would save them time  i think it would help them keep the track   track of it 
 none 	we have to ask them 
 none 	uh   uh  again  especially if there s hundred   many hundreds or thousands i still think it would   it would cut the incidence of this a lot if it was possible to break it into a couple files 
 none 	interesting  yeah 
 none 	yeah  cuz it  you know  it s r  r 
 none 	i guess also even for the transcribers  it s quicker to load a smaller file   into the   you know  t  for the checking problem 
 none 	yeah  i mean  we could certainly break the meetings  
 none 	into twenty minutes chunks or something  or  
 none 	we could certainly break the meetings into pi  pieces 
 none 	so  just  
 none 	i mean  you ve already broken them into chunks  so if you have   if you have a th  if you have a thousand chunks then make ten things of a hundred  or   or you know 
 none 	just  
 none 	just accumulate it till you get twenty minutes worth 
 none 	there s one file 
 none 	that s true  yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and then it will be  you know  this   eve  every now and then there ll be a   a beep missing 
 none 	so  someone s gonna talk to brian 
 none 	yeah  i ll  
 none 	i think that was chuck 
 none 	i ll talk to him 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yep 
 none 	i also looked thr  over the text and i was impressed by the accuracy  it looks really good 
 none 	yeah  it does look good  i mean  i found several errors  but they were not significant 
 none 	they were all things that i could easily listen to and sometimes convince myself they said one thing and sometimes the other  so 
 none 	yeah  it s there  mm hmm 
 none 	i haven t looked at these  um   cuz i was gone last week  but   but don had told me that there s a difference in some of the conventions 
 none 	oh  yes  but this is not important  it s systematic  yeah 
 none 	so   but those are all easy things  right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and   and brian actually forwarded me in advance  he   he wor  he very nicely worked out a set of conventions which is intermediate between ours and the ones that they re used to  which is   which is really a good   a good way to do it 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so we can just map   map them to  
 none 	no problem 
 none 	great 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um  
 none 	we still haven t really sat down and talked about file reorganization  and directory reorganization  so we still have to do that 
 none 	but i don t think we need to do that in this meeting 
 none 	but  uh  
 none 	it is something that needs to get done  and i wanna also coordinate it with dave so that we do a level zero backup right after 
 none 	so we don t waste a lot of tapes 
 none 	but  uh  
 none 	so   let s   let s try to do that sometime  o_k  ch  o_k 
 none 	yeah  we can do it this week 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  
 none 	we also still have to make a decision about mike issues  what we wanna do with that 
 none 	i thought we were going to get two more of the ones  
 none 	and just swap them in and out 
 none 	yeah  we could certainly do that 
 none 	so why not 
 none 	so   uh  morgan  just to   uh  since you weren t at the meeting last week  uh  apparently a bunch of the e_d_u fe  folks really hate this style mike 
 none 	um  i wouldn t   well  it   they didn t say  hate  but they   they c  they come on time to their meetings in order to not be left the last person who has to sit by those mikes 
 none 	can i   i c  i  
 none 	i mean  that s   that s   that s a fairly strong indication of dislike 
 none 	i actually really like them though 
 none 	um  
 none 	which one is these  the uh  
 none 	there were a few people   you  and like  three or four people who really like them 
 none 	the crown 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	yeah  i do 
 none 	and e  and th  all the others really don t 
 none 	so what i was thinking is  we could get a few more of the sony ones and just unplug them and plug them in  and the only thing is that when you fill out the digit forms  you have to be sure to indicate which mike was actually used 
 none 	so  i mean  that s easy to do  um   it   it   moves us away from this uniform  all the mikes are the same  which some people had said was a benefit 
 none 	but  
 none 	the other thing  too  is th  y  you said that the acoustic pra  q  quality of the one that you re wearing  the fancy one  is actually somewhat better than
 none 	it is 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so i  i don t know if it s a noticeable difference  but it is  
 none 	i mean  i p  i personally really prefer that model  so i think you know we ve got this problem of people having different   different preferences 
 none 	you know  there are so many things about this that are non uniform that i think having   having some modicum of uniformity is a good thing  but you re just not going to   i mean we ve   uh  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	for instance  jus  just the fact that people sit in different positions  different times  the   exactly where they put it with respect to their mouth is different each time 
 none 	yep 
 none 	uh  
 none 	i   i just don t   i mean  i think we   we re   we re getting rid of major differences like we re not using the lapel anymore  an  and so forth  but the other stuff is just gonna   some variability we re gonna have to accept 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	it s   i   i understand  that s fine with me  i   i g  would say that um  i find this model easier to adjust  that s one of the reasons i don t like these  cuz i keep m  you know  bending it  and then it s n  and i never really know  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	yeah  see i   i happen to like the old one better 
 none 	you do  o_k 
 none 	but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what about just a different headband thing 
 none 	and some people do  but  
 none 	or even if we could attach two headband   like  i don t mind those  but it   they bounce around 
 none 	i mean   th 
 none 	we abs  th 
 none 	we have lots o  of choices of microphones  so  
 none 	i mean  can we keep the microphones  and just somehow attach a more comfortable thing over your head 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s my problem with this one  the   the ear thing comes out to here  it doesn t even fit over my ear 
 none 	right 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and for some of the others  it s   their ears were shaped in a way that didn t hold the  
 none 	right 
 none 	huh 
 none 	i mean  so we can go microphone shopping  and get   get more microphones  it s just   w 
 none 	then they have to be rewired though  don t they 
 none 	i m just not sure what we should do 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you know  i mean  here s another argument against worrying too much about uniformity  we have something like forty five hours of data collected 
 none 	specially 
 none 	and  uh  we re also gonna be integrating in this corpus stuff that s   that s being done at u_w  uh  with entirely different microphones  so i   i think  you know  getting away from the lapel  having close mounted mikes  having people adjust them as they re most   as   as   as comfortable as they can  
 none 	yep 
 none 	well  i  
 none 	i think that s sort of the big deal 
 none 	i agree with that  and so my feeling is  we should get mikes that people like 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and so i  my feeling is  going out and buying a few more mikes is fine 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  that s right 
 none 	so should i just go do that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	what about these  
 none 	and then also  should we go ahead and get another wireless system 
 none 	you know  for whatever it s gonna be  uh  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh  another wireless system 
 none 	you mean  another transmitter  or   or  
 none 	uh  no  actually  get   we need another box  because each   each box in the back room can only take six 
 none 	oh  to get r  to get rid of the wired things  yes  absolutely 
 none 	so we could 
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  because   cuz we ve had   with the exception of forgetting to change the batteries from time to time  uh  we ve really had no tr  no trouble with this at all  right  and   and the wired stuff is just gonna continue to degrade as  you know  and nobody will remember how to   yeah  nobody will remember how to repair a jimbox or a jimlet or a   you know  it s  
 none 	so i ll just go d  i ll do that 
 none 	yep 
 none 	another one just bit the dust 
 none 	really 
 none 	i think there s a problem with this one 
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k  then i will just go do that  and send the bill to   uh  what s her name 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	whoever will pay  yeah 
 none 	whoever will pay  you 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	i have a quick question about microphones  um  
 none 	i got   this crazy idea that  um  i  in the future  people will just walk around with the microphones that they use for their cell phones 
 none 	you know  these little boom ones  like  and really go to meetings with close talking mikes  if they re their own personal microphone 
 none 	and so i m wondering if we can get a couple of tho  i don t know how good quality they are  but it would be really interesting to see if they re good enough 
 none 	do you mean the kind that hang from the ear  sort of thing  or the  
 none 	the k  kind that guys that like to look like they re really cool at airports wear 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  but i don t know that one  so what s that mean 
 none 	this   it s   it s a cell phone jack 
 none 	oh  yeah  you do 
 none 	you can t miss it 
 none 	you cannot miss it  they re the guys going around   they re probably talking to nobody  but
 none 	is this   just this little  
 none 	oh they   they have little headsets  or what do they  
 none 	yep 
 none 	th  d 
 none 	yes  they wear the heads 
 none 	yep 
 none 	e  well  there you go  yes  that s   that   it looks sort of like that 
 none 	oh you ve   you ve got one 
 none 	except that one s even bigger than most of the ones i ve seen  most of the ones are just a little boom 
 none 	so where   where does   how do you wear that  what does that  
 none 	you   you put it over the corner of your ear 
 none 	yeah  over the corner of the ear  
 none 	i can t   i m having competing microphone   headphone problems here 
 none 	there s another kind which s  goes in your ear and it hangs down  there s a little b  bulb that hangs   has the mike on it 
 none 	huh 
 none 	yep  it just ha  just hangs down there  yeah 
 none 	yeah  that i ve seen  yeah 
 none 	o_k  so whatever people sort of wear to use l  yeah  something like tha  with their cell phones  it d be really great  i think  if we can argue t  that   people like that 
 none 	this one 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s an interesting idea 
 none 	the acoustics   the acoustics on this are really s  m  better than when i talk into it directly 
 none 	yeah  the   the biggest issue is the stupid cable that sony  
 none 	but   what  
 none 	are they 
 none 	why would it be cool 
 none 	the connector that sony has  that  uh  
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	so it s   they re not compatible 
 none 	it s non standard  and so you can t just plug something in  you need to get it wired 
 none 	oh  i m sorry  you re talking about that as a possible thing to plug into the sonys  no 
 none 	well  um  just as an example for  you know  the future  of the fact that maybe people will wear those microphones  or some people might  to meetings  you know 
 none 	right 
 none 	how standard are these 
 none 	works with this  i don t know 
 none 	well  some people will  yeah 
 none 	not a   i m not saying there s not a far field microphone  uh  application  but  
 none 	if we have a choi  i ve always wondered how well they would work 
 none 	it is an interesting idea  if we could build an adaptor that went from   cuz i think mine looks like this too  if we had this style plug that went to that  then we d just have adaptors and people would plug them in 
 none 	right 
 none 	you could use   they could use their own 
 none 	oh  right  so they could use the  
 none 	i wonder if you could do an adaptor  i don t know if you can or not 
 none 	anyway  it s just an idea  um  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	an adaptor might be a better idea than do  redoing the wiring all the time 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	well  i mean  another s 
 none 	an  another side to that is that  um  in principle  uh  if it all comes together  supposedly we re gonna get two um  i_ram boards 
 none 	right 
 none 	uh  little later on in the year 
 none 	and so  we re gonna wanna be thinking in terms of some wireless connection to it 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  so we have  you know  some kind of little something  and  uh  we have a wireless connection  this board  that s doing the computation for the f  the  uh   the recognition 
 none 	and so  you know  we wanna be able to show off to somebody  you know  we have a base station somewhere  and you re wandering around  uh  hands free  and  
 none 	yep 
 none 	i don t understand  so   so there s a mike that plugs in  
 none 	you re saying there s a mike that plugs in to the i_ram board  or  
 none 	no  no  what i m saying is that we re gonna have to put together some kind of a little superstructure  d  some sort of demo box that it   that doesn t do a whole lot  but it somehow connects to   uh  remotely to this i_ram board which will be doing the real computation 
 none 	demo 
 none 	oh  i see 
 none 	in other words  we re   we re not gonna attempt to build  uh  it   do the real work of building a portable device that s little  that is doing all the computation we wanna do for the recognition and the far field mike  uh  compensation and all that stuff  so we re gonna do all that on this powerful board  and  uh  have some wireless connection to it  and then the question is what is   what does it look like  does it look like something that you   you hold like this  or do we make a big deal out of it that you hold it arm   at arm s length th  so that you can see some display  or  uh  do we have one of these   you know  i don t know 
 none 	so  it th  these are all possibilities 
 none 	yep 
 none 	i mean  what i was envisioning was a p_d_a with a cellular link in it 
 none 	you know  with one of the r  short range wireless 
 none 	and let th 
 none 	just do   capture the audio on the p_d_a and send the audio over the wireless net 
 none 	yeah  so  is  is bluetooth the sort of thing that d be  uh  
 none 	but 
 none 	uh  bluetooth is shorter range  but you could use bluetooth 
 none 	wh  whatever the network guys already have hooked up for this floor  i don t remember what it s called 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	o_k  then uh  another issue on file reorganization is  uh  making data available to people outside icsi 
 none 	so  specifically  the u_ w folks have been wanting to get access to it  so i think the right thing to do for that  is figure out how to do c_v_s without uh  compromising security  some pass  s_s_h tunneled
 none 	c_v_s  and then give them access 
 none 	well  i  i was  
 none 	i was reading through some of the c_v_s documentation and you can just substitute c_v_s for your r_s_ h command 
 none 	yes  except that the command has to not take a password 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	because it  it s non interactive  and so the only way to do that is with  uh  
 none 	s_hosts   which is insecure 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so we still have to sort of look at it a little bit  i mean  i m sure it s been solved  and i just haven t found the solution yet 
 none 	but i am sure that people have done it because it s gonna be a problem a lot of people have 
 none 	but  um  
 none 	who   well  we re s  talking about a fairly limited group  are   are   is it a small enough group that they would   could just have accounts  does that solve anything 
 none 	uh  n  n  not really  because then we have the coordination issue 
 none 	i mean  so one thing they could do   i mean  i guess that s true  they could simply log in to icsi and do everything locally 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well they re gonna have to have accounts  
 none 	if they use s_s_h they have to have an account anyways 
 none 	yeah  except they could share one 
 none 	well  but that s not  
 none 	the  uh   the s_s_h accounts  and the user accounts don t have to be similar 
 none 	so 
 none 	i mean  there are lots of ways of doing it  but w  but if we can t figure out a remote way of doing it  just letting them log in to icsi might be o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so the intention was to put everything except the audio files themselves under revision control 
 none 	and the audio files  it s not worth doing cuz they re too big  you re never gonna be copying them around and making working copies of them 
 none 	right 
 add_agenda_item 	and then the other issue jane and i spoke of briefly is just  general permission issues   
 none 	that right now  lots of people create the files and then we have group  meeting recorder  
 none 	but that means anyone in the meeting recorder group can overwrite the files 
 none 	and so that s a pretty coarse level of granularity  so we might wanna think about doing a meeting recorder user   owner for those files  and then doing group slightly differently  but  
 none 	can you just do  like  s_u_x or something to modify  
 none 	i think what we have now  
 none 	i mean  if you just have one user that  
 none 	another option is to m  make a non  make it owned by a not real user  and then root will be able to do it 
 none 	but root is pretty tightly controlled here 
 none 	i had another thought 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so th  i don t think that s a good solution 
 none 	would   w  would it be possi  there are scripts that uh  run  and   and when it s finished compressing  would it be possible for the script to change the permissions on the file to be more strict 
 none 	have them  
 none 	yes  but if you do that  then someone who isn t the owner can t unchange it 
 none 	but after the meeting s done  would they want to 
 none 	yeah  as i said  it s just a question of  uh  do you wanna have to track down root if you have to make any change 
 none 	but it doesn t have to be root  it could be some other user that we all can s_u_x to 
 none 	that s true 
 none 	you have security issues with that 
 none 	so 
 none 	yeah  that s true 
 none 	i mean  
 none 	that s what we do with doctor speech though  right 
 none 	no  with doctor speech  it s just a group 
 none 	so   there re lots of different owners of i  i  of the files  but the group is always doctor speech 
 none 	or real  usually 
 none 	but there is a user doctor speech 
 none 	right 
 none 	i mean  i   i s_u_x to doctor speech w  when i need to make a   a directory on  uh  one of the  
 none 	nnn 
 none 	oh  do you 
 none 	oh  so tha  that s what i meant  it   just some user like  meeting root  or something 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	i don t know 
 none 	i mean  i m not too worried  because the group s pretty small 
 none 	but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	also it seems like once it s been stored that night  it s   it s possible to recover from backups  so that the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it was recorded 
 none 	well  and just   you  then  also just have the general problem of permission on the other files  that  do you want people checking out a transcript file when they find an error  and correcting it  or do they wa  do you want it to go through you 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and i d prefer it to go through me 
 none 	o_k  but that means that you re gonna have to be available for people  all the time  who say  there s an error here   rather than just   them just going in and correcting it 
 none 	well i p  at this point   yeah 
 none 	well  with c_v_s  though  you don t actually have to do it that way 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  but  
 none 	you have a choice  either you let people do it themselves  or you don t 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what i m saying is that it can be the case that people can do it themselves and it can be reviewed 
 none 	w  w 
 none 	well 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	i mean  it s not like it s one or the other  we can do both 
 none 	yeah  you can  
 none 	right  so you could get email 
 none 	send email to jane that someone has done a revision 
 none 	right 
 none 	i   i wanna also say that  you know  this is a   uh  uh  my   my view on this is that once it s in a final version and i m working toward all these being final versions  then it can go into this next ro  this next realm  but it   it s sort of counter productive to have changes made which i would be making if i d just gotten that far in the file  you know  it s   it s  um 
 none 	well  so  you don t have to release it to the world until you re ready to 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s right 
 none 	so the question is s  w 
 none 	and then after that  then this would probably work 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so you would keep it in a separate file structure until you were ready to put it in the repository 
 none 	good  good 
 none 	i mean  
 none 	or just keep the lock on it 
 none 	is c_v_s  like   yeah  just keep the lock on 
 none 	i mean  just check it out   check it out and don t let anyone check it out  
 none 	until you re   yep 
 none 	no  it does not   the c_v_s doesn t work that way 
 none 	oh  it  
 none 	oh  it doesn t  oh  o_k 
 none 	there s no   there s no lock when you check something out  not like r_c_s 
 none 	in other words  everybody can check out anything 
 none 	oh 
 none 	the c_ stands for  concurrent  
 none 	so why not use r_c_s at that point  just at that stage 
 none 	cuz it s not remote 
 none 	it s not remote 
 none 	the nice thing about c_v_s is   is  you can be on a different machine 
 none 	but at that point   we only want  probably  jane to be in control anyway  and she   i mean  it s just an i 
 none 	no  because u_w wants to have access to these files  that s the whole point 
 none 	but not to modify them  right  just to read them 
 none 	well  if they k  en  if they record a meeting  and they create a  key  file  and they find an error in their  key  file  they shouldn t have to tell us about that so that they can create   correct an error in one of their files 
 none 	well  the   key   file is   ke    key   file s different 
 none 	so that s why i wanna do it  
 none 	i don t know  uh   i mean  
 none 	 key  fi 
 none 	different than what 
 none 	well   key  file has the extra attributes that if you notice that there are lots of spikes on channel so and so  it s useful as a repository for putting that there 
 none 	and also if you notice that there was an extra speaker  and didn t get mentioned in the  key  file  but they were only there for a second  but it s t  useful to mention that they were there 
 none 	so i th  i think that the  key  file is usefu  for notations related to the meeting  but it s different from the transcript 
 none 	well  
 none 	b 
 none 	but  i mean  the meetings are gonna be the same way  so u_w records a meeting  we transcribe it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	a few months later they listen to it and they say  ope  they got that acronym wrong  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	why   why sh 
 none 	then they should send that through   well  
 none 	it s sort of not really a question about permissions  but more of procedure  either those all go through jane  or through someone  or they all don t  but it s sort of  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and if they all do  then there isn t a problem  right  cuz once they give us the data  it s ours  and if they wanna make changes   i mean  ours to sort of transcribe and annotate 
 none 	and if they wanna make changes  they can do that 
 none 	the   the p  the point here is that it would be nice t  for there to be one repository 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah
 none 	and if we don t let them modify their own data  they re not gonna store their data in our repository 
 none 	or if we make it inconvenient for them to change their data 
 none 	so then if they do have acc 
 none 	i   i m just looking at it the other way around 
 none 	o_k  so what if they have  
 none 	what if they have accounts here  and they use r_c_s  at that point  where you can l  really lock a file 
 none 	so   so let s say we k 
 none 	i mean  i m worried  if you can t lock a file  this   this to me sounds very scary 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	um  
 none 	and if they have accounts here and they re modifying it   if they re ac  if they re so closely linked that they re actually modifying transcripts and  key  files  then they could do it by  you know  secure shelling into icsi  under r_c_s  at that point 
 none 	ye  well  i don t see a real difference between r_c_s and any other system 
 none 	i mean  it s just mechanisms  the nice thing about c_v_s is that you can have multiple people modifying and if the changes don t overlap each other  they can just do it 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	that s interesting 
 none 	so the problem with r_c_s is that if two people want to modify a file at the same time they can t  because the granularity of locking is at the file level 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what  what does c_v_s do if they   if they do overlap 
 none 	uh  there re lots of different policies for dealing with it  so  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but typically a person has to  uh  mediate you know  which changes actually get   go through 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah  to decide which one is   yeah 
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh  i 
 none 	so  maybe there is a way in c_v_s to effectively lock something if you don t want people to make any changes 
 none 	at the repository level  there certainly is  you can mark a file as   as  you can t check this out  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	oh  so  
 none 	c_v_s is pretty good 
 none 	so then you could use c_v_s and  you know  just f  have remote access  but then it s up to whoever is  sort of  responsible for that level of transcription to decide how and when to put these locks  or  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yep 
 none 	well  it s   it s just like source code  right 
 none 	so that  when you re developing it and it s really rough  you don t put it in the repository 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you wait to the point when you re ready to release it  and then you put it in the repository and if other people wanna  
 none 	yeah  so the w 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	in 
 none 	the   maybe the model   it s a little bit different in c_v_s  when you check something out  you actually create your own directory with copies of everything in it  and that s what you work on 
 none 	copy 
 none 	so  until you re ready to check it in  nobody sees anything you ve done  and then when you check it in  it puts  sort of  you know   every change that you ve done is   goes into the central  
 none 	right 
 none 	so if that s at an 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i guess it depends on jane s   uh  you know  if that s   if that model works for the transcripts  then that s fine  but if that pr  um  allows someone to come in and modify while you re modifying  and they turn out to be changes that  you know  would have been better to wait until your version came out  then that s really up to you  not up to the software  so 
 none 	well 
 none 	i also think  um  that the type of change ch  ch  varies an  i think it s a very good point  because what if the   uh  what if one set of changes one person was making was with reference to some typographical convention 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and the other person n  unkn  n  quite unknowingly  was changing it the other way around 
 none 	then you could end up with a real mess  in terms of  like  consistency of conventions across a file  there is an argument to be made for having a single editor editing at that level 
 none 	well yeah  there would   there would have to be somebody to enforce the consistency  yeah 
 none 	but i like b  i like what liz is saying about  
 none 	that s right  and i also like   i l  also like liz s uh  k  um  phraseology of  at this level of    i don t remember how you put it  but this    at this level of transcription  or whatever  i mean it s like there are different layers of whatever and different types of conventions  and if it were an acronym  then i would   i think that it would make sense f  for them to have input into that level of things  but i wouldn t want them to be changing  
 none 	i m just  
 none 	imagine that we reverse this and they were keeping the repository and we were d  collecting meetings and sending them to them 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	if i found an error  and i sent them email and said  here s this error   and i didn t get a response for a couple weeks 
 none 	i would stop sending them the   my data and i would start collecting it here and we would end up with two corpora 
 none 	well  yeah 
 none 	and i don t want that to happen  so we have to make it convenient for them to make changes that they wanna make 
 none 	i agree 
 none 	well  
 none 	well  i see now  we re k  back into the same situation as when we were  uh  talking about a  allowing people to edit the transcripts before they become public 
 none 	so there s a question of how easy or how hard to modify  and how that impacts the amount of changing that s done 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and i   i think that it s  um 
 none 	i   i have received some suggestions for change  which i ve made 
 none 	and um  i think with an acronym  that s a clear case where it would be an easy change to incorporate 
 none 	but it would worry me to have people  um  having free reign to change these things  because of the need to have consistent conventions  and people who are only just visiting the data might not have a sense of the larger system 
 none 	yeah  that s what i would be worried about too 
 none 	well  i think   yeah  i think there are probably ways that you can say that  you know  only certain users are allowed to change things 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh  so we can probably restrict it to be  
 none 	you know  f  casual users who are just browsing can just r  get it read only  can t check in to the archive 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	whereas we could say  other people   you know   these people are allowed to actually submit changes  
 none 	right 
 none 	i mean 
 none 	i   i think one thing that s probably everybody would agree on is that there will never be a point where you know  we can say that for sure there s no problems with any of the transcripts  i mean there s  uh   f  you know  something s going to get overlooked at some point  or somebody s gonna wanna make a change somehow  so we need to have some mechanism for  um  handling changes in the future 
 none 	i agr  i agree but i have to also add one other thing which i  before i forget it  which is
 none 	adam s point about when you were reviewing the i_b_m transcripts  u  this was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting 
 none 	you said that there were some places where it wasn t what y  was written already  but you could see how they might have thought that s what it said 
 none 	so there   it s not just a right and wrong thing  sometimes there tru  there are absolutely stretches where there is no   no   k  if you were at the meeting and you could ask the person  maybe  m  you know  they could   they could ve told you  but five minutes later they might not have been able to tell you  even if they were listening to it 
 none 	yeah  exactly 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  sometimes it isn t right and wrong  sometimes it s multiple interpretations  and  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	good point  yeah 
 none 	now   but of course  this does raise the possibility of allowing  um  an extra annotation for  you know  alternative interpretations of a stretch 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but i just wanted to say it isn t simply right or wrong 
 none 	yeah  that s a good point 
 none 	or overlooked or not overlooked 
 none 	sometimes they re truly ambiguous  and um  uh  um  nice to have a notation for that  but  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	gotta go 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  i like that idea because even a casual user can always send email to whoever s in charge  and say  you know   we d like these changes  and  you know  hopefully we ll give them a response  and if they really do it a lot  and they say
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well  
 none 	i just   i don t s 
 none 	i don t see that this is e 
 none 	yep 
 none 	 we re a casual user but we want a chance to change the transcripts   then we can face that if it happens  but
 none 	can you write  unread  on that 
 none 	yeah  thank you 
 none 	i don t really see the people at u_w that i know of right now making huge amoun  investing huge amounts of time in changing transcripts  but i could be wrong 
 none 	probably not transcripts  but it would be nice to have one mechanism for all the files 
 none 	and they re certainly gonna wanna change tools 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and so   you know  it s the same as source code  you   you release source code at some point 
 none 	and  either you have to do everything or you share responsibility 
 none 	yeah i mean a lot of the open source pro  projects face this same problem 
 none 	right 
 none 	you know  p  anybody can check out the code  but not everybody can check it in  yeah 
 none 	right  and there s some happy medium and we don t know what that is yet until we get feedback from people  but what if it s o_k to just handle it with sort of a person in charge of the philosophy behind the changes  and some people with permissions  maybe by request  to make changes  that we don t just give people permissions if they re not gonna make changes  because i ve overwritten a   a file by mistake  not wanting to have done that cuz i didn t think i had permission  when i did 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  and then just seeing if that is enough to   to handle the transcript changes 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i m just worried about letting everybody go in and make changes  cuz it s real easy when you re trying to  i don t know  run alignments and there s a word you wanna fix  to go in and do that and then mess up other things  if you don t know  you know  the overall philosophy behind the   the conventions 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	and als  it also  mm hmm 
 none 	then   there is also the possibility   remember  in c_v_s  when we talk about making changes  there s sort of two types that can be made  to your local  or to the global 
 none 	you can back everything out 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and so people can make changes to their local and if they screw those up  that s  you know  in their   that s only on them  it s w  it s the checking in part that r  we really care about  and that we can control with  you know  who can check things in and stuff  so we can   i think we can do this 
 none 	right 
 none 	exactly 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	or just  yeah  start by make it a really tight control and then as people really need the control you can ascertain whether or not to  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  they can still check it out  
 none 	yeah  cuz they can still check out full copies and make whatever changes they want to their local copies 
 none 	right 
 none 	and it won t affect the   the g  the global  official  ones at all 
 none 	right 
 none 	right  but what i want to avoid is ending up with two corpora 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yes 
 none 	and so if you make it too hard for them to check back in  they ll check it out once  they ll make all the changes  they ll never tell us about the changes  and we ll get two different corpora 
 none 	definitely 
 none 	yep 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	i think we re already gonna   i mean there s already some chance that different annotations  different places  you know  
 none 	but you can control that by knowing you re making two corpora or knowing that you re adding um  annotations on one version and you don t have the latest corrections maybe at that point  and then you finish the project and you realize that there were corrections made on your originals and then you have to merge them 
 none 	and the b  the thing that makes it ea  o_k to do that  is knowing where the synch time boundaries are 
 none 	cuz you can automatically pretty much merge things if you ve only got twenty words or so in an utterance  it s when you get the whole meeting and the synch times ch  have changed  or you can t correspond to a previous version with synch times  that you get in trouble 
 none 	so 
 none 	was there anything else on your list 
 none 	nope 
 none 	shall we do some digits 
 none 	uh  transcript l_ one one six 
 none 	now  wait  are   are we doing them simultaneously or one at a time  alright 
 none 	i wasn t planning on doing it simultaneously 
 none 	lee   you liked that l  huh 
 none 	transcript l_ one one six  eight two six  four four five  one nine nine one three one one  eight seven three six  seven one one seven eight  two eight three  eight zero  three eight two  nine two  seven five eight  four three  zero nine nine  seven zero nine four  four eight four  four seven four seven six  four one  eight eight  nine nine  eight seven three two  four six  four three  one nine  two eight four seven six two  four o_ four five  nine six five one 
 none 	transcript l_ one one seven  seven five eight  five one three  o_ seven one four two six nine four  five six two three  seven o_ four four seven  five one three  seven four  eight o_ one  five six six two seven  five  three seven six eight o_ six  nine seven six  one four two one three nine  eight five  two three one o_ eight eight four four  four  two nine five four six one  one o_ three  two two four 
 none 	transcript l_ dash one two seven  two eight two  two seven six  eight six four eight eight three  two zero six  two six two eight seven  five six  seven six  one seven  zero zero seven eight three zero  seven five two seven  five three eight three five five  seven three  zero eight  five nine  five seven one  four eight two  eight nine  six six seven  zero two nine three six  nine two one five  zero five eight zero nine seven six  six o_ three  nine seven six 
 none 	transcript l_ one two nine  zero nine  zero zero  five three  nine two  five five six  zero three seven  seven zero  nine eight eight  nine zero seven five  nine six nine  one one eight two six eight seven  two five  one one four four
 none 	o_ four four  five five two  seven five o_ five five  seven five three  o_ o_  six seven nine one seven eight four  three  two seven eight six three seven five  one  two eight four 
 none 	transcript l_ one two eight  eight  four three two  three six  one o_ seven  six zero four six  six nine  six five o_ nine six two  eight seven  eight one  seven seven  o_ two nine  seven nine two  one zero  zero five five  one three zero  four seven  nine  six one five two zero seven two  six zero  six zero  six seven  four two three  five two four  zero six  six o_ two  eight three eight two  two seven  one nine nine six 
 none 	oop  ouch 
 none 	ooo 
 none 	st 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so we re on 
 none 	that s better 
 open_agenda 	and  somewhere is my agenda  
 add_agenda_item 	i think the most important thing is morgan wanted to talk about  uh   the arpa demo   
 none 	well  so  here s the thing 
 none 	um  why don t we s  again start off with   with  uh   n 
 none 	yeah  i ll get it 
 none 	i ll get the door 
 none 	um 
 none 	i think we want to start off with the agenda 
 none 	and then  given that  uh  liz and andreas are gonna be ten  fifteen minutes late  we can try to figure out what we can do most effectively without them here  so  
 none 	o_k  so  uh  
 add_agenda_item 	so   so  one thing is  yeah  talk about  demo   
 add_agenda_item 	uh   i_b_m transcription status   
 none 	i_b_m transcription  
 none 	uh  what else 
 add_agenda_item 	smartkom   
 none 	smartkom  
 none 	smartkom  
 search 	what s  smartkom   
 add_agenda_item 	uh  we wanna talk about  if w  if we wanna add the data to the mar  meeting recorder corpus   
 none 	the data 
 none 	the data which we are collecting here 
 none 	what   what   what are we collecting here 
 none 	data 
 add_agenda_item 	so why don t we have that on the agenda and we ll   we ll get to it and talk about  it   
 none 	the smartkom data  
 none 	yeah  right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  right 
 none 	uh 
 add_agenda_item 	uh   reorganization status   
 none 	reorganization status  
 none 	oh 
 add_agenda_item 	files and directories   
 none 	files and directories  
 none 	yep 
 none 	uh huh 
 add_agenda_item 	absinthe  which is the multiprocessor unix   linux   
 add_agenda_item 	i think it was andreas wanted to talk about  segmentation and recognition   
 add_agenda_item 	and  update on s_r_i recognition experiments   
 none 	um  
 add_agenda_item 	and then if ti  if there s time i wanted to talk about  digits   but it looked like we were pretty full  so i can wait till next week  
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well  let s see 
 none 	i think the a  certainly the segmentation and recognition we wanna maybe focus on when an  andreas is here since that was particularly his thing 
 none 	and also the smartkom thing should b 
 none 	smartkom also 
 none 	andreas 
 none 	absinthe  i think also he has sort of been involved in a lot of those things  yeah 
 none 	at least  yeah   he ll t  he ll probably be interested 
 none 	but 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um
 none 	so  i mean  i think they ll be inter  i ll be interested in all this  but   but  uh  probably  if we had to pick something that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they re coming here  or i guess it would be  you think  reorganization status  or    
 none 	yeah  i mean  i think 
 none 	chuck was the one who added out the agenda item  i don t really have anything to say other than that we still haven t done it 
 none 	so 
 none 	well  i mean  i uh   just basically that   maybe i said   maybe we said this before   just that we met and we talked about it and we sort of have a plan for getting things organized and  
 none 	and i   and i think a crucial part of that is the idea of   of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back up so that there won t be huge number of   of added  uh  
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	that   that was basically it  not   not much   
 none 	although dave basically said that if we wanna do it  just tell him and he ll do a d  level zero then 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	oh  excellent 
 none 	so 
 none 	oh  so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready  and  
 none 	oh  good 
 none 	yep 
 none 	so  i think we do need to talk a little bit about  
 none 	well  we don t need to do it during this meeting  we have a little more to discuss 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  uh  we re   we re basically ready to do it 
 none 	and  uh  i have some web pages on ts  more of the background 
 none 	so  naming conventions and things like that  that i ve been trying to keep actually up to date 
 none 	so 
 none 	and i ve been sharing them with u_d  u_w folks also 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i m sorry  you ve been what  showing them  sharing them  o_k 
 none 	sharing them with the u_w folks 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well  maybe uh  since that   that was a pretty short one  maybe we should talk about the i_b_m transcription status  someone can fill in liz and andreas later  uh
 none 	o_k  so  we  uh   we did another version of the beeps  where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit 
 none 	chuck came up here and recorded some di  himself speaking some digits  and so it just goes  beep one beep  and then the phrase  and then  beep two beep  and then the phrase 
 none 	and that seems pretty good 
 none 	um 
 none 	i think they ll have a b  easier time keeping track of where they are in the file 
 none 	and we have done that on the automatic segmentations 
 none 	and we did it with the automatic segmentation  and i don t think   we ne  we didn t look at it in detail 
 none 	we just sent it to i_b_m  we   we sorta spot checked it 
 none 	i listened to probably  uh  five or ten minutes of it from the beginning 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  really  o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  
 none 	i sorta spot checked here and there and it sounded pretty good 
 none 	so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i think it ll work 
 none 	and  uh  we ll just hafta see what we get back from them 
 none 	uh  
 none 	and the main thing will be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them 
 none 	i mean  that s the crucial part 
 none 	right 
 none 	and i think we ll be able to do that at   with this new beep format 
 none 	yep 
 none 	well  i think it s also they are much less likely to d  have errors 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i mean  so the problem wi  last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren t any  or   and they put in extraneous beeps 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and with the numbers there  it s much less likely 
 none 	yeah  one interesting note is   uh  or problem   i dunno if this was just because of how i play it back  i say  uh  s_n_d play and then the file  every once in a while  uh  like a beep sounds like it s cut into two beeps 
 none 	yeah  into two pieces  yeah 
 none 	yeah  and
 none 	yep 
 none 	i   i dunno if that s an  uh  artifact of playback   bu  uh  i don t think it s probably in the original file 
 none 	um  but  uh  
 none 	i recognize that  too 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	ha  that s interesting  i didn t hear that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but with this new format  um  that hopefully they re not hearing that  and if they are  it shouldn t throw them 
 none 	yep 
 none 	so 
 none 	well  maybe we better listen to it again  make sure  but 
 none 	i mean  certainly the software shouldn t do that  so 
 none 	yeah  that s what i thought  i  it s probably just  you know  mmm  somehow the audio device gets hung for a second  or  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  some latency or something  yeah 
 none 	hiccups 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	as long as they have one number  and they know that there s only one beep maximum that goes with that number 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  the only   the only part that might be confusing is when chuck is reading digits 
 none 	right 
 none 	yep 
 none 	right 
 none 	so th 
 none 	well  you know  actually  are we having them  
 none 	 seven four eight beep seven beep eight three two  
 none 	yeah  but are we having them do digits 
 none 	yes 
 none 	because  uh  we don t   we didn t  
 none 	we   we didn t cut those out 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	they are not transcribed yet  so  yeah 
 none 	in order to cut them out we d have to listen to it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and we wanted to avoid doing that  so we   they are transcribing the digits 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	although we could tell them   we could tell them  if you hear someone reading a digits string just say
 none 	we can   we can ignore it when we get it back  huh 
 none 	 bracket digit bracket  and don t bother actually computing the di  writing down the digits 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that d be great  that d be what i m having the transcribers here do  cuz it can be extracted later 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and then i wanted to talk about   but as i said i   we may not have time   what we should do about digits  we have a whole pile of digits that haven t been transcribed 
 none 	le  let s talk about it  because that s   that s something that i   i know andreas is less interested in than liz is  so  you know 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	do we have anything else to say about transcription 
 none 	it s good  
 none 	about i_b_m stuff 
 none 	uh  brian   i  
 none 	i sent bresset   sent brian a message about the meeting and i haven t heard back yet 
 none 	so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i g  hope he got it and hopefully he s   maybe he s gone  i dunno  he didn t even reply to my message  so 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i should probably ping him just to make sure that he got it 
 none 	alright 
 none 	so  we have a whole bunch of digits  if we wanna move on to digits 
 none 	actually  maybe i   one   one relate  more related thing in transcription  so that s the i_b_m stuff  we ve got that sorted out 
 none 	um  how re we doing on the   on the rest of it 
 none 	we re doing well 
 none 	i   i hire   i ve hired two extra people already  expect to hire two more 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and  um 
 none 	i ve prepared  um  uh  a set of five which i m   which i m calling set two  which are now being edited by my head transcriber  in terms of spelling errors and all that  she s also checking through and mar  and   and monitoring  um  the transcription of another transcriber 
 none 	you know  i mean  she s going through and doing these kinds of checks 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	and 
 none 	i ve moved on now to what i m calling set three  i sort of thought if i do it in sets   groups of five  then i can have  like  sort of a   a parallel processing through   through the   the current 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	and   and you indicated to me that we have a g  a goal now  for the   for the  um  the  uh  darpa demo  of twenty hours 
 none 	so  i m gonna go up to twenty hours  be sure that everything gets processed  and released  and   and that s   that s what my goal is  package of twenty hours right now  and then once that s done  move on to the next 
 none 	yeah  uh  so twenty hours  but i guess the other thing is that  um  that   that s kinda twenty hours a_sap because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hours  the more time it ll be for people to actually do cool things with it 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so 
 none 	good 
 none 	i m   i m hiring people who  uh  really are  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	they would like to do it full time  several of these people 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and   and i don t think it s possible  really  to do this full time  but  that   what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible 
 none 	it ll keep your accuracy up 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and they re really excellent 
 none 	well  that s good 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i mean  i guess the  
 none 	got a good core group now 
 none 	so the difference if   if  um  if the i_b_m stuff works out  the difference in the job would be that they p  primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else  is that most of what it    
 none 	again 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and correcting 
 none 	i mean  
 none 	correcting 
 none 	correcting  we ll   we ll expect that they ll have to move some time bins and do some corrections 
 none 	and i   you know  i ve also d  uh  discovered  
 none 	so with the new transcriber i m   um  
 none 	so  
 none 	uh  lemme say that my  uh  
 none 	so  um  
 none 	at present  um  the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time 
 none 	and  that sort of  um  is useful  and t  you know  and then once in a while they ll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up 
 none 	o_k  well 
 none 	i realize that  um  w  i  we  we re using the pre segmented version  and  um  the pre segmented version is extremely useful  and wouldn t it be  useful also to have the visual representation of those segments 
 none 	and so i ve   uh  i  uh  uh  i ve trained the new one   uh  the new  the newest one  to  um  use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time 
 none 	and that s just amazingly helpful 
 none 	because what happens then  is you scan across the signal and once in a while you ll find a blip that didn t show up in the pre segmentation 
 none 	oh  right  i see what you mean 
 none 	and that ll be something like  
 none 	i  it s ver    it s interesting 
 none 	a backchannel  or  
 none 	once in a while it s a backchannel  sometimes it seems to be  um  similar to the ones that are being picked up 
 none 	yep 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and they re rare events  but you can really go through a meeting very quickly  you just   you just  you know  yo  you s  you scroll from screen to screen  looking for blips 
 none 	and 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think that we re gonna end up with  uh better coverage of the backchannels  but at the same time we re benefitting tremendously from the pre segmentation because there are huge places where there is just absolutely no activity at all 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  uh  the audio quality is so good  
 none 	so they can   they can  um  scroll through that pretty quick 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	that s great 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so i think that that s gonna  also eh  you know  speed the efficiency of this part of the process 
 none 	hmm  o_k 
 none 	uh  yeah 
 none 	so  uh  
 none 	yeah  so let s talk about the digits  since they re not here yet 
 none 	uh  so  we have a whole bunch of digits that we ve read and we have the forms and so on  um  but only a small number of that ha  well  not a small number   only a subset of that has been transcribed  and so we need to decide what we wanna do 
 none 	and  uh 
 none 	liz and andreas   actually they re not here  but  they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment 
 none 	and  again  i don t think we ll be able to do with that alone  because  um  sometimes people correct themselves and things like that 
 none 	but   so  i was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits  doing a forced alignment  and doing the timing 
 none 	well  forced alignment would be one thing  what about just actually doing recognition 
 none 	well  we   we know what they read  because we have the forms 
 none 	no  they make mistakes 
 none 	right 
 none 	but  the point is that we wanna get a set of clean digits 
 none 	right 
 none 	you re talking about as a pre processing step  right  morgan 
 none 	um  
 none 	is that what you re    
 none 	yeah  i m   i m not quite sure what i m talking about  i mean  
 none 	i  
 none 	i mean  uh  we re talking about digits now  and   and so  um  there s a bunch of stuff that hasn t been marked yet 
 none 	uh 
 none 	and  um  there s the issue that   that they   we know what   what was said  but do we  because people make mistakes and stuff 
 none 	i mean  so one option i 
 none 	i was just asking  just out of curiosity  if   if with  uh   uh  the s_r_i recognizer getting one percent word error  uh  would we   would we do better    
 none 	so  if you do a forced alignment but the force  but the   but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes  uh  or false starts  it s   it s much less c  it s much less common than one percent 
 none 	but that s pretty uncommon 
 none 	um  if we could really get one percent on  
 none 	well 
 none 	we should be able to  right 
 none 	i guess   yeah  i guess if we segmented it  we could get one percent on digits 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so that s just my question  i m not saying it should be one way or the other  but it s   if  
 none 	but 
 none 	well  there   there re a couple different of doing it  we could use the tools i ve already developed and transcribe it  hire some people  or use the transcribers to do it  we could let i_b_m transcribe it 
 none 	you know  they re doing it anyway  and unless we tell them different  they re gonna transcribe it 
 none 	um  or we could try some automated methods 
 none 	and my   my tendency right now is  well  if i_b_m comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good  just let them do it 
 none 	well  
 none 	yeah  it s   y  you raised a point  kind of  uh  euphemistically   but  i mean  m  maybe it is a serious problem  ho  what will they do when they go   hear
 none 	 beep seven beep seven three five two    i mean  you think they ll   we ll get    
 none 	it s pretty distinct 
 none 	the beeps are pre recorded 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it ll only be a problem for m  for mine 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well it   it   well  it d be preceded by  i m reading transcript so and so  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yes 
 none 	so 
 none 	i think if they re processing it at  
 none 	i mean  it ll be   it will be in the midst of a digit string 
 none 	so  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean it   sure  there   there might be a place where it s
 none 	 beep seven beep eight beep eight beep  
 none 	but  you know  they   they re   they re gonna macros for inserting the beep marks 
 none 	and so  i   i don t think it ll be a problem  we ll have to see  but i don t think it s gonna be a problem 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well  i   i   i dunno  i   i think that that s   if they are in fact going to transcribe these things  uh  certainly any process that we d have to correct them  or whatever is   needs to be much less elaborate for digits than for other stuff  so  why not 
 none 	right 
 none 	sure 
 none 	that was it 
 none 	that was it 
 none 	just  what do we do with digits  we have so many of them  and it d be nice to actually do something with them 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well  we   we   we wanna have them 
 none 	you mean there re more than ten 
 none 	yeah  i  
 none 	anything else 
 none 	your mike is a little low there 
 none 	i  in berkeley  yeah 
 none 	so  uh
 none 	you   you have to go a little early  right 
 none 	well  i can stay till about  uh  three forty 
 none 	at twenty  
 none 	alright  so le  let s make sure we do the ones that   that  uh  saved you  so there was some  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh
 none 	in   in  
 none 	adam s agenda list  he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition 
 none 	well  yeah  so this is just partly to inform everybody  um  and   and of course to get  um  input 
 none 	oops 
 none 	um  so  uh  we had a discussion  
 none 	don and
 none 	liz and i had discussion last week about how to proceed with  uh  you know  with don s work  and   and   and  uh  one of the obvious things that occur to us was that we re   since we now have thilo s segmenter and it works  you know  amazingly well  um  we should actually basically re evaluate the recognition  um  results using   you know  without cheating on the segmentations 
 none 	ch 
 none 	and  that should be fairly  
 none 	so  
 none 	and how do we find the transcripts for those so that    
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	the references for   for those segments 
 none 	so  there s actually  
 none 	it s not that  
 none 	why do you ask 
 none 	no  actually  um 
 none 	i could  
 none 	well  
 none 	hand ones 
 none 	nist has  um m  a fairly sophisticated scoring program that you can give a  um   a time  uh  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	you know  you basically just give two time marked sequences of words  and it computes the um   the  uh   you know  the   the   th  it does all the work for you 
 none 	it does all the work for you 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  it   we just   and we use that actually in hub five to do the scoring 
 none 	um  so what we ve been using so far was sort of a simplified version of the scoring 
 none 	and we can   we can handle the   the   the type of problem we have here 
 none 	so  we ha 
 none 	so  basically you give some time constraints for   for the references and for   for the hypothesis  and   yeah  o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  maybe the start of your speech and the end of it  or stuff like that 
 none 	so do 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	it does time constrained word alignment 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so 
 none 	so that should be possible 
 none 	i mean that shouldn t be a problem 
 none 	uh  so that was the one thing  and the other was that  um  
 none 	what was the other problem  oh 
 none 	that
 none 	thilo wanted to use the recognizer alignments to train up his  um  speech detector 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  so that we could use  uh   you know there wouldn t be so much hand labeling needed to  uh   to generate training data for   for the speech detector 
 none 	yeah  i m just in progress of   of doing that  so 
 none 	and i think you re in the process of doing that  so  you can   you can  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it ll give you a lot more data  too  won t it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  it s basically   s 
 none 	i think  eight meetings or something which   which i m using  and  it s   before it was twenty minutes of one meeting  so   should be a little bit better 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	that won t be perfect   the alignments aren t perfect  but  um  it s probably still better to have all this extra data  than   yeah 
 none 	great 
 none 	yeah  but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	we ll see that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	actually  i had a question about that  if you find that you can lower the false alarms that you get where there s no speech  that would be useful for us to know  so  um  
 none 	there were the false alarms 
 none 	yeah  so  r  right now you get f  fal  you know  false   false  uh  speech regions when it s just like  um  breath or something like that  and i d be interested to know the   wha  if you retrain um  do those actually go down or not  because of  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i ll   can make   an  can  like  make a c  comparison of   of the old system to the   to the new one  and then   yeah 
 none 	yeah  just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of   just having that training data wh  what happens 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	um another one that we had on
 none 	adam s agenda that definitely involved you was s  something about smartkom 
 none 	right  so 
 none 	rob porzel   eh  porzel  and the  uh  
 none 	porzel 
 none 	porzel   and the  uh 
 none 	porzel 
 none 	smartkom group are collecting some dialogues  basically they have one person sitting in here  looking at a picture  and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere 
 none 	and  uh  they re doing a travel task 
 none 	and  uh  it involves starting   i believe starting with a  
 none 	it s   it s always the wizard  but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a  uh  speech generation system 
 none 	yeah  actually  it s changed to a synthesis for   for the first part now  yeah 
 none 	synthesis system 
 none 	um  and then  it goes to a real wizard and they re evaluating that  and they wanted to use this equipment  and so the w  question came up  is   well  here s some more data  should this be part of the corpus or not 
 none 	and my attitude was yes  because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustics  as opposed to just for language 
 none 	um  or also for dialogue of various sorts 
 none 	um  so it s not a meeting  right  because it s two people and they re not face to face 
 none 	wait a minute  so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i just wanted to understand it  cuz i  
 none 	i m   uh  hadn t quite followed this process  um 
 none 	so  it s wizard in the sen  usual sense that the person who is asking the questions doesn t know that it s  uh  a machi  not a machine 
 none 	right 
 none 	actually   actually  w  w  the   the   we do this   i dunno who came up with it  but i think it s a really clever idea 
 none 	at the beginning 
 none 	we simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session  and so then after that  the person s told that they re now talking to a  uh   to a human 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s a human operator 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but of course they don t know that it s the same person both times 
 none 	so  we   we collect   we collect both human computer and human human data  essentially  in the same session 
 none 	you might wanna try collecting it the other way around sometime  saying that th  the computer isn t up yet and then   so then you can separate it out whether it s the beginning or end kind of effects  but  yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	that s an idea 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s a good idea 
 none 	 i have to go now  you can talk to the computer  
 none 	 no  
 none 	it s a lot more believable  too  if you tell them that they re   the computer part is running on a windows machine 
 none 	and the whole breakdown thing kinda makes sense 
 none 	o 
 none 	just   just reboot it 
 none 	abort   abort  retry  fail 
 none 	so did they actually save the far field data  cuz at first they weren t   they weren t sa  o_k 
 none 	well  this was   this was the question  so   so they were saying they were not going to  and i said   well that s silly  if   if we re gonna try to do it for a corpus  there might be people who are interested in acoustics  
 none 	yes 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	wow 
 none 	no 
 none 	or  
 none 	projector
 none 	yeah 
 none 	s 
 none 	we were not saying we are not doing it  we wer  we just wanted to do  
 none 	no  the   the question is do we save one or two far field channels or all of them 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i   i see no reason not to do all of them 
 none 	that   that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies  uh  it s nice to have the same for every recording 
 none 	um  
 none 	nnn 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  what is the purpose of this recording 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	this is to get acoustic and language model training data for smartkom 
 none 	it s to be traini  to b  training data and development data for the smartkom system 
 none 	the english system 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	where does this    
 none 	maybe we can have him vary the microphones  too  or they re different s  speakers 
 none 	well  so why not    
 none 	b 
 none 	right  so   so   so for their usage  they don t need anything 
 none 	yeah  but   but i m not sure about the legal aspect of   of that  is   is there some contract with smartkom or something about the data  what they   or  is   is that our data which we are collecting here  or    
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we ve never signed anything that said that we couldn t use anything that we did 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	we weren t supposed to collect any data 
 none 	so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	this was all  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  yeah  th  th  that was the question  if   if     yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	basically 
 none 	no that s not a problem  i   l  look  it seems to me that if we re doing it anyway and we re doing it for these   these purposes that we have  and we have these distant mikes  we definitely should re  should save it all as long as we ve got disk space  and disk is pretty cheap  so should we save it 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and then  
 none 	now th  yeah 
 none 	so we save it because it s   it   it s potentially useful 
 none 	right 
 none 	and now  what do we do with it is   is a s  separate question 
 none 	i mean  anybody who s training something up could choose to put it   eh  to u  include this or not  i   i would not say it was part of the meetings corpus  it isn t 
 none 	right 
 none 	but it s some other data we have  and if somebody doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can  right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so it s  
 none 	it   it  
 none 	i guess it   the   begs the question of what is the meeting corpus  so if  at u_w they start recording two person hallway conversations is that part of the meeting corpus 
 none 	i think it s   i  
 none 	i think   i th  think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key 
 none 	well  this has two or more people conversing with each other  they re just not face to face 
 none 	nnn  well
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what if we just give it a   a name like we give these meetings a name 
 none 	well this  
 none 	no  it doesn t  right  it has  
 none 	i mean  that was my intention 
 none 	and then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people won t  and  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that was my intention  so   so   s  so part of the reason that i wanted to bring this up is  do we wanna handle it as a special case or do we wanna fold it in  we  give everyone who s involved as their own user i_d  give it session i_ds  let all the tools that handle meeting recorder handle it  or do we wanna special case it  and if we were gonna special case it  who s gonna do that 
 none 	well this  
 none 	just give it a title 
 none 	oh 
 none 	i think it is a s 
 none 	well  it   it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure  since we don t want to duplicate things unnecessarily  but as far as distributing it  we shouldn t label it as part of this meeting corpus  we should let it be its own corp 
 none 	so  it   it   it  
 none 	i think  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i don t see why not  it s just a different topic 
 none 	well it s   it   well  because  
 none 	i ha  i have an extra point  which is the naturalness issue 
 none 	because we have  like  meetings that have a reason  that s one of the reasons that we were talking about this  and   and those   and this sounds like it s more of an experimental setup  it s got a different purpose 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s scenario based  it s   it s human computer interface   it s really pretty different  but i  i   i have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they re gonna do  but i don t think i  it   it doesn t match anything that we ve described about meetings 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	whereas everything that we talked about them doing at   at u_w and so forth really does  they re actually talking  
 none 	o_k  so w  so what does that mean for how we are gonna organize things 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you can   you can   again  as   as i think andreas was saying  if you wanna use the same tools and the same conventions  there s no problem with that  it s just that it s  you know  different directory  it s called something different  it s   you know 
 none 	it is different 
 none 	you can t just fold it in as if it s   i mean  digits are different  too  right 
 none 	it might also be potentially confusing 
 none 	yeah  but those are folded in  and it s just   you just mark the transcripts differently  so   so one option is you fold it in  and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction  rather than another type of interaction 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  i th 
 none 	well  i don  i wouldn t call reading digits  meetings  
 none 	right  i mean  we   we   we were doing  
 none 	well  but   but 
 none 	i put it under the same directory tree  you know  it s in  user doctor speech data m_r  
 none 	well  
 none 	can we just have a directory called  like   other stuff  
 none 	and  
 none 	other 
 none 	well   or  i dunno 
 none 	i mean  i don t care what directory tree you have it under  right  i mean that s just a  
 none 	and   and just  um  store it there  i mean  
 none 	o_k  my preference is to have a single procedure so that i don t have to think too much about things 
 none 	yes 
 none 	and  just have a marking 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	if we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure  and someone has to do that 
 none 	o_ 
 none 	you   you can use whatever procedure you want that s p  convenient for you  all i m saying is that there s no way that we re gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings 
 none 	right 
 none 	and similarly we re not gonna tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings 
 none 	those aren t meetings 
 none 	but if it makes it easier for you to pu  fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree  knock yourself out  you know 
 none 	there s a couple other questions that i have too  and   and one of them is  what about  uh  consent issues 
 none 	and the other one is  what about transcription 
 none 	transcription is done in munich 
 none 	are    
 none 	o_k  so we don t have to worry about transcribing it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	alright 
 none 	so  w  we will hafta worry about format 
 none 	that s a   that s another argument to keep it separate  because it s gonna follow the smartkom transcription conventions and not the
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	icsi meeting transcription conventions 
 none 	ah 
 none 	o_k  well  i didn t realize that  that s   that s a  
 none 	good point 
 none 	good point 
 none 	but i m sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or   or some things 
 none 	um 
 none 	do we h  do we have  uh  um 
 none 	american born folk  uh  reading german  
 none 	german  uh  pla  uh  place names and so forth  is that    
 none 	yeah 
 none 	exactly 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  great 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	they   they even have a reading list  it s pretty funny 
 none 	i bet that sounds good  huh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you can do that if you want 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i dunno if you want that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	heidelberg
 none 	exactly
 none 	disk might eventually be an issue so we might   we   we might need to  uh  get some more disk pretty soon  we re about   we re about half   halfway through our disk right now 
 none 	do you wanna be a subject 
 none 	yeah  i be pretty good 
 none 	we  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that was one of our concerns 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	are we only half  i thought we were more than that 
 none 	we re probably a little more than that because we re using up some space that we shouldn t be on 
 none 	so  once everything gets converted over to the disks we re supposed to be using we ll be probably  uh  seventy five percent 
 none 	well  when i was looking for space for thilo  i found one disk that had  uh 
 none 	i think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and everything else was sorta committed 
 none 	uh  
 none 	were those backed up or non backed up 
 none 	those were non backed up 
 none 	non back up 
 none 	right  so that s different 
 none 	s  oh  you re talking about backed up 
 none 	i m much more concerned about the backed up 
 none 	the non backed up  yeah  i  is cheap  i mean  if we need to we can buy a disk  hang it off a s  uh  workstation  if it s not backed up the sysadmins don t care too much 
 none 	i haven t looked to see how much of that we have 
 none 	yeah  so  i mean  pretty much anytime we need a disk  we can get it at the rate that we re  
 none 	you can  
 none 	i shouldn t be saying this  but  you can just   you know  since the back ups are every night  you can recycle the backed up diskspace 
 none 	yeah  but that s   that s   that s risky 
 none 	yeah  you really shouldn t be saying  
 none 	mmm  mmm 
 none 	i didn t say that  i didn t say that 
 none 	yeah  that s right  beep that out 
 none 	da  we had allowed dave to listen to these   these  uh  recordings  um  
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  i me  and there s been this conversation going on about getting another file server  and   and we can do that 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	we ll take the opportunity and get another big raft of   of disk  i guess 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well 
 none 	it s really the back up issue rather than the file server issue 
 none 	i think  
 none 	i think there s an argument for having   you know  you could use our old file server for   for disks that have data that is very rarely accessed  and then have a fast new file server for data that is  um  heavily accessed 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	my understanding is  the issue isn t really the file server  we could always put more disks on  it s the back up system 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s the back  it s the back up capaci  yeah 
 none 	so   which is near saturation  apparently 
 none 	so 
 none 	soon 
 none 	i think   i think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines  and we ve got  you know  fifty machines trying to access data off of abbott at once 
 none 	well  we re alright for now because the network s so slow 
 none 	i mean  i think   i think we ve raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it  but the  
 none 	what about putting the stuff on  like  c_  c_d rom or d_v_d or something 
 none 	yeah  that was me 
 none 	i was the one who said it was not reliable  the  they   they wear out 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	yeah  the   the   th 
 none 	but they wear out just from sitting on the shelf 
 none 	yep 
 none 	absolutely 
 none 	or from being read and read 
 none 	no 
 none 	read and write don t hurt them too much unless you scratch them 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	but the r  the write once  and the read writes  don t last 
 none 	so you don t wa  you don t wanna put ir  un  reproduceable data on them 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	wear out after what amount of time 
 none 	year or two 
 none 	would it be    
 none 	year or two 
 none 	yep 
 none 	wow 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	but if that   then you would think you d hear much more clamoring about data loss and  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  yeah  all the l_ 
 none 	i   i don t know many people who do it on c_d 
 none 	i mean  they re   the most   fo 
 none 	l_d_c  all the l_d_c distributions are on c_d rom 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	they re on c_d  but they re not   tha  that s not the only source  they have them on disk 
 none 	like  
 none 	and they burn new ones every once in a while  but if you go   if you go k 
 none 	but  you know  we have  
 none 	but we have like thirty you know  from ten years ago  no 
 none 	we have all sorts of c_d roms from a long time ago 
 none 	yeah  ten years ago  ninety one  and they re still all fine 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  th  th 
 none 	were they burned or were they pressed 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  both  i ve burned them and they re still o_k  i mean  usually they re  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  the   the pressed ones last for  well  not forever  they ve been finding even those degrade 
 none 	oh  i see 
 none 	but  uh  the burned ones   i mean  when i say two or three years what i m saying is that
 none 	that s what i  
 none 	i have had disks which are gone in a year 
 none 	on the average  it ll probably be three or four years 
 none 	but  uh   i   i   you don t want to per  p  have your only copy on a media that fails 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	and they do 
 none 	so how about    
 none 	um  if you have them professionally pressed  y  you know  they re good for decades 
 none 	so   so how about putting them on that plus  like on a   on   on dat or some other medium that isn t risky  
 none 	i think th  um  we can already put them on tape 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and the tape is hi  is very reliable 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so the   the only issue is then if we need access to them 
 none 	right 
 none 	so that s fine f  if we don t need access to them 
 none 	well  if   if   if you   if they last  
 none 	say  they actually last  like  five years  huh  in   in the typical case  and   and occasionally you might need to recreate one  and then you get your tape out  but otherwise you don t 
 none 	can t you just   you just put them on    
 none 	so you just archive it on the tape  and then put it on c_d as well 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	oh  so you re just saying put them on c_ds for normal access 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  you can do that but that s pretty annoying  because the c_ds are so slow 
 none 	what you  
 none 	see  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what d be nice is a system that re burned the c_ds every year 
 none 	h  everytime it was a  gonna     gonna die  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  i mean  the c_ds are   are an op 
 none 	well  
 none 	it s like   like dynamic ra  d_ram 
 none 	just before 
 none 	just before they  be  before it goes bad  it burns them in 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the   the c_d is an alternative to tape  icsi already has a perfectly good tape system and it s more reliable 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you know  
 none 	so for archiving  we ll just use tape 
 none 	one   one thing i don t understand is  if you have the data   if   if you  if the meeting data is put on disk exactly once  then it s backed up once and the back up system should never have to bother with it  uh  more than once 
 none 	i would think  
 none 	well  regardless   well  first of all there was  um  a problem with the archive in that i was every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directories an  or recursive chmod and chown  because they weren t getting set correctly every once in a while  and i was just  doing a minus r_ star  not realizing that that caused it to be re backed up 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	ah 
 none 	but normally you re correct 
 none 	but even without that  the back up system is becoming saturated 
 none 	but   but this back up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn t changed and doesn t need to be backed up again 
 none 	sure  but we still have enough changed that the nightly back ups are starting to take too long 
 none 	the b 
 none 	i think th  the   at least the once tha  that you put it on  it would   it would kill that  so 
 none 	o_k  so   so then  if   so   so then  let s   right 
 none 	it has nothing to do with the meeting  it s just the general icsi back up system is becoming saturated 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  what if we buy  uh   uh  what   what do they call these  um high density    
 none 	well  why don t you have this   have a   this conversation with dave johnson tha  rather than with me 
 none 	no  no  because this is maybe something that we can do without involving dave  and   and  putting more burden on him 
 none 	how about we buy  uh   uh   uh  one of these high density tape drives 
 none 	and we put the data actually on non backed up disks 
 none 	and we do our own back up once and for all   all  and then   and we don t have to bother this  up 
 none 	actually  you know  we could do that just with the tape   with the current tape 
 none 	i dunno what the  these tapes   uh  at some point these  
 none 	i dunno  what kind of tape drive is it  is it   is    
 none 	i dunno but it s an automatic robot so it s very convenient 
 none 	wh 
 none 	right 
 none 	you just run a program to restore them 
 none 	the o  the one that we have 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but it might interfere with their back up schedule  eh 
 none 	the   i mean  
 none 	but  
 none 	no  we have s  we   don t we have our own  something wi  th  that doesn t   that isn t used by the back up gang 
 none 	don t we have something downstairs 
 none 	well they  
 none 	what kinda tape drive 
 none 	just in    
 none 	well   but   no  but andreas s point is a good one  and we don t have to do anything ourselves to do that  they re already right now on tape 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	right  so your   your point is  and i think it s a good one  that we could just get more disk and put it there 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	on an x_h   uh  x_   x_ whatever partition  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s not a bad idea 
 none 	yeah  that s basically what i was gonna say  is that a disk is   is so cheap it s es  essentially  you know  close to free 
 none 	so once it s on tape  
 none 	right 
 none 	and the only thing that costs is the back up issue  eh  to first order  and we can take care of that by putting it on non back  up drives and just backing it up once onto this tape 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i think that s a good idea 
 none 	right 
 none 	oh  yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	good 
 none 	it s good 
 none 	so  who s gonna do these back ups  the people that collect it 
 none 	uh
 none 	well  i ll talk to dave  and   and see what th  how   what the best way of doing that is 
 none 	it s probably gonna n 
 none 	there s a little utility that will manually burn a tape for you  and that s probably the right way to do it 
 none 	yeah  and we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meetings 
 none 	well  s 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  that s what i m wondering  if  
 none 	well we re g  we re gonna automate that  my intention is to do a script that ll do everything 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i mean  you don t have to physically put a tape in the drive  or s   
 none 	no 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	it s all tape robot  so you just sit down at your computer and you type a command 
 none 	so it s just  
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	yeah  but then you re effectively using the resources of the back up system 
 none 	or is that a different tape robot 
 none 	but not at the same time 
 none 	yeah  but y  but you would be anyway 
 none 	no  no  see  
 none 	right  because  
 none 	no  no  no  he s saying get a whole different drive 
 none 	yeah  just give a dedi 
 none 	but there s no reason to do that 
 none 	well  i m saying is i  if you go to dave  and   and   and ask him  can i use your tape robot    he will say 
 none 	it   we already have it there and it   it s  
 none 	 well that s gonna screw up our back up operation  
 none 	no  we won t 
 none 	he ll say
 none 	 if   if that means that it s not gonna be backed up standardly  great  
 none 	he  i  
 none 	dave has   has promoted this in the past  so i don t think he s actually against it  yeah 
 none 	yeah  it s   it s definitely no problem 
 none 	oh  o_k  alright 
 none 	alright 
 none 	good 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	what about if the times overlap with the normal back up time 
 none 	um  it s   it s just   it s just a utility which queues up 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	it just queues it up and   and when it s available  it will copy it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can  you know  do it a  a few days later or whatever you wanna do  after you confirm that it s really backed up 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	n_w    
 none 	you saying n_w archive 
 none 	n_w archive  that s what it is 
 none 	yep
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back ups 
 none 	right 
 none 	and then there wouldn t be this extra load 
 none 	well  it   if he   you have to put the data on a   on a non backed up disk to begin with 
 none 	so that   so that   otherwise you don t   you  
 none 	right 
 none 	well  but you can have it n_w archive to   you can have  uh  a non backed up disk n_w archived  and it ll never show up on the nightly back ups 
 none 	right 
 none 	and then it never  
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	which i m sure would make ever  the sysadmins very happy 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  i think that s a good idea 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	that s what we should do 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  that means we ll probably wanna convert all   all those files   filesystems to non backed up media 
 none 	that sounds good 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  another  thing on the agenda said
 none 	s_r_i recognition experiments 
 none 	what s that 
 none 	s_r_i recognition  oh 
 none 	that wasn t me 
 none 	um  well  we have lots of them 
 none 	uh  who s that 
 none 	uh 
 none 	i dunno  chuck  do you have any   any updates 
 none 	n  i m successfully  uh  increasing the error rate 
 none 	uh  
 none 	that s good 
 none 	oh 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	lift the herve approach 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  i mean i m just playing with  um  the number of gaussians that we use in the   the recognizer  and  
 none 	well  you have to sa  you have to tell people that you re   you re doing   you re trying the tandem features 
 none 	yes  i m using tandem features 
 none 	oh you are  cool 
 none 	a  and i m still tinkering with the p_l_p features 
 none 	and  
 none 	yeah  i got confused by the results  it sai  because   uh  the meeting before  you said  o_k  we got it down to where they re   they re within a tenth of a percent  
 none 	that was on males 
 none 	right 
 none 	that was   that was before i tried it on the females 
 none 	oh 
 none 	see  women are nothi  are  trouble  right  as we all know  so 
 none 	it s the women are the problem  o_k 
 none 	well  let s just say that men are simple 
 none 	so   so  when  
 none 	so i   i had  
 none 	that was a quick response 
 none 	i ha 
 none 	so  we had reached the point where   we had reached the point where  um  on the male portion of the development set  the  um   or one of the development sets  i should say   the  um   the male error rate with  uh  icsi p_l_p features was pretty much identical with  uh  s_r_i features  which are m_f_c_c  so  um  then i thought   oh  great 
 none 	i m well rehearsed 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i ll j  i ll   just let s make sure everything works on the females   and the error rate   you know  there was a three percent difference 
 none 	oh 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	so  uh  
 none 	is there less training data 
 none 	no  actually there s more training data 
 none 	i mean  we don 
 none 	this is on just digits 
 none 	no  no 
 none 	oh  sorry  o_k  this is on   oh  o_k 
 none 	no 
 none 	no  it s  uh  swi 
 none 	hub five 
 none 	this is hub five 
 none 	hub five  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  and the test data is callhome and switchboard 
 none 	so  uh   so then um  
 none 	oh  and plus the   the vocal tract length normalization didn t   actually made things worse 
 none 	so something s really seriously wrong  so  
 none 	um  
 none 	aha 
 none 	hhh 
 none 	so  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  
 none 	so   but you see  now  between   between the males and the females  there s certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range  than there is  say  just within the males 
 none 	and what you were using before was scaling factors that were just from the   the m  the s_r_i front end 
 none 	and that worked   that worked fine 
 none 	that s true 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  but now you re looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine 
 none 	well  um  
 none 	so  
 none 	i just   d  so the one thing that i then tried was to put in the low pass filter  which we have in the  
 none 	so  most   most
 none 	hub five systems actually band limit the   uh  at about  uh  thirty seven hundred  um  hertz 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	although  you know  normally  i mean  the channel goes to four   four thousand  right  so  um  
 none 	and that actually helped  uh   uh  a little bit 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	um and it didn t hurt on the males either  so  um  
 none 	and i m now  uh  trying the  
 none 	oh  and suddenly  also the v  the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se  on the test data 
 none 	so  you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test  and s  more if you do it on both training and test 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and so the  
 none 	it now helps  if you do it only on the test  and
 none 	i m currently retraining another set of models where it s both in the training and the test  and then we ll   we ll have  hopefully  even better results  so  
 none 	but there s  
 none 	it looks like there will still be some difference  maybe between one and two percent  um  for the females  and so  um  you know  i m open to suggestions 
 none 	huh 
 none 	and it is true that the  uh   that the   you know  we are using the  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but   it can t be just the
 none 	v_t_l  because if you don t do v_t_l in both systems  uh  you know  the   the females are considerably worse in the   with the p_l_p features 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	no   no  i   i remember that 
 none 	it s much worse 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so there must be some   something else going on 
 none 	well  what s the standard    
 none 	yeah  so i thought the performance was actually a little better on females than males 
 none 	that s what i thought  too 
 none 	um  that ye  overall  yes  but on this particular development test set  they re actually a little worse 
 none 	but that s beside the point  we re looking at the discrepancy between the s_r_i system and the
 none 	s_r_i system when trained with icsi features 
 none 	right  i m just wondering if that   if   if you have any indication of your standard features  you know  if that s also different or in the same direction or not 
 none 	what s   are the freq   
 none 	you re  
 none 	this is   lemme ask a q  more basic que  i mean  is this  uh   uh  iterative 
 none 	cuz  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	baum welch training  or is it viterbi training  or    
 none 	it s baum welch training 
 none 	baum welch training 
 none 	and how do you determine when to   to stop iterating 
 none 	um  
 none 	well  actually  we   we just basically do a s  a fixed number of iterations 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	uh  in this case four 
 none 	um  which  
 none 	eh  we used to do only three  and then we found out we can squeeze  
 none 	and it was basically  we re s  we re keeping it on the safe side  but you re d  right  it might be that one more iteration would   would help  but it s sort of you know 
 none 	or maybe   or maybe you re doing one too many  i mean it s   it s  
 none 	no  but with  baum welch   there shouldn t be an over fitting issue  really 
 none 	uh  well  there can be  sure 
 none 	um 
 none 	well  you can try each one on a  cross validation set   can t you 
 search 	it d  if you   if you remember some years ago  bill byrne  did a thing where he was   he was looking at that  and he showed that you could get it   so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but   but   but  um  
 none 	well  yeah  we can  
 none 	well  that s   that s the easy one to check  because we save all the intermediate models and we can  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	do you    
 none 	and in each case  ho  um  i m sorry   in each case how do you determine  you know  the   the usual fudge factors  the  uh   the  uh  language  uh  scaling  acoustic scaling  uh  uh  
 none 	what    
 none 	um i uh  
 none 	i m actually re optimizing them 
 none 	although that hasn t shown to make a big difference 
 none 	o_k  and the pru  the question he was asking at one point about pruning  uh  
 none 	pruning    
 none 	remember that one 
 none 	pruning in the    
 none 	well  he was   he s   it looked like the probabil  at one point he was looking at the probabilities he was getting out   at the likelihoods he was getting out of p_l_p versus mel cepstrum  and they looked pretty different  as i recall 
 none 	yeah  the likelihoods were lower
 none 	oh 
 none 	and so  uh  there s the question  
 none 	for the p_l_p 
 none 	i  you mean   did you see this in the s_r_i system 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um 
 none 	was just looking through the log files  and  
 none 	well  the likelihoods are  
 none 	you can t directly compare them  because  for every set of models you compute a new normalization 
 none 	and so these log probabilities  they aren t directly comparable because you have a different normalization constants for each model you train  so  
 none 	oh 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	but  still it s a question   if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of beam search or something  or    
 none 	well  yeah  that s what i was wondering 
 none 	w  yeah  i mean  
 none 	uh  
 none 	i mean  if you have one threshold that works well because the range of your likelihoods is in this area  
 none 	we prune very conservatively  i mean  as we saw with the meeting data  um we could probably tighten the pruning without really  
 none 	so we  we basically we have a very open beam 
 none 	but  you re only talking about a percent or two  right  here we re  we re saying that we  there   gee  there s this b  eh  there s this difference here 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and it  
 none 	see cuz  i  i  there could be lots of things  right  but   but   but   but  um  let s suppose just for a second that  uh  we ve sort of taken out a lot of the   the major differences  uh  between the two  i mean  we re already sort of using the mel scale and we re using the same style filter integration  and and  well  we re making sure that low and high  
 none 	right 
 none 	course 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	actually  there is   the difference in that  so  for the p_l_p features we use the triangular filter shapes  and for the   in the s_r_i front end we use the trapezoidal one 
 none 	and what s the top frequency of each 
 none 	well  now it s the same 
 none 	it s thirty   thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz 
 none 	yeah  exp  one s triangular  one s trapezoidal  so  
 none 	no  no  but  
 none 	before we   i  i  th  with straight p_l_p  it s trapezoidal also  but then we had a slight difference in the   in the scale 
 none 	well  
 none 	but  
 none 	uh  so 
 none 	since currently the feacalc program doesn t allow me to change the filter shape independently of the scale 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	and 
 none 	i did the experiment on the s_r_i front end where i tried the   y  where the standard used to be to use trapezoidal filters 
 none 	you can actually continuously vary it between the two  and so i wen 
 none 	i swi  i tried the trap  eh  triangular ones 
 none 	and it did slightly worse  but it s really a small difference 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so  
 none 	coup 
 none 	couple tenths of a percent or something  right 
 none 	o_k  so it s not just losing some frequency range 
 none 	yeah  exactly  so  it s not   i don t think the filter shape by itself will make a huge difference 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  so the oth  the other thing that   so  f  i 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we ve always viewed it  anyway  as the major difference between the two  is actually in the smoothing  that the   that the  um 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	p_l_p  and   and the reason p_l_p has been advantageous in  uh  slightly noisy situations is because 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	p_l_p does the smoothing at the end by an auto regressive model  and mel cepstrum does it by just computing the lower cepstral coefficients 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um 
 none 	so  um  
 none 	o_k  so one thing i haven t done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger   with our full training set 
 none 	so right now  we re using a  
 none 	i don t know  forty 
 none 	i  i  it s   it s   eh it s a f  training set that s about  um  you know  by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system  so  some of these smoothing issues are over fitting for that matter  and the baum welch should be much less of a factor  if you go full   whole hog  and so  w  so  just um   so the strategy is to first sort of treat things with fast turn around on a smaller training set and then  when you ve sort of  narrowed it down  you try it on a larger training set  and so  we haven t done that yet 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	could be  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	now the other que  related question  though  is   is  uh  what s the boot models for these things 
 none 	th  th  the boot models are trained from scratch  so we compute  um  
 none 	so  we start with a  um  alil  alignment that we computed with the b  sort of the best system we have 
 none 	and   and then we train from scratch  so we com  we do a  you know  w  um  
 none 	we collect the   uh  the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that   that we train 
 none 	and then  from there we do  um  
 none 	there s a lot of  actually  
 none 	the way it works  you first train a phonetically tied mixture model 
 none 	um 
 none 	you do a total of  
 none 	first you do a context independent
 none 	p_t_m model  then you switch to a context  
 none 	you do two iterations of that 
 none 	then you do two iterations of   of   of context  dependent phonetically tied mixtures 
 none 	and then from that you   you do the   you   you go to a state clustered model  and you do four iterations of that  so there s a lot of iterations overall between your original boot models and the final models  i don t think that  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	we have never seen big differences  once i thought  oh  i can  
 none 	now i have these much better models  i ll re generate my initial alignments  then i ll get much better models at the end  
 none 	made no difference whatsoever  it s  
 none 	right 
 none 	i think it s   eh  i  the boot models are recur 
 none 	well  mis  for making things better  yeah  but  this for making things worse  this it migh  th  the thought is   is   is possible   another possible partial cause is if the boot models used a comple  used a different feature set  that  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but there are no boot models  in fact 
 none 	you   you re not booting from initial models  you re booting from initial alignments 
 none 	which you got from a different feature set 
 none 	that s correct 
 none 	so  those features look at the data differently  actually 
 none 	yeah  but  
 none 	i mean  you know  they   they will find boundaries a little differently  though   you know  all th  all that sort of thing is actually slightly different 
 none 	i d expect it to be a minor effect  but  
 none 	but   but   but  what i m   what i m saying is  
 none 	so  we e  w  f  w 
 none 	for a long time we had used boot alignments that had been trained with a   with the same front end but with acoustic models that were  like  fifteen percent worse than what we use now 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and with a dict  different dictionary   with a considerably different dictionary  which was much less detailed and much less well suited 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and so  then we switched to new boot alignments  which   which now had the benefit of all these improvements that we ve made over two years in the system 
 none 	right 
 none 	and  the result in the end was no different 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  what i m saying is  the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not a big factor in the quality of the final models 
 none 	yeah  maybe not 
 none 	but it   it   i st  still see it as   i mean  there s   there s a history to this  too  but i   uh  i don t wanna go into  but   but i   i   i th  i think it could be the things that it   the data is being viewed in a certain way  uh  that a beginning is here rather than there and so forth  because the actual signal processing you re doing is slightly different 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	but  it s   it s   that s probably not it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	anyway  i   i   i should really reserve  uh  any conclusions until we ve done it on the large training set  um  and until we ve seen the results with the   with the v_t_l in training 
 none 	so 
 none 	yeah  at some point you also might wanna take the same thing and try it on  uh  some broadcast news data or something else that actually has   has some noisy   noisy components  so we can see if any conclusions we come to holds across different data 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	uh  
 none 	and  uh  with this  i have to leave 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	with this said 
 none 	so  is there something quick about absinthe that you    
 none 	uh  just what we were talking about before  which is that i ported a blass library to absinthe  and then got   got it working with fast forward  and got a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle  so  that s pretty good 
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh 
 none 	cool 
 none 	um  i m in the process of doing it for quicknet  but there s something going wrong and it s about half the speed that
 none 	i was estimating it should be  and i m not sure why 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but i ll keep working on it  but the   what it means is that it s likely that for net training and forward passes  we ll  
 none 	absinthe will be a good machine 
 none 	especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors 
 none 	a few more processors  how many are you shooting for 
 none 	there re five now  it can hold eight 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	yeah  we ll just go buy them  i guess  
 none 	and it s also five fifty megahertz and you can get a gigahertz 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so 
 none 	can you mix t  uh  processors of different speed 
 none 	i don t think so  i think we d have to do all  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	probably just throw away the old ones  and  
 none 	yep 
 none 	thank you for the box  and  
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	i ll just go buy their process 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	maybe we can stick them in another system  i dunno 
 none 	we d have to get a   almost certainly have to get a  uh  netfinity server 
 none 	i see 
 none 	they re pretty   pretty specialized 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 find_calendar_entry 	is   is  liz   coming back   do you know  or    
 none 	i don t know 
 none 	i dunno 
 none 	yeah  oh  you don t  o_k 
 none 	uh  i   i will 
 none 	alright 
 none 	i   i actually have to run this stuff 
 none 	alright 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	see you 
 none 	um 
 none 	alright  so  
 none 	uh  they re having tea out there  so i guess the other thing that we were gonna talk about is   is  uh  demo 
 find_calendar_entry 	and  um  so  these are the demos for the uh   july   uh   meeting  and  um  
 none 	july  what 
 none 	darpa  mee 
 none 	early july    late july  
 none 	oh  i think it s  july fifteenth   is that it 
 none 	sixteen to eighteen   i think 
 none 	yeah   sixteenth  eighteenth  
 none 	roughly 
 none 	yeah  so  we talked about getting something together for that  but maybe  uh   maybe we ll just put that off for now  given that  
 none 	but i think maybe we should have a   a sub meeting 
 none 	i think  uh  probably  uh 
 create_calendar_entry 	adam  and   and  uh   chuck  and  me  should talk about   should get together and talk about  that   sometime soon   
 none 	over a cappuccino  tomorrow  
 none 	yeah something like that  um  uh  you know  maybe   maybe we ll involve  dan ellis  at some   some level as well 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um 
 none 	o_k  the   the tea is   is going  so  uh  i suggest we do  uh   uh  a unison 
 none 	a unison digits 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	which is gonna be a little hard for a couple people because we have different digits forms 
 none 	gets our  
 none 	oops 
 none 	we have a  
 none 	i found a couple of old ones 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	oh 
 none 	well  that ll be interesting  so  uh  
 none 	have you done digits before 
 none 	no 
 none 	i haven t done it 
 none 	o_k  so  uh  the idea is just to read each line with a short pause between lines  not between  
 none 	alright 
 none 	and  uh  since we re in a hurry  we were just gonna read everyone all at once  so  if you sorta plug your ears and read  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so first read the transcript number  and then start reading the digits 
 none 	sure 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	one  two  three 
 none 	l_ one fifty 
 none 	transcript l_ one four nine 
 none 	transcript l_ dash one four seven

 none 	six 
 none 	o_k we re done 
 none 	and  
 none 	and we re going 
 none 	so the only status ite  well  first of all we h  haven t decided whether we re
 none 	meeting recorder data issues  or recognition this week 
 none 	i think we were recognition 
 find_email 	wha  what was on the list   th  the   i mean   i  sent  you   a couple things   although i don t remember them  
 add_agenda_item 	you only sent me one thing  which was  demo status   
 none 	right 
 none 	and asking which one we were on this week 
 none 	ah  that was the second thing  right  right 
 none 	so should we simply assert that this week we are recognition  and next week data issues  and    
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i think that s correct 
 none 	yeah  i think so  too  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  uh  
 none 	so  i think what we should probably do is any quick  small stuff we can do every week 
 none 	so   like morgan asked about the demo status  we can go ahead and talk about that a little bit 
 none 	and then do   then alternate in more depth 
 find_calendar_entry 	by the way   i ll   i   i  won t be here  next thursday    i ll be out of town  but  
 none 	o_k 
 find_calendar_entry 	actually   i  may not be here either   so i gotta double check the dates  but  anyway 
 none 	so  uh  demo status  first of all  i did a little thing for liz with the transcriber tool  that  um   first of all  it uses the forced alignments  so that the words appear  uh  in their own segments  rather than in long   in long chunks  she said that that   she thought that was a much better idea for the other stuff she s working on 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah  that s great 
 none 	um  
 none 	and that works fine except it s even slower to load  it s already pretty slow to load 
 none 	yeah  it s slow 
 none 	yeah  it s more segments  or     yeah 
 none 	is that because the transcripts get longer  the f  transcript file gets longer 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and the transcriber tool is just not very good n  at   at that 
 none 	but th  but that s   that s n  you didn t have to change the software for that yet  right  it s just formatting the right kind of  uh  x_m_l    
 none 	correct 
 none 	yeah  it s just writing conversion tools from the format that the aligner  
 none 	actually th  he did a
 none 	s_r_t file for it 
 none 	mm hmm  o_k 
 none 	and then just back into transcriber   transcriber format 
 none 	oh  good  that s very good  o_k 
 none 	yeah  so my   my decision was  for the first pass for this demo that
 none 	liz was talking about i decided that i would do  um  only enough to get it working  as opposed to any coding 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	and so the other thing i  sh  she wanted to display the stylized f_ zeroes  i think they re called 
 none 	is that right 
 none 	yeah  the linear fit 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  uh  
 none 	so what i did is i just took the file with those in it  converted it so that it looks like an audio file 
 none 	right 
 none 	and  so you s  it shows that instead of the wavefile 
 none 	and so that   that s working  and i think it actually looks pretty good 
 none 	cool 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  i d like someone who s more familiar with it to look at it because when i was looking at it  we seemed to have lots of stuff going on when no one s saying anything 
 none 	that s just background speech 
 none 	ah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so do you have to pad that out 
 none 	so 
 none 	uh  so that it looks like it s an eight kilohertz sampled thing  or    
 none 	no  i   the audio file you can specify any sampling rate 
 none 	and so i s  i specified   instead of  you know  sixteen thousand or eight thousand  i specified a hundred 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	um  and  the only problem with that is that there s a bug in
 none 	transcriber  that if the sample rate is too low  when it tries to compute the shape file  it fails 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	um  and crashes 
 none 	um  
 none 	but the solution to that is just  set the option so it doesn t compute the shape file  and it will work and the only problem with that is you can t  uh  zoom out on it  you can zoom in  but not out 
 search 	what s  a shape file   
 none 	the shape file is   if you think about a wavefile  sixteen thousand samples per second is way too many to display on the screen 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so what transcriber does  is it computes a   another thing to display based on the waveform  and it displays it at  
 none 	we re talking about   we re talking about that demo 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	tried that  and it died 
 none 	yeah  did it 
 none 	and it allows you to show m  many different resolutions  so there s a little user interface component that lets you sh  select the resolution 
 none 	great 
 none 	i see 
 none 	and if you don t compute the wavefile  you can t zoom out  you can t get a larger view of it  but you can zoom in 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	um  
 none 	and that s alright  because at   at a hundred samples that s already pretty far out 
 create_single_reminder 	and  uh   so i think it looks pretty good  but i ll  let liz look at it and see what she thinks   
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i   i got the wavefile but  
 none 	sorry  i got the wavefile  but i couldn t get the words yet  but the   the wavefile part looks   looks good 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	we should  
 none 	if you were having problems with the words  we should figure out why 
 none 	i   i ll have done   i m probably doing something wrong 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	sorry this microphone s moving around 
 none 	i can t put this over my ear 
 none 	it could   do you have to put it in your ear 
 none 	you c  you clip that part over your ear 
 none 	i can   i can do that but there s no orientation where the  
 none 	darn 
 none 	anyway  we ll all watch liz play with the mike 
 none 	i  does it really need to go in her ear  that   that bud  it doesn t have to go in her ear  right 
 none 	um  
 none 	uh  no  it doesn t have to  but that   that s   i find that s the only way to wear it 
 none 	oh  wow 
 none 	is that the bud s in the ear and that the link is over it 
 none 	this bud s for   no 
 none 	but  so  anyway  i think that looks pretty good  the only   the only other thing we might wanna do with that is be able to display more than one waveform 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and that actually shouldn t be too slow  uh  because it s much lower resolution than a full waveform 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the problem with it is just it does require coding 
 none 	yeah  it migh 
 send_email 	and so it would be much better to get  uh  dave gelbart to do that than me  because he s familiar with the code  and is more likely to be able to get it to work quickly 
 none 	it d be nice if we can do  like  a quick hack  just so we can play the audio file  too 
 none 	right 
 none 	um  with th  with the display  like  even if we   i think that even if we didn t display the waveform  it might be better to  rather  play the waveform than display it 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	i mean  like  if we were to choose   i don t know  if i were to choose between one or the other  i d rather have it played 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i understand what you mean 
 none 	and then displayed 
 none 	right 
 none 	ps 
 none 	but for the demo maybe it doesn t matter  i m not sure whether you wanna do the demo live anyway  or just screen shots of what we have 
 none 	i don t know 
 none 	the problem with doing it live is it takes so long to load  that  um  
 none 	so this   the   this   uh  the sluggishness of the loading is all due to the parsing of the x_m_l format  right 
 none 	um  w  i was talking to dave gelbart about that and apparently it s not actually the parsing of the x_m_l raw   that going from the x_m_l to an internal t  tree structure is pretty fast 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	but then it walks the tree to assemble its dat  internal data structures and that s slow 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	seems like you should be able to spawn that off into a background process  because not everything is displayed in that tree at once  right 
 none 	uh  no  but what it does is it actually assembles all the user interface components then 
 none 	but   d  y 
 none 	right 
 none 	and then displays all the user interface components 
 none 	u  i m   i m confused  uh  is   is this downloading something that happens once 
 none 	seems like you wanna ass 
 none 	yes 
 none 	and   and then when you d  display different things  it s fine 
 none 	no  whenever you load a new meeting or a new transcript  right 
 none 	so  in that case  
 none 	a new transcript 
 none 	yep 
 none 	well  a new meeting  a transcript  right  but   but   i  i  for   but for   for presentation in  uh  
 none 	or audio file 
 none 	well  actually the audio files are pretty fast  too 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh   i wouldn t be  
 none 	you just have to have the thing running before you open your laptop 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  the only problem with that is if anything goes wrong or if you wanna switch from one thing to another 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	go wrong 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i see  yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	i guess for the demo you can always play   just store the pieces that you re gonna display and play those as separate files  if we can t  you know  actually do it 
 none 	just make shorter files 
 none 	but it s   you know  it   it s   yeah 
 none 	that s true  we could just subset it 
 none 	that s a good idea  that s actually probably the right thing to do 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and just make it l 
 none 	yep 
 none 	you know  just take f  ten minutes instead of an hour and a half 
 none 	yeah  th  that s what i did for   for my talk 
 none 	oh  oh  you re downloading a whole meeting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  yeah that   
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  so that   that s actually the   definitely the way to do it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s a good idea 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and then still do it ahead of time  but then at least you re covered if   if  uh   if there s a problem 
 none 	yeah  if there are any problems 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  i mean  even five minutes is probably enough 
 none 	huh 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  what happened to   is it st  possible at all to display the words in their aligned locations 
 none 	that s what i did 
 none 	o_k  so  sorry  i missed   o_k  great  but it   o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you missed that part 
 none 	i couldn t get the words and the waveform at the same time for some reason  and there must be some  
 create_single_reminder 	i ll   i ll   work on it with don and see what i m doing wrong   
 create_single_reminder 	yeah  i mean  just ask   just come by my office  i can show you as well 
 none 	o_k  great  well  thanks a lot  that s really great 
 none 	right 
 none 	and for the information retrieval  uh  don has been working on that  so 
 none 	yeah  so  it s coming along  um
 none 	it looks like it 
 none 	just hacking dan s code and m  stepping through it  but  i think it s close 
 none 	great 
 none 	and we should be there pretty soon  with at least  like   at least with  you know  being able to search over c  certain amount of meetings  just  like  really basic stuff  just asking fo  looking for a word  and looking through a bunch of different meetings 
 none 	and if we have time  i ll also add  you know  like  choosing which speakers you wanna include  and stuff  but  
 none 	o_k  well  i m gonna start working on this the week after next  so that s the point when i ll need to look more carefully at what y  what   what you guys have 
 none 	so  is the end of the month still the   the d   
 none 	right  the week after   th  th 
 none 	the monday the week after next is july second  which is the first day i get back  so
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  so i think for the l  stuff liz was talking about  we have something that ll work now 
 none 	and liz can look at it and see if she wants anything else 
 none 	maybe we can work on doing   displaying multiple   or displaying one and playing back the other 
 none 	so do you think it s reasonable to display more than one before the demo  cuz  
 none 	um  i think i d h  i d have to ask dave  i did it once before and it was just so slow to scroll  that i gave up 
 none 	huh 
 none 	but  the advantage is that these things are much lower sampling rate  and so then it might be alright 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k  let me know 
 find_calendar_entry 	morgan   when s  the demo   
 none 	well  uh  i m giving a talk on july sixteenth  it s a mon  monday in four weeks 
 none 	so  
 none 	three weeks 
 none 	if   if raw speed is the problem this thing is written in tcl  right 
 none 	tcl 
 none 	y  i mean  john osterhout  uh  
 none 	y  you know  he started his own company based on tcl stuff  and maybe they have the native code compiler or something 
 none 	i mean  we could check  i don t think they do 
 none 	um  there was actually a java back end that apparently is actually a little faster 
 none 	it generates byte code 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	but  uh  
 none 	it s always exciting to hear that java s faster than something 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  e  everything is faster than tcl t_k  it s a string substitution language  basically 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i should probably beep that out in case john osterhout ever listens  but  
 none 	but tcl is wonderful 
 none 	well  it is wonderful 
 none 	it is  for prototyping and user interface  it s just really   the language is awful 
 none 	there you go 
 none 	oh 
 none 	beep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	beep  y  right 
 none 	but let me tell you how i really feel 
 none 	we re all entitled to our opinions here 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  i like it  it s great 
 none 	um  yeah  so it s   yeah  i think it must be three and a half weeks  uh  cuz july  
 find_calendar_entry 	the   the  meeting  is  july sixteenth  through  eighteenth   
 none 	and  uh  my talk s the first day  so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i m flying out there the sunday before  so 
 none 	um  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i guess  you know  it d be desirable if  a week ahead of that  we basically had   thought we had it  which would allow a week for re iterating 
 none 	for realizing we don t 
 none 	oh  that s right 
 none 	yeah  pretty much  yeah 
 none 	then the other issue related to that is data release  if we wanna show this in public  it should be releas  so  i  uh  haven t gotten any other replies from the original email asking for approval  so i sent out another set this morning 
 none 	i th  i saw that 
 none 	and  uh  we ll see if we get any responses 
 none 	i just did it  but it is   i did wanna say that  um  
 none 	very good 
 none 	did you notice i put in the filter 
 none 	no 
 none 	no  no  i just figured you p 
 none 	go ahead 
 none 	there s a link there that now says if you want to search by   filter by a regular expression  you can 
 none 	oh  my gosh 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i put that in just for you 
 none 	terrific 
 find_email 	well  since you didn t answer the emai  so there was a q  question  i  had asked  adam  whether  it s possible to search only for your own name   your own utterances  so that you know you don t have to go through the whole meeting  and  
 none 	um  and i didn t hear back  so i thought  o_k  it s probably too hard  he s overloaded  i won t say anything  i ll just do it  
 none 	great 
 none 	o_k  so  anyway i looked at everybody else s stu 
 none 	it s actually an arbitrary   arbitrary regular expression  but if you search your name  you ll get all of the things you said and any time anyone said your name  so 
 none 	good 
 none 	so th 
 none 	that s great 
 none 	and it s   it s case insensitive  yeah 
 none 	correct 
 none 	that s great 
 none 	did you actually look through your transcripts  or   you just approved them all 
 none 	uh well
 none 	i just approved all mine  i didn t look at them 
 none 	i sort of spot checked  i was trying to remember  
 none 	oh  darn  i haven t done that yet  er   o_k 
 none 	i couldn t find the   the keywords for things that i thought i had said wrong  so 
 none 	it s hard to find 
 none 	that makes it g 
 none 	that s a compliment to you 
 none 	he said it s hard to find things you say wrong 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	it s hard to find anything that you say in these 
 none 	yep 
 none 	great  well  thanks for the filter  uh  it s really useful  tha  cuz if you re only at part of a meeting  or something
 none 	you really do have to sort of r 
 none 	so  we have our first information retrieval example  it s a regular expression searcher 
 none 	yeah  that s right 
 none 	yeah  that s actually   well  it s useful 
 none 	and it demonstrates why it doesn t work  because you really wanna go acro  more than one meeting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and you need a better user interface for displaying the results  so 
 none 	but this helps a lot 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you wanna say   where are al  where   find all the contentious things i said  
 none 	great  thanks 
 none 	yeah  really 
 none 	find everything that should be bleeped 
 none 	that s right  th  we do have that bi  nice marker   is that  n  n  because we all know we re being recorded  whenever anyone says anything like that  we then have a conversation about bleeping it out  so 
 none 	right 
 none 	we 
 none 	yeah  you can search for  beep  or  bleep  
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	in somebody else s turn 
 none 	um  oh  and also we actually have a few people who have still not filled out speaker forms 
 none 	specifically in the n_s_a ones  and i noticed that when i tried to  uh   uh  generate the transcripts for n_s_a  that there are a few with no speaker forms 
 none 	and so  uh  i have a  
 none 	i sent out yet another this morning  which i think makes six total emails that i ve sent to these people  and so i think we need to escalate to some other method of trying to contact them 
 none 	um
 none 	right 
 none 	stalk them  at their  
 find_email 	has   has   has  joachim sokol  replied   or    
 none 	like in the morning  when i leave for work 
 none 	nope 
 create_single_reminder 	i think  maybe  talk to him first in person    that s what i would think 
 none 	he s not around  is the only problem 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	oh  is that right  oh  i saw him   i saw him on tuesday 
 none 	yeah  otherwise  it d be a good idea 
 none 	yeah  he popped in  but  i mean  he s basically gone 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	cold calling at lunch time  uh  dinner time  i mean 
 none 	well  if i could find phone numbers  that would certainly work  but 
 create_single_reminder 	well  did  you   ask lila    cuz i bet she has this information 
 create_single_reminder 	yeah  that s a good idea    i ll   ask her if she can con  track some of them down   
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  and   and tell her   you know 
 create_single_reminder 	tell her your specific problem    she ll fix  
 none 	and it  
 none 	m 
 none 	and  uh  then there s still m  um  
 none 	miguel is still an active member of the group and he s   what i mean is  he s an active member and he s still here 
 none 	he s right there  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	very helpful 
 none 	yeah  i didn t actually see who they all were 
 none 	um  a couple of them were  like  people at i_b_m who were here for one of the i_b_m meetings and one   a guy from s_r_i who was at one of the s_r_i meetings 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and so  uh  those might be harder to track down 
 none 	most of them  though  really were visitors here and lila should have contacts with them 
 none 	yep 
 none 	nice meetings  by the way  yeah 
 none 	i mean  they   they were people who didn t have accounts at icsi  so they re   they re harder to find 
 none 	well  not the ones that  
 none 	are you su   
 none 	are you sure 
 none 	am i sure about what 
 none 	yeah  n_s_a  one and n_s_a  three  we re talking about those 
 none 	there were other people also 
 none 	there were other c  other people also who didn t ha  fill out the speaker forms  in addition to the n_s_as  yeah 
 none 	i  i  in   in other meetings  yeah 
 none 	oh  oh  i see  o_k  fine 
 none 	well  s_r_i people  easy to f  find 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  uh  i_b_m people  also  just let us know  i mean  
 none 	just   we certainly have their email 
 none 	but i knew everybody in the n_s_a meetings 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so th  i m sure that we have  uh  fresh  you know  information on them 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  none of the e  emails bounced  so i know they re going somewhere 
 none 	good  o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	that s all i have 
 none 	you wanna talk about recognition 
 none 	chuck  you wanna talk about recognition 
 none 	i haven t done anything  i was  
 none 	j  t  liz  you wanna talk about recognition  thilo  you wanna talk about recognition 
 none 	i was away for a couple of days  so 
 none 	i haven t done a  
 none 	we re sort of in a stage where we re   uh  don s going through getting some of the next meetings that jane s  has  and  uh  you know  creating a second database  so we haven t actually run anything yet  we need to get a critical mass for that 
 none 	however  i just got an email from thilo saying that we are ready to run  
 none 	i mean  we have segmentations for the old meetings that are from his segmenter  and so  
 none 	and check the segmentations  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	you   you had three different versions  with different  like  pause thresholds between the segments 
 none 	great 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  just   yeah  just smooth the   the output of the   of the detector 
 none 	right  and you recommended using the one with two s  maximum of two seconds  but two s 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	a   what do you mean  a different pause threshold  do you mean a    
 none 	yep 
 none 	or you can   yeah  you can use the one with one second or whatever  i   i   i   there s no   not much difference between the   the one second and the two second one 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i mean  the only advantage to using the longer threshold would be that you run less risk of missing some   some speech  right 
 none 	backchannel 
 none 	and i think   wouldn t it be better to   to have a little longer sequences for the recognizer  b  eh  because of the language model  as sometimes it happens that   that it cuts off within a s 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but two seconds is pretty long  so  
 none 	yeah  but  we can be sure that as   or we can be   er  not   not totally sure  but we can be somehow sure that there is nothing   not   no speech between those  so  it   it  
 none 	no  it s not bad  that s good 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i  ye  yeah  th  u 
 none 	hmm 
 search 	what does  the two second threshold  mean  
 none 	i think i  it doesn t   it s the same as in the   the smoother for the  
 none 	i th  i think that s g  that s good 
 none 	i_b_m thing 
 none 	it combines them if it s   if the pause is longer than  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s   it s no more than six words  so   roughly  on average  that s pretty good  i think  it s better than a  
 none 	ah 
 none 	so  yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so 
 none 	right  so the   the trade off is you get longer utterances  but you miss fewer utterances 
 none 	but  
 none 	yeah  but   but the   the chunks are already sh  i  in general  are short  so i   i t  i think it would be better to have   to have more of them concatenated together  in order to have better language model or language modeling 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	i think two seconds   mmm
 none 	i don t know 
 none 	i would maybe go with one second  i don t know  it s a  
 none 	well  take a look  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	do that  yeah 
 none 	see what the length distribution is  yeah 
 none 	yeah  but   but y  there s   there s really not much difference between the one second and the two second  so just take the one   the one second one 
 none 	really 
 none 	i wouldn t think that the language model would continue across two seconds 
 none 	uh   bu  i m   i m   i m just scared that with two seconds you get   you get  um   you   you get false recognitions  you re gonna  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  yeah  y  you do  becau 
 none 	yeah  you re gonna hurt yourself occasionally by having   missing the language model context  but you might hurt yourself more by having misrecognitions due to background speech  or  uh  y  noise  or whatever 
 none 	i   i m not too afraid ab  about that as w  when there   when there would be something   some background speech or something   there wo  there would be a   a chunk in another channel  and when there is s  something in between  i con  i   i do not concatenate them  it s just when there is   when they are sequentially and  
 none 	oh  i see  then   oh  i see  o_k 
 none 	yeah  i think it s better 
 none 	oh  right  oh  that s  
 none 	the longer is better  there s   there s   th 
 none 	mm hmm  o_k  sure 
 none 	so  i wou  i would use th 
 none 	beca 
 none 	we can try them all and see which works better 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	there s a l  there s a lot of these cases just like now  where i c  people say  uh   uh  when they re trying to ta  and there s about a half second pause to a second in between and then another word  and it s much better if we can keep those together  i think 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  it s  uh  funny looking at some of the transcripts  i was filtering by person  and in one of the   one of the early meetings  one pers  particular person  almost the only thing they said the entire meeting was  yeah    uh huh   it was just a whole list of them 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i bet i know who that was  yeah 
 none 	o_k  so   so we need to split the waveforms  then  or do you already have them split up  no  you don t  right 
 none 	it was very funny 
 none 	no 
 none 	so   so  i guess don would need your help to   to create a new set of split  uh  meetings 
 none 	sure 
 none 	you know  you just fake the format that you take as input with the synch times to a new set of synch times  and  
 none 	if  
 none 	we could  
 none 	right 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	uh  do we know about disk 
 none 	but th  oh  yeah  there s that pressure 
 none 	uh  abbott disk 
 none 	uh  i know they re in 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and  uh   but i don t know  i think he was   wasn t he asking about    
 none 	wel 
 none 	he had a problem  right 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yep 
 none 	oh 
 none 	well  there was an issue  he wanted to take it down  and then he tried  
 none 	h  he did  and then it didn t work  and
 none 	couldn t format them  no 
 none 	i didn t hear anything after that 
 none 	the only reason i m asking is  you re gonna need space to split them up  and so i wanted to make sure we had some available for you 
 none 	i still have  like  probably six  seven  eight gig on my disk 
 none 	o_k  so we re o_k   we re still o_k for another couple days  then 
 none 	and i have   i have like another un backed   i ha  have another six gig  which jeremy  if you re not using  can   on x_a 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	wel 
 none 	so we re o_k for   for a couple weeks  then 
 none 	markham probably needs u 
 none 	h  he probably needs us to approve another time to take things down  right  in order to do that 
 none 	to you 
 none 	yeah  he   he didn t say   he hasn t said anything to me about it 
 none 	i thought he   i thought he said in that mail that he would need to take it down another time  so i think he  
 none 	yeah  i think  
 none 	y  yeah  he just didn t say when  so  
 none 	yeah  he  
 none 	well  no  i think he wanted u  us to tell him when 
 none 	how about during the picnic 
 none 	ah 
 none 	yeah  i m sure he d love to  
 none 	yeah  i m sure he d appreciate that 
 none 	sorry 
 none 	well  m  my feeling about that is p  is p 
 none 	fortunately  markham s not a transcriber  but  um  
 none 	beep 
 none 	well  o_k  that s the point 
 none 	so it s jane that we have to coordinate that through 
 none 	uh  what i was gonna say is  as soon as possible  and i m willing to not work for an hour to get it done 
 none 	uh  but  
 none 	 i might not work  
 none 	oops  i m sorry 
 none 	oops 
 none 	whoa 
 none 	 i m   i m willing to not work for an hour   i know you re willing to not work for an hour 
 none 	because when abbott s   yeah  right  because when abbott is down you can t work 
 none 	but  i th 
 none 	you re really dedicated  if you re   no matter how you parse that one 
 none 	yea 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but  uh  i think the per  the people it disrupts the most are the transcribers 
 none 	well  you know  uh  i   all i need to do is mail  um   send them m  a mail like two days in advance so they can schedule their time 
 none 	i did that with the last outage  i j  i wrote to them letting them know that this w  was not  um
 none 	o_k 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i 
 none 	so  o_k  it sounds like markham should almost decide when he wants to do it  and tell us  as long as  
 none 	so early next week 
 none 	and just as long as we have a little warning 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so that means we can t  um  save meeting data either  right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  just not during that time when it s down  but that   it should be down for an hour 
 none 	so it just can t   so we can t have two meetings in a row where the first meeting s during that hour  that s all i meant 
 none 	right 
 none 	well  no  we can store them here 
 none 	that   that s happening  like  today 
 none 	we can store them here 
 none 	you   we just run the risk that if you have a crash we lose the data  so 
 none 	temporarily 
 none 	they re stored on popcorn 
 none 	well  no  i mea  i mean  the fir  oh  jus  o_k 
 none 	this is on popcorn  or    
 none 	yep 
 none 	this is on popcorn or something  yeah  o_k 
 none 	yep 
 none 	we store   we store our data on popcorn 
 none 	anything else 
 none 	that s really great 
 none 	i was just thinking we store our data on popcorn  how many   how many institutes can you say do that  o_k 
 none 	excuse me 
 none 	yep 
 none 	pop goes the data 
 none 	uh  g  megabytes and mega  many megabytes  too 
 none 	um  what   what  uh    
 none 	we have a kernel on popcorn  too 
 none 	right 
 none 	that s very good 
 none 	so uh  what   what s on your queue for   for recognition experiments  let s talk about that for a second  maybe 
 none 	u  un 
 none 	can i have butter on my meeting 
 none 	what was the question 
 none 	uh  
 none 	what   what was on his queue for recognition experiments 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um 
 none 	i m rebuilding the net that we re gonna use for the tandem stuff  and so what i m doing is  um  putting in the stream reader into the quicknet libraries for the s_r_i feature files 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	an  which is the right way to do it  i mean  when we did our first experiments and i was  uh  creating s_r_i feature files from the icsi front end  i just had perl scripts  you know  and hacked a bunch of stuff together just to get it going  but the r  the right way to do it is to integrate it in with the icsi tools  and so  that s what i m doing now  and so once i get that done  then i ll generate the p_files i need  cuz we already have the feature files in the s_r_i format  so what i need to do is  make it so that the   the quicknet stuff can read those  and  uh  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i  is that independent or related to also being able to write out the  uh  feature file i  in the s_r_i format f  r 
 none 	it s both  there s a   there s an input stream and an output stream 
 none 	input reader and an output stream  yeah 
 none 	oh  o_k  so then you could use  um  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you could use  um   uh  like feacalc and s  just specify as an output format the   the   oh  o_k 
 none 	yeah  that s the point 
 none 	th  t  i m just ignorant about the sof  software architecture of this thing 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  so  if   if you  
 none 	right  quicknet is a very nice stream based library  so without too much effort  once he has the classes written we can incorporate it into all the standard tools 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	oh  cool 
 none 	so 
 none 	great 
 none 	so  then it s t  uh  tandem experiments after that 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	and at some point  i d like to get back to  uh  porting quicknet to the multiprocessor linux box 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you know  i   i have forward passes working  but i haven t done training yet 
 none 	so  b  speaking of linux  so  
 none 	th  there s some i  impetus at  um 
 none 	s_r_i to actually u  u  p  th  uh  build   support linux as a platform  so 
 none 	what that means is  once we have  uh  everything running on linux we can also use a li  eh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	n  run all our jobs on your machines 
 none 	sorry 
 none 	yeah  exac 
 none 	we don t have too many  we just have that   just have a few linux machin 
 none 	i mean  if you can t use all the processors on whatever machine  we ll help you with that 
 none 	yeah  that s right 
 none 	well  that s the nice thing about it  is that   i  since it s coarse parallelism you don t have to do anything special 
 none 	right  exactly 
 none 	so  i mean that would be a fine use for b  for that machine 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so it s just  uh  
 none 	oh  i know what it was  
 none 	five more processors 
 none 	uh  yeah 
 none 	um  yeah  u  um  
 none 	some  
 none 	or if   uh  you know  in the future  if linux machines become like way cheaper  than  uh  you know  solaris machines  then you know  that wouldn t be a reason not to use linux anymore  so 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  i think it would be ne  neat at some point in this to do  um  a recognition  uh  pass on one of the p_z_m mikes for these s  same meetings that you ve been gi  n  gi  bi  i mean  it s gonna be terrible  but  you know  we   we just don t know how terrible 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	for the meeting 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	ye  it s also an interesting problem to come up with the reference 
 none 	and  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so  the reference file for the relative times at which   so  
 none 	oh  yeah  that s really hard 
 none 	well  i  it s an interesting question  because i was thinking  well you can force align the transcriber transcripts  and then of course  you try to merge them in time 
 none 	it s not determined 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but how do you score   
 none 	i think the first pass is throw out words which are overlapped 
 none 	i mean it s just an interesting problem 
 none 	that would be a good first pass 
 none 	just ignore everything that has any overlap 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	right  i mean  there s a whole sort of dis  right  we   right 
 none 	yeah  cuz you have a set of scores about that  so maybe then  that wouldn t be so bad 
 none 	but there s a whole interesting discussion  cuz of course the alignments are not perfect either  and so   um  in fact  we actually don t have a   a p 
 none 	oh 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but   that d be a hell of a lot better than what we do with just these  and   and   and  again  if you rule out the overlap  you have some numbers for that  cuz that s yet another  
 none 	i mean  it  it s worth trying  i  
 none 	right  right 
 none 	but  i   i m just concerned  of course  about that  
 none 	oh  i see  you mean when only one person is talki  yes  we could   we could try tha  right 
 none 	yep 
 none 	cuz you have scores for that for the other case  and  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right  exactly 
 none 	yeah  we   we should try  
 none 	we just don t know how bad it will be  i mean  one of the things that dave was noticing   we were talking this morning   is that i  it seems like   and we do  don t know this in detail  but it seems like you re getting a lot from the channel adaptation  the speaker adaptation  and so forth 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  so you are  already  in that recognizer  doing something that is likely to affect  uh  the   the far field microphone  uh  formant   so  it may not  
 none 	mmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	i mean  it s gonna be bad  but  uh  it may not be  like   won t decode  kind of bad  it might   might only be that it goes from forty percent to eighty  or something like that 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  eighty percent 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	do you assume you know the speaker when you do this 
 none 	i want us to assume the exac  whatever it was you assumed when you did the other   the   the close mike 
 none 	you just di  you just  
 none 	well  th  r  well  there  there s only one person who it can be  because they own that microphone  i m just wondering   there s  
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  that   that becomes another problem  actually 
 none 	well  and then you have the gender detection
 none 	no  it s not a pro 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  but for a  
 none 	right  and  
 none 	but  for s  for scoring  you can do it or not do it as you choose  so 
 none 	oh  i m  
 none 	r  right  but in terms of   for norm  for adaptation  right 
 none 	n  s 
 none 	but you re saying for this   for the adaptation  you mean 
 none 	so  d  s  so   fo  not   well  for everything  for   s  for   f  even feature normalization  for  uh  vocal tract length estimation  all of   all of these assume you know who s speaking  so  you would have to do a speaker segmentation first on the far field micropho  signal 
 none 	you know  do you do a supervised adaptation    
 none 	right 
 none 	ye  all of these adaptations ha  assume that the same person  
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	n  well  but you can use the   when you re doing the scoring   since you re   you re gonna be scoring against transcript  you can use  
 none 	you mean you wanna cheat 
 none 	well  you re doing that anyway 
 none 	ooo  i don t like that term  i don t like that term 
 none 	n  well  i was just aski 
 none 	no  if   i  i 
 none 	so ch  chea  try to cheat in the same way that you re doing with the close talking 
 none 	i don t like that term 
 none 	i  
 none 	actually  the s  those are two  
 none 	i have  
 none 	o_k  we g  we re gonna bleep that out 
 none 	i  
 none 	i have a suggestion  do the simplest thing first 
 none 	yeah  right 
 none 	because we re gonna want to know that anyway 
 none 	so  wait   the simplest thing is you cheat  saying  
 none 	in other words  if you d 
 none 	no  it s   no  it s even simpler thing than that  is just that you don t know 
 none 	you mean you do  you don t do all those normalizations 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  you m  y  totally unadapted  uh  right 
 none 	just do   or a free ri  yeah 
 none 	yeah  because you can get a number   uh  for that with the other as well  right  you can turn those things off  right 
 none 	um  actually   we don t have any models  um  you can  
 none 	yeah  i  i 
 none 	no  you can  
 none 	um  
 none 	you can use a speaker   eh   what about gender detection 
 none 	a  actually  it s that   it s   it s   we would have to retrain models that are not   that have none of that stuff  uh  in it  but actually we could  
 none 	we can just run it  assuming that it s all one speaker  basically  and see what happens 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  and then put it in correctly and see how much that helps  i mean  i was just thinking  do the one that s easiest first  because you wanna know how much that s helping you in these cases anyhow 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	actually  
 none 	but d  do you have gender dependent models 
 none 	actually  no  th  th 
 none 	sorry 
 none 	a  are the models gender dependent 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  they re all gender dependent  so we would have to at least do that 
 none 	yeah  yeah  so  you can r  no  you can run both  and you can s 
 none 	so
 none 	no  actually  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	no  actually  what   here s   here s what we would usually do u  under these circumstances 
 none 	and pick whichever s better 
 none 	we would actually   we would run some sort of segmentation 
 none 	thilo s is as good as any  probably 
 none 	um  and then we would do an unsupervised clustering of   of the segments  to   and   and put the similar ones into bins that would be sort of pseudo speakers  and then we would do our standard processing on these pseudo speakers 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and that turns out to work very well on broadcast news  spine   those types of tasks  where you don t have the speaker segmentation given to you 
 none 	s  does the clustering     do you give it sort of a target number of clusters  or is it     adapted in some way 
 none 	um  you can either do it by target number or by some measure of dissimilarity that you use as a threshold 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	that s what i m just thinking one of the big differences with broadcast news and these meetings is we have m  many fewer participants 
 none 	the other thing is that you actually have direction here  so  unlike these corpora that are recorded with other microphones  like   the right way to do this i guess  w  you know  in the future would be  well  in general  thilo s sitting there  and this p_z_m is gonna   you know  he s roughly in that location 
 none 	right 
 none 	speaker i_d  yeah 
 none 	well  there re different ways of thinking about it  i mean that   that would be true if w  you had a meeting situation with multiple mikes 
 none 	but if you only had your p_d_a sitting in front of you  
 none 	well  any case where the people are not all sitting at the same place and they re not moving around too much 
 none 	and you have more than one mike 
 none 	yeah  if you don t have one   more than one mike  you don t have a very good handle on location 
 none 	w  well  you have distance  and you have  
 none 	that s   it s not enough 
 none 	i mean  that  um  jane s   i  n  the pickup of adam on this mike is gonna be different than me  in terms of energy and so forth over the whole meeting 
 none 	oh  so just from clustering  you might be able to cluster it better because of that 
 none 	you might get some clustering from the speaker and some of it from the characteristics of the distance  and  
 none 	mmm 
 none 	from mike  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  say  if   if you had a   a cardioid mike or something sitting someplace  then   sitting there  then it would   its   its response to him would be about the same as the response to him  and so on 
 none 	and transfer functions 
 none 	right  exactly 
 none 	well  you can do  
 none 	well  i think there re lots of   lots of ways of doing it 
 none 	you can   you can   you can do certain normalizations like  you know  gain control  uh  before you do the clustering to rule out those   those types of things 
 none 	they re both picked up in the clustering  i guess 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	or to just do the clustering  knowing that you re capturing both  it s just that the kind of clustering we ve done before hasn t had that  uh  distance factor  or location factor in it in the same way  and so we re not really modeling it directly  if somebody does  we sh  maybe we add that because i think it would be a pretty big difference  when you listen  you can sort of tell where people are  not which s  you know  side  but  
 none 	i see 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah  that s an interesting  
 none 	it s a big difference  yeah 
 none 	o_k  that would be fun   fun to try 
 none 	well  humans are really good at that   transfer function through the head  and things like that  so you know  even if you only have one ear  you can still get   get good transfers  so
 none 	right  even with one microphone 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  so our   our clustering is not gonna be intelligent that way  it s just gonna pick up whatever energy difference  or whatever  is  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  
 none 	anyway  i   i d   it d be neat to have that  because you know we ve been at this for a little while and we don t have   have   any results yet with   with conversational speech at a distance 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  um  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	we should at least get a first one 
 none 	something  yeah 
 none 	o_k  hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  and the other thing   this would kind of be a hail mary  but   but  uh  
 none 	uh  dave does have this stuff that is helping on digits  and  you know  and so with   then it d be  you know  just throw that in and see 
 none 	oh  yeah  then we should  
 none 	yeah  so it d be cool to see if it helped 
 none 	well  first you have to filter the whole training set and retrain 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	that would be   ft  quick  since i think he did it in matlab 
 none 	uh  well  he can do it in something else  but  i mean   you know  it s  
 none 	hmm  interesting 
 none 	yep 
 none 	right 
 none 	can t you export c_ from matlab  or is that mathematica 
 none 	um  
 none 	actually  we re experimenting with phase stuff now  and   and  uh  thi  this  uh   first result he got  uh  was really great  it actually  uh   uh   didn t exactly eliminate the reverberation  but it completely got rid of the speech 
 none 	oh 
 none 	that would solve all of our problems  wouldn t it 
 none 	wow 
 none 	yeah  well  i was thinking that  so  it s  
 none 	well  so just take the inverse and you re fine 
 none 	that s  
 none 	you think i didn t s  tell him that 
 none 	no  i got pretty excited  because it completely got rid of the speech  so  i was thinking  well  so  you know  it could be useful for lots of things   so  we have to  
 none 	so that s a speech detector  that s great 
 none 	that s interesting 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	did it get rid of other stuff  too  though 
 none 	what 
 none 	did it get rid of other stuff besides the speech  o_k  wow  interesting 
 none 	yeah  just subtract that   subtract that from the original signal and you re set 
 none 	well  we have to sort of check that out  that s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  then you can do like an   you can estimate the   the noise estimates  right  yeah 
 none 	noise estimate  signal to noise  that s great 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	reminds me of when th  when herve and i were first playing with c  uh  context dependent things for nets  and   and at one point we took out the speech input  so we only had priors  and our performance went up 
 none 	no 
 none 	mmm yeah 
 none 	wow 
 none 	i guess that s why herve always talks about using the priors as one of the mixtures in   in his all ways combos 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	s  yeah 
 none 	well  of course it was a bug  but  i mean  it s   it s a   but it was pretty f  f  it was pretty funny anyway 
 none 	but still  
 none 	wow  interesting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so if you run   er  your recognizer with all probabilities equal  what do you get out 
 none 	probably garbage 
 none 	whatever the language model says 
 none 	i bet the pruning  
 none 	yep 
 none 	the pruning probably prunes everything out 
 none 	you get out switchboard  that s just the lang  the language model 
 none 	yeah  that s right 
 none 	so that s how it was generated 
 none 	ha 
 none 	yeah  so we have this new speaker adaptation 
 none 	um
 none 	a   b  oh  it s a s  sort of feature normalization t  uh  like f  speaker adaptation  which  uh  which i wr  which i wrote about in the last status report  which seems to be helping about a percent and a half on
 none 	hub five 
 none 	so  um  we haven t tried that yet on the meetings  uh  but hopefully it ll help there  too 
 none 	i wanna ask  um   so  you know that the data   i v  i have upgraded it considerably  so i ve probably made  
 none 	i probably corrected something like  well  s  it s really a substantial amount of things that i ve caught  changed   um  added to it 
 none 	including a lot of  uh  backchannels  so  when you re d  running things  if you run it on the old  
 none 	so  if you   if you   run it on the new version  then the numbers will be   um  and you compare it to the   to runs on the old version  then you re gonna end up with more of an improvement than would actually be the case 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	different 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well  we   we have a frozen   we do all our experiments with a frozen version of the transcripts as of  i don t know
 none 	as of february 
 none 	a  a  as of   no  a little   i don t know  when   when did we grab the transcripts 
 none 	so a l 
 none 	like the h_l_t paper 
 none 	the b  for the f    it was m  m  march  probably 
 none 	f  sorry 
 none 	the  
 none 	for these meetings 
 none 	we re talking about which   which version we re using for evaluating the recognition  which version of the transcripts 
 none 	right  they re somewhere in between
 none 	january and late march  or something like that 
 none 	yeah  something around there 
 none 	o_k  well  so long as you have the same baseline  then you ll be able to tell 
 none 	but they are channelized ones  though 
 none 	no  no  yeah  o  obviously  yeah 
 none 	n 
 none 	n 
 none 	they re meetings that are now channelized  but they were not from  
 none 	the   uh  the other thing is  
 none 	so long as i  so long as it s the same baseline you ll be able to tell  but   but i m just gonn  i m just saying that if you were to compare that with running that on the new data  that it would be an   a more optimistic outcome 
 none 	th  the   the  
 none 	hmm  and  
 none 	well  the   and the other thing is  it takes only a   a minute to rescore all the old outputs with   if you had new transcripts  then we j  we just re  rescore the old  
 none 	right  cuz you haven t done any training 
 none 	sorry 
 none 	right  cuz we re not doing it for training 
 none 	yeah  we haven t a  modified the recognizer at all  so  actually  um  at some point we should update and rescore everything with  you know  the corrected transcripts  just to h 
 none 	right  so it s really   it would be really easy to re do it 
 none 	w  we just   we save  
 none 	yeah  it d be interesting just to see i  how much it changes  i bet it wouldn t change a lot 
 none 	well  the   the  
 none 	right 
 none 	what are the nature of most of the changes 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we can take   we can have a pool 
 none 	sometimes the changes are  um  cases where the recognizer would get it wrong anyway  cuz it was some word that we didn t have in the vocabulary  or  
 none 	that s just what i was thinking 
 none 	so  i   i   the thing is  when  
 none 	but it does help to get the backchannels back in  and things like that 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  whenever the   right now  the s  the scoring is based on segments 
 none 	um  which is not great because  for instance  
 none 	so   so  the   the other way to do the scoring is using a   a nist format called
 none 	s_t_m  s  uh  segment time marked  where  
 none 	yep  i   we know about it 
 none 	so  um  i have to convert the  uh  transcripts into this format  and then the scoring program actually looks at the times  and  uh  you know  it   you can have a different segmentation in your recognizer output than in your references  and it will still do the right thing 
 none 	so  that s what we need to basically  uh  to   hmm 
 none 	tran 
 none 	transcriber will export s_t_m 
 none 	oh 
 none 	in case you care 
 none 	well  but then there s other changes  so  i mean  there s other  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	we   we strip away a lot of the mark up  uh  in the transcripts  which  you know  isn t relevant to the scoring of the speech recognition output  so
 none 	right 
 none 	would that    
 none 	doesn t that only change the scoring if a word has moved into a different segment  i mean  i don t think that s   har  i hardly ever see that  i think most of them are pretty good 
 none 	no  i mean if   suppo  i   i assume you also changed some boundaries  right 
 none 	mmm  i did 
 none 	so  if we want to use new transcripts with a different segmentation  then we can t use them in the current way we do scoring 
 none 	we have to   m  m  switch to this o 
 none 	oh  you mean you would need to re run the recognition 
 none 	no  we have to r 
 none 	there s a difference  
 none 	i mean  if you re ran the recognition  then you just run it   oh  i see  if you wanna use the old  
 none 	right  right 
 none 	you can actually never  though  really infer what you would get with a different  
 none 	that s true 
 none 	you know  it s   it s probably more fair to re run the whole th  re run that 
 none 	uh  in other words  it s not really a scoring script problem  it s  
 none 	no  but if you w  just want to see what  
 none 	like  suppose you fixed some typ  no  jane fixed some typos and you wanna see what effect does that have on the word error  then we can f  we c 
 none 	right  but   but  
 none 	y  yeah  yeah 
 none 	if the segments change  that won t work 
 none 	you   it ll sort of work  but it s not exactly what you would maybe get from recognition  you never know 
 none 	well  i mean  what happens if you break one segment into two 
 none 	suddenly the  don  they don t match at all and you can t line them up anymore 
 none 	no  but that s what the pr  well  that s what i m saying  you can line them up based on the times 
 none 	well  you c  you   you s 
 none 	you can  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so the scoring program with   if you give it an s_t_m reference file  it will actually compare the words based on their time marks  so therefore  you can  um  
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	does s_t_m do it per word  or por  per utterance 
 none 	it s per utterance  but it   it allows   as long as you hypothesize the word in the right segment in the reference  it gives you credit for that  so it does a   it does a word alignment  like you have to do for scoring  but it constrains the words to lie within the t  the time bins of the reference 
 none 	th  what i thought 
 none 	alright 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and then it does also some  
 none 	within the segment  yep 
 none 	i see 
 none 	and   fo  for you to get a credit for it  so 
 none 	that sounds great 
 none 	so   so  it s   it should be just a straightforward re formatting issue of the references  so 
 none 	yeah  i mean  t  y  i was thinking  th  the other day  that this is not just conversational speech  the fact that is has so much technological jargon in it  i  it makes it   u  considerably harder to  um   me  e  e  e  to transcribe and to   to double check and all those things  so 
 none 	i think you re gonna find a substantial gain in terms of the word ac  accuracy 
 none 	so long as those words are in your vocabulary 
 none 	well  it definitely helps with  um  forced alignment  too  because  you know  whe  when we know the   the   the true words and we re adding them to the vocabulary and training a language model and so forth for future meetings  especially the   like  the front end meetings or meetings with a lot of jargon in them  that is not represented in switchboard or
 none 	one percent 
 none 	callhome  then it   then it really helps  so
 none 	well  all of them are  all of our   all of our meetings have a lot of jargon in them  but we know what those words are 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  i don t know how you get them into the vocabulary  but it would seem   
 none 	now  i have to   i have to   i really need to  uh  raise a question about the term  cheating   o_k 
 none 	and the reason is  um  if i understand that 
 none 	 cheating  is a term which is used to apply for basically what all of linguistics   corpus linguistics does  and what   what my transcribers are doing and what i do  which is a methodology whereby you actually physically mark things in the data  like the transcription  like the words that are actually there 
 none 	all   al 
 none 	all we mean by that is that we re giving the recognizer more information than it would have if you were running it raw  over a meeting that no person has ever listened to or transcribed 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  i mean  that   that part is o_k  but i   but i do wonder sometimes if it might be possible to use a term that s a little bit less evaluative  like  um   hand marked  
 none 	uh  but cheating is   is   p  sure  but chea  but cheating is   is   is   pretty commonly used to mean this  it really is  
 none 	it s a   it s a technical term 
 none 	it   i guess it   it s been around for a long time  and it   it s sort of  um   because it s so strong a word  people don t take it that seriously  in   it s not negatively viewed  it just really means  
 none 	it is  yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i  i  i  i 
 none 	i  it s   i 
 none 	it s even more than that  i think it   it really gives a very strong perspective  that you know that what you were doing is not an un biased experiment 
 none 	if you don t say that  then people think  oh  they did that and they threw that  but that doesn t represent what would happen in the real world  
 none 	but if you say  we did a n  cheating experiment   which is really the standard way you d say it  it says you deliberately put in a piece of me  information that you would not have in the real world so that you can learn something 
 none 	just as part   as your process  so it s   i d  i don t know  i   i 
 none 	o_k  i guess what i m   i m thinking  is just in   if   uh  when these are presented in an inte  interdisciplinary context  it might be nice to add that explanation  cuz otherwise it sounds like a pejorative statement on an alternative methodology 
 none 	cuz it sounds like   it sort of devalues the   the  um  all   other approach  which is to   to put those distinctions in 
 none 	maybe  i   i ve heard this at i_c_s_l_p for years and years and years  though 
 none 	i mean  it s   it s pretty   pretty common  people say this 
 none 	if   i  well  you i  i  in a   to a broader audience you could call it a diagnostic experiment  rather than a cheating experiment 
 none 	actually  jane is right  like  in conversation analysis  i ve never heard people use this  because they re not using an automatic system  so  it really  
 none 	but they don t run experiments 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  i m j  well  you can do experiments  but the   it s cheating relative to what we call a system where we can completely control this black box  and it s not a very smart system  it   it only knows what we give it 
 none 	they can do experiments 
 none 	and if w  if it knows more than we would really give it when it runs  we call it cheating  but it s  
 none 	yeah  it s f  only used in a community that does some type of computational modeling  i think  it s really not used in any kind of community doing experiments on human perception  or  
 none 	yeah  in pattern recognition  or in  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	you know  so she certainly can define it 
 none 	yeah  it s machine   machine experiments  um  i mean  w  when   when the  uh  the neural net w  uh   wave hit in the mid eighties  and by the late eighties there were   uh  we were reviewing thousands of papers that were coming out in neural nets  it was really hot  everybody thought it would do everything 
 none 	um  and a really common error that people were making was  they were just reporting their  uh   uh  classification results on the data that they were training on 
 none 	and so i think it was   it was   it was very important for people then who were doing something diagnostic to say  hey  i know i m doing something that isn t kosher  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and to make it really clear that they knew it  so that was  i think  why   why it became a popular term 
 none 	yeah  it just seems like  you know  i  if it were  bootstrapping    or if it were   i mean  there are other ways to maybe get the point across 
 none 	but it isn t bootstrapping  uh  it s   it s really cheating 
 none 	it s us  it s using information you wouldn t normally have  so 
 none 	it s just ng  yeah  yeah 
 none 	hu  well  o_k 
 none 	but it s cheating in a way that s pril  it s   it s announcing to everybody  hey  i m cheating  by doing this  
 none 	it s saying   so it s all above the table  i m actually using this other thing 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	that s   that s   that s the reason 
 none 	o_k  alright 
 none 	bootstrapping would imply it was actually legitimate in some kind of way 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	well  i   i think  
 none 	but  
 none 	we re not de legitimizing the data  we re de legitimizing the experiment 
 none 	we re not saying that the data is cheating data  we re saying th  we are cheating by using this data 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	because normally you wouldn t have that data available 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	does seem to me that it   that it carries over some baggage with it  that  uh  i  that   i can understand it in context as you described it 
 none 	anyway 
 none 	but  it   it seems to me that   u  um  it does import some negative evaluation  that  um  would maybe not be good if   it has shock value  and to the wr  to the wrong audience  i think that that might be t  a negative shock 
 none 	it has some shock value 
 none 	which is part of why it s used 
 none 	yeah  i thi  i think to the wrong audience  i agree that  um  p  to the wrong audie  we should just explain what it   what it means here  and that it s a common term  and we re  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	it s like a disclaimer 
 none 	yeah  we started with hand marked data  or with  uh  t  you know  hand transcribed data  or  
 none 	shoot 
 none 	yeah  did you break the microphone 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	just the clip 
 none 	nnn  o_k  o_k  well  i feel better now  thank you very much 
 none 	now we have to l  delete that expletive 
 none 	hmm  the first time i heard that  i   i thought  you know  the same thing and i guess you ju  after a while it becomes almost a   it s a bu  bit of a   a humbling thing when somebody says that  if they get good results but we were cheating on this feature because we took it for granted even though we can t really assume that  then it s actually the opposite  it s  
 none 	thank you  andreas 
 none 	it s p  it   it really is part of the jargon 
 none 	but it s also is  
 none 	right 
 none 	the trouble is  that   you know  i understand it in that context  but it   but it is almost resentful  it s almost like  you know  resentful of the data  resentful of the  um  the hard work that s going into preparing the data is  
 none 	well  
 none 	no  no  it has   i don t think you re saying the data is cheating  i think you re saying
 none 	well  it s   it s  
 none 	that s what i was saying 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	 in my experiment  i cheated in this way   i mean  another is what liz was talking about  how in the switchboard tests   in all the switchboard tests we ve been g  doing  we ve been making the same er  uh  same   uh  uh  standard   using the same standard way of   of getting the data to test on 
 none 	which means that we weren t actually running it on   on  uh  on data that had   had no speech 
 none 	and  in a sense  that was cheating 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so i  so it   it s   it s a good wake up call if people  well  we have this performance but you have to keep in mind  we re doing   we re   we re not doing the whole real task in this way and this way and this way  but 
 none 	i ll convince you that   that it s still important for you to listen to what i have to say next because of this and this  
 none 	o_k  o_k 
 none 	and so it s just a way of putting it all out on the table  uh  as opposed to  
 none 	uh  and it s used for a lot of different types of data  so  segment  whether you have segmentation or not  is it male or female or not  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  do you know the signal to noise  like  that s another one i see all the time  where you assume it s known 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah  sure 
 none 	oh  interesting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and you say it s cheating because you don t actually compute it 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i didn t know that  huh 
 none 	in  
 none 	in the multi band experiments  in the first one  we really wanted to find out   what if you knew which band was really noisy  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	n  right 
 none 	i mean  suppose you just know that 
 none 	same cheating 
 none 	and then   then  even if you know that  can that help you  i mean  what can   what strategy can you do  to do well without that particular band in the spectrum 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and so that was important to know as a baseline 
 none 	and   and then  once you knew that  then s  you go  well  now how do i know that that s noisy  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and   and   and  uh   but  y  you know  i   i should also say that there s a lot of   it s not just the word  cheating   but there s lots of other things that we talk about  which  as soon as you go outside of your narrow little group  it gets very  very confusing to people 
 none 	oh  sure  terminology is always context dependent  no question about it 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and   i  i  i  i 
 none 	it s just that it seems like the   the point without the negative evaluation would be  
 none 	however  you know  if  i  i understand your point  that it   th  it has a long tradition in this field   i didn t realize  and is used   this is interesting what   what adam said about it being used also for a bunch of other  uh  dimensions 
 none 	uh
 none 	it s not even really negative 
 none 	well  the example i was thinking of  also  was this w  thing that   that herve and   and hynek and i made about  uh  increasing the error rate 
 none 	and  so we   we did a number of papers  and talks  and so forth about  uh   w  uh  i  the   the virtues of increasing the error rate 
 none 	oh 
 none 	o_k  and   i mean  and the whole point of it was  not that it was good to increase your error rate  but it was good to be willing to risk increasing your error rate by trying risky things  and trying   because there s this notion of a local minimum  that if you just have some system that s very complex  and you t  you   you turn some knobs to try to make it better and better  you ll never get out of this local minimum  you have to be willing to jump to something that s quite different  and the first time you jump to something quite different  or maybe the first ten times or a hundred times you do  it s gonna be much much worse  because you ve optimized the other system 
 none 	fine tune little bits 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	interesting 
 none 	so the effect   the immediate effect is gonna be to increase your error rate 
 none 	interesting 
 none 	and so it was   we had a couple papers like  towards increasing the error rate in speech  and   and so on 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	huh 
 none 	and we really did get feedback from a few people  some of whom were  you know  fairly senior  that   that  um 
 none 	 well  you know  you sh  you   you c  we re c  really concerned about you misleading people into thinking they should be increasing the error rate  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  uh  and we go   we thought  oh  come on    but 
 none 	did you read the paper 
 none 	but weren t you cheating in those experiments 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s   we weren t  that s why we increased the error rate 
 none 	interesting 
 none 	actually  i think of cheating as a way to do some work  where you can t address all of the computational tasks  like  if we wanna study  um  speaker habits  but we can t do speaker detection  but we wanna assume   let s say  we know this is jane and we know this is chuck  even though automatically to look at the habits  we would need to also first figure that out  but we can sort of cheat on that factor because it s somebody else s research  and then we just  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so it s   then we wanna make a proof of concept for  
 none 	what   what this   w 
 none 	right  what would this be like if   w  it were perfect  if this component were perfect 
 none 	if someone else  
 none 	right  eh   or   w  but we really can t work on that problem  we don t have time  we re not interested  or w  whatever  
 none 	yep 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and so you   you assume it s given because it s  um   you wanna go forward with your research  and assume that you have that information  so 
 none 	it s too hard  usually 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i guess if   i don t ever think of it as negative  more like  it s something we re not building 
 none 	it s not pejorative at all 
 none 	well  the term itself is  you know 
 none 	but  it s not pejorative towards the data  it s pejorative towards  
 none 	but   but it   and it s pejorative with respect to a certain purpose  i understand  i   i wanted to raise the issue 
 none 	it s pejorative to o  ourselves  right 
 none 	s  self  
 none 	to say  i am cheating in this experiment  is not saying that the data is bad  it s saying that my experiment is bad 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	anyway  it s colloquial  an  and   and  uh  it s   it s interesting to hear that   that someone coming from a different direction   it s  it sounds the way it sounds to you 
 none 	anyway 
 none 	but   but  uh  i   i d never heard that before 
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k  that s interesting  o_k  well  i wanted to raise the issue  and um 
 none 	so  so i  so  that s interesting 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i   i  uh   i appreciate the discussion 
 none 	i wanted to ask one other question which is a different matter  which is with respect to  um  this thing that you ve been r  working on for the recording monitoring script 
 none 	so  the idea   you had this script that you re working on  to be sure that the microphone values are in   are kept in    
 none 	oh  right 
 none 	i haven t gotten back to that recently  but
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i assume you re saying you want me to get back to it 
 none 	cuz  y  you know  
 none 	well  i was just wondering if   i  i 
 none 	because i   i am finding that  um  in double checking  i ve run across  u  um  one data set where the microphone was off early on  and then two other speakers   their microphones went off later 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and this is out of  like  seven speakers  so out of seven speakers  four microphones  
 none 	y  you know  basically  three   three microphones bak  basically flaked  which makes it hard for the data to be used for all possible purposes 
 none 	d 
 none 	do you think the battery ran out  or    
 none 	that s what i think  i think the two that flaked late  i think it was the battery 
 none 	but  you know  if the script could  um  you know  alert the recording person to that  
 none 	i mean  i don t know if there s a way to replace a battery  if it happens in the middle of a meeting  maybe that s hopeless anyway  but  
 none 	well  
 none 	well  you can  but you ll lose a lot of data  but  i mean  that doesn t really help because often the recording person isn t in the room 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  i see 
 none 	so  what are you gonna do  i mean it will   w  the person   if you re looking up at the board and i disable the screensaver  you will see that the mike is off  but that doesn t necessarily help 
 none 	o_k  then i guess that raises the question of  uh  whether we should screen the data before they get transcribed  because  although i think that the data are still useful in terms of providing content  and   and that  i know that having three out of seven microphones out of commission during some part of the meeting restricts the  uh  usefulness of the data for other purposes 
 none 	so
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i   i think that s a really good idea  because for all kinds of studies  we don t really enjoy meetings where some of the   where the signal s going off at times  it just makes it hard to study any kind of parameters  so  if there s a way to check the signal quality before transcribing it and you find any problem at all  it d be much better to go to another meeting  i think 
 none 	and maybe you don t wanna have it  
 none 	i actually think that thilo s   n  in a   in a   k  a   you know  when you do the pre segmenter and you   and you run across troubles   he   he runs across s  some of these that are  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  some of these things are captured by   yeah  um  by looking at   at the minimum and maximum and whatever you find in the channels  and  
 none 	so  we have some part of that 
 none 	i c 
 none 	it s just hard to tell between that and just someone not talking 
 none 	but  
 none 	yep  yep 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	so 
 none 	well  there  the   and the other aspect of it is  um  that  when the microphone is not well adjusted  then y  i  i  even if it s not a lapel mike  you can get lapel mike type behavior  cuz i m   i m expecting  for example  with this  that you re gonna end up  you know  picking up other peoples  signals 
 none 	right 
 none 	i ve already written some notes here  so i  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  right  uh  
 none 	yeah  i mean  it s just   you know   the microphone is intended for certain adjustments 
 none 	well  we should be getting new equipment in  so we don t have to use the earplug any more 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but it s my ear  i m sure it s something wrong with my head  but  
 none 	it s your hair  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	um  actually  is there a way  though  to use whatever you re using for background noise to check post hoc that a microphone was constantly on  i mean  
 none 	i mean  y  d  you   you can do sort of a check  but it will be very hard to tell the difference between that and  um  someone not talking 
 none 	uh  like this o 
 none 	just so it doesn t   when the microphone s dead  it doesn t put out zeros  or     mm hmm 
 none 	no 
 none 	what does it put out 
 none 	really 
 none 	johnson noise  yeah 
 none 	but then how are y  how are you detecting during a meeting 
 none 	little bit of noise 
 none 	i use a threshold 
 none 	if it s below a particular value  it   it flashes yellow  so as i   eh   but it s not perfect 
 none 	but is it better than nothing 
 none 	yeah  probably 
 none 	cuz it would really be  
 none 	i mean  this is the reason why i haven t gotten back to it  is cuz my first pass at it didn t really work because all the mikes have different noise levels  and so i have to do something a little more clever 
 none 	right 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	it s just the noise from the connections and the   everything 
 none 	but you could  
 none 	yep 
 none 	so  you could run that post hoc on a already recorded meeting  in the sense that  you know  not everyone   as you just said  you won t be there  and then if we find any problems  have the transcribers listen and   i really think it s better not to transcribe a meeting that s gonna have problems once you ve spent all this effort 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yep 
 none 	the only argument for doing so would be with reference to the content  content maps 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	uh   but mayb  maybe then it should be done in the old original way  w  instead of channelizing and having the  uh  uh  you know  elaborate coding of the backchannels 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah  you could still   eh
 none 	yeah  there s   eh   the s  the standard deviation of the signal gives you a good clue  i mean  if that is too low  then you can be pretty sure that it s  uh  empty 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  sometimes you   you capture that when you mix it together  and   yeah  yeah 
 none 	right  exactly 
 none 	and actually  an   an alternative to even doing that level of transcription would be to have a transcriber listen and   and m  you know  maybe just  
 none 	oh  i don t know if a transcr  uh  
 none 	well  someone who s associated with the meeting could have  like  a summary of points handled in the meeting  you know  maybe if we could pay one person who knows that subject matter to do an outline of the meeting s content 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	well  it s even   if y  if you could still transcribe the words based on the far field microphone or something  you could  uh  still use it for  say  language modeling  you know 
 none 	instead of losing the content altogether 
 none 	is there a    
 none 	far field  yeah 
 none 	i guess the troub  trouble in my mind is that it   that it s not a very neat corpus if you say
 none 	yeah 
 none 	 these data are available  but these are imperfect  because of the f  you know  the batteries flaked  
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i d mu  we re   i d much rather have  you know  meetings that have all the channels  even if we had to skip a meeting or something  just for all these other purposes  so 
 none 	well  we ll just   we ll   we ll just have to note those 
 none 	well  if   right 
 none 	you could put them at the back of the queue or something 
 none 	i guess there is no   there s   there s no shortage of meetings  so we can afford   we can a 
 none 	and we have so many 
 none 	well  i   i   i think we can t throw away that data  cuz otherwise we ll end up with very few meetings  but
 none 	yeah  right  but may  just  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	right  there   but there s a shortage of trans  transcription power 
 none 	we have such a backlog  i mean  to be able to get through the backlog of the   of the good meetings  it would be nice to not have energies diverted  that s fine 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	do we have a     i m sorry for interrupting  do we have an e_d_u meeting at four 
 none 	you know what  they can  their four o clock cancelled  and they re starting at four twenty  and i ll set up at four fifteen 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	oh  good question 
 none 	i don t think so 
 none 	o_k  great 
 none 	good 
 none 	hmm  hey  i bet there s tea 
 none 	yeah  but there s  
 none 	cuz otherwise i was gonna say we have to cancel 
 none 	there s tea  also  though  so  maybe we should   maybe we should do a  uh  simultaneous digits   digits read  in the interest of   of getting the snacks 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  so you ll have si 
 none 	a simultaneous digit  o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	hey  i ve never done one of those  no 
 none 	oh  you never have  oh  it s a treat 
 none 	you have to plug your ears or just prepare not to laugh 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k

 none 	o_k  another successful babble 
 none 	and  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and we re on 
 none 	time 
 none 	so  uh  
 none 	fourteen whatever 
 none 	so  topic number one is  we got the n_s_f a_t_r   i_t_r   excuse me  which was originally pretty big  but it s divided among many sites  and they  like  cut the budget by a th  by two thirds 
 none 	so they   they approved it for all the sites  but only gave us like sixty two percent of the money 
 none 	or  excuse me  cut it by sixty two percent 
 none 	thirty two  yeah  thirty  whatever 
 none 	so  uh  morgan is  uh  
 none 	and the other condition is that they have to get a budget out  like  immediately  or the  or they ll give the money to someone else  so morgan s working on that 
 none 	by next friday 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so  i mean  it s good news  it s not as good as it could have been but it was  uh  
 none 	it s more money 
 none 	the   the  i_t_rs  are  you know  a   a   long shot  and so it s   it s really nice that we got that 
 search 	what does  that  stand for  
 none 	information technology research  something like that 
 none 	something like that 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	alright 
 none 	it s  uh  
 none 	doesn t say much 
 none 	yeah  it s pretty vague  it s government run  i guess 
 none 	it s   it s um  it s some money that we can use  
 none 	uh  i mean  we re in conjunction with uh  s_r_i  washington  and  um  columbia 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and to do research on the meetings 
 none 	cool 
 none 	yeah  it was specifically on the meeting 
 none 	not great 
 none 	so  d  was that the one that was the meeting maps 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  good  i liked that one 
 none 	yeah 
 search 	what is meet   meeting maps   
 none 	mapping meetings  or    
 none 	well  the   the sort of general idea was  you can think about meetings at lots of different levels  all the way d  from all the way down to acoustics to all the way up to dialogue  discourse  topic 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and so this   this was  how do you map all that information onto that  a  onto the meeting domain 
 none 	it s like creating a m  a map of a meeting  in a sense 
 none 	so that the   the analogy was you have maps of different things at different resolutions 
 none 	and so  uh 
 none 	uh  o_k 
 none 	so this had a lot of different stuff in it 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	it actually doesn t have a whole lot of   m  speech stuff to it  it s  
 none 	yeah  sure 
 none 	it s mostly higher level 
 none 	yeah  that s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	higher level  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  nonetheless  i think if we  
 none 	it s a   it s a cool idea 
 none 	and if we can actually get it   get it going that would be neat 
 none 	so   and uh  this was the one also that was  uh 
 none 	was it with susan ervin tripp 
 none 	i don t remember 
 none 	it might have been  yeah  we had to get some  
 none 	with who 
 none 	she s a linguist on campus 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	anyway 
 none 	so  other topics i wanted to talk about are  um  the darpa demo which  i guess  since morgan isn t here we can t really talk about  i just wanted to make sure it was ready to go 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  but i guess  
 none 	i sent  
 none 	your stuff is all ready so it s just a question of  did morgan get around to testing it 
 find_email 	yeah  and  i  sent  you  an email with  the instructions   
 none 	yeah  i got it  with the instructions 
 none 	i don t know  so  morgan  
 find_calendar_entry 	i guess  morgan s  leaving on  saturday   
 none 	yep 
 none 	so until then 
 none 	i guess we might hear something  but  
 none 	yeah  so i guess we ge  we had better be on call for a little while 
 none 	yeah  exactly 
 search 	did he ever figure out  how to d  switch between applications  like he was wanting to do  
 none 	i don t know  i haven t spoken with him 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	he did 
 none 	oh  yeah 
 search 	switch between applications   
 none 	how is he gonna do it 
 none 	it s just alt tab 
 none 	alt tab 
 none 	like if you hold down alt and then tap tab  you just   the s  just   the task manager w  window comes up 
 none 	yeah  yeah  he   he  
 none 	yes  that s  
 none 	i   i think  
 none 	i think the problem was that  i was t  saying  hit alt tab  with the assumption that he knew what i meant 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but he didn t  so 
 none 	no  he said he tried that  but he didn t like it because it  uh   it took it out of the  um  presentation mode 
 none 	we 
 none 	well  
 none 	but it doesn t 
 none 	well  because if you just touch alt a  if you just hit it once  it ll go back to the previous application 
 none 	it doesn t 
 none 	and the previous application was the powerpoint demo  which was the display of like  you know  
 none 	oh 
 none 	and   and all i said was oh just cycle through with alt tab because that s the standard way of doing it in windows 
 none 	not the slide show 
 none 	yeah  he didn t  
 none 	but of course he doesn t use windows 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  he didn t know what i meant 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	oh  so what do you have to do  you have olt  alt tab and  
 none 	hold down at   hold down alt  and then tap tab several times and you ll cycle through all the open applications 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	ah  o_k  and then it won t  
 none 	and then you can come back to your full screen version of your presenta 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh 
 none 	and i told them  um  if he decides to use multiple examples for  um  the prosody demo  to open up separate transcribers 
 none 	just so you don t have to load up files   e  during the meeting 
 none 	that s a good idea 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s not a bad idea at all  so that  uh  
 none 	he s got the memory for it  so 
 none 	yeah  and since the files are short  it s just  
 none 	yeah  they re all really short 
 none 	i mean the tcl t_k overhead is pretty high  but it shouldn t matter 
 none 	no  i didn t have any problems   i m sorry 
 none 	how much memory does he have 
 none 	how much memory does he have 
 none 	i don t know  but it seemed   it didn t seem to be a problem at all  i would imagine you add sixty four to a hundred and twenty eight 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i think he had one twenty eight  eh  but  
 none 	yeah  either one will work  i think  i mean  it was  
 none 	it was faster than my p_c  so 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	wow 
 none 	yeah  it was fine  i think y 
 none 	yeah  i mean   i   i   i   we kinda walked through it a little bit on his p  on his laptop 
 none 	so  are we the only ones who are giving demo  or is  uh 
 none 	i could
 none 	washington gonna have a demo too  or    
 none 	i assume  but they re all doing communicator stuff 
 none 	oh 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and it s part of the talk itself  so it s really not a big part 
 none 	yeah  i see 
 none 	i mean  the talk s only twenty minutes 
 none 	it s just gonna be a couple of  
 none 	so  you know  all this time we spent on it s gonna be thirty seconds of screen time 
 none 	i know  right   uh huh 
 none 	oh  my gosh 
 none 	oh 
 none 	but it s a good tool to have 
 none 	yeah  i 
 none 	the   th  the m  the meeting i_ r stuff is actually  
 none 	actually  both of them 
 none 	you know  cuz we re gonna wanna be playing with the   uh   help  my brain   with the uh  prosody stuff anyway 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	prosody 
 none 	um  so  actually  at some point w  we should talk to users of that technology who are actually gonna be using it and see what they would like to see 
 none 	yeah  have you guys seen the display  have you guys seen either of the demos  they re pretty cool  like   the prosody demo  we basically w  loaded up um  word alignments  so  instead of having um  utterances in the bottom  it s like just word by word 
 none 	no 
 none 	nope 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so you can see exactly where the overlaps are 
 none 	and then  um  adam did something where  um  we converted these feature files into wave files  so you can display them 
 none 	oh 
 none 	display the features 
 none 	instead of the wave file 
 none 	yeah  instead of the wave file  and then w  using multi wave you can add a file and play that sound 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	play the audio corresponding to that  um  um  feature file  and it s all like  aligned and stuff 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	ah  great 
 none 	so you see  like  the f_zero contour 
 none 	yeah  so you see the pitch contours and you   and when you hit play  like there s a line that goes through it  you know  and it s all aligned with like the t  the audio and the   feature file 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	oh  that s great 
 none 	audio 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and the stylized f_naught features are pretty cool 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so  these   this  it s  does a piece wise linear and so  normally if you look at an f_naught track  it jumps all over the place 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	this is a nice smooth one and it really does a good job 
 none 	and   there s something like a median filter in it  or something  and uh  and it s   it s a linear fit or whatever  yeah 
 none 	oh  neat 
 none 	it s a combination 
 none 	yeah  there s a  
 none 	yeah 
 search 	there s a  median filtering  and then there s a  piece wise linear fit   based on some criteria   i m not sure 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh  t 
 send_email 	g  actually could  you  email me  a reference to that paper    if you have it  cuz i m sorta curious how   what criteria it has 
 none 	yeah  sure 
 none 	i should email morgan about it too  because he was asking about that 
 none 	and  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  so  there s obviously a trade off between the number of knots y  you pick  and the best fit  i mean  so  if you re doing a piece wise linear  you have to figure out how many pieces you want 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  sure 
 none 	and so there s a trade off because the best   the best mean squared fit would be with an infinite number of knots 
 none 	right  well  then it s not a linear f  fit  you re not fitting anything then 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	well  sure it is  but
 none 	well  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  it  
 none 	so   so you   there s a trade off and i m wondering what criteria they use 
 none 	it s kind of a useless one 
 none 	yeah  i actually don t know off the top of my head 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	was this code that you downloaded to do this  or was it  
 none 	this was um  kemal sonmez at s_r_i  who s a co worker with  uh  liz 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	dot com 
 none 	at s_r_i dot com 
 none 	yeah  did i just  
 none 	no  i   you said  at s_r_i  so i had to add the  dot com  
 none 	no  i 
 none 	it sounded like a u_r_l  the way you were saying it  yeah 
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh 
 none 	sorry 
 none 	um  yeah  but  so kamal has  uh  
 none 	he did a paper on this for some v  speech verification  uh  project  and we basically e  extrapolated what he   what he did for that work and applied it to our files 
 none 	and that s how we do  
 none 	that s how we get our feature files and everything for all the prosody 
 none 	so what i mean is  like   the implementation that you used was something that you coded up here  or you grabbed code from somewhere else 
 none 	that  
 none 	no  we grabbed most of it  like  we grabbed the linear fitting stuff  we did all the alignments and all the matching and stuff  but the actual coding of the   the math was done somewhere else 
 none 	ah 
 none 	i see 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  
 none 	and the 
 none 	these are our f_zero candidates which i m supposed to use for the synthesis thing 
 none 	i suppose 
 none 	uh  so that s what you were working on  right 
 none 	right  that s the same software i used to get the data 
 none 	yeah  o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i   i gave you a c  couple examples  and  
 none 	yeah  i m  didn t have time to   to look at that  so 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	right  right 
 none 	yeah 
 find_email 	so  other topic is  uh  the i_b_m transcription status stuff  so we ve sent a few to them  we ve gotten a few back 
 none 	um 
 none 	i sorta wish jane was   were here because i think she gave  
 none 	didn t she give one of them to one of the transcribers 
 none 	yeah  it s done now 
 none 	and  how was it 
 none 	she said it was much faster  it really helped a lot to have that 
 none 	great 
 none 	so  um  you know  there were a l 
 none 	much faster than doing everything alone  o_k 
 none 	hand 
 none 	from scratch 
 none 	yeah  so  
 none 	from end to en  like  from the beginning of the process to the end of the process 
 none 	no  f  no  so from the point where we s  take it  it s faster 
 none 	well  but that s what we wanted 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	ooo  yeah 
 none 	right  we knew it would be longer to have multiple groups 
 none 	u  so it s sorta like doing things in parallel  you know  so if  you know  if they can be working on that while we re working on the other things  then when we get them in  they don t have to do that one from scratch  basically 
 none 	yeah  right 
 none 	right 
 none 	well  pipelined 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	the idea is that we re taking less time of the linguists  of the transcribers  so 
 none 	right 
 none 	s 
 none 	yeah  th  right now it is taking a bit of time to turn around the meetings from i_b_m  part  there s   there s several problems  one is  um  we were giving them these large files  which they then had to split up and put onto cassette tapes 
 none 	fff 
 none 	so either ninety minute or sixty minute tapes  so they had to try to find an appropriate place to break this large file that we gave them 
 none 	oh  well
 none 	so one of the things that we did is  adam made a modification to th  his script that generates this so you can tell it that you want  uh  basically  uh  chunks that are no more than either thirty or forty five minutes 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and then we can give those to i_b_m and it ll make it easier for them to put them on tape 
 none 	um  then the other thing is that these   pool of transcribers that they re using  um  sort of are not dedicated to   to our project  but are in use for all i_b_m projects  and i_b_m has recently giving   given them uh  a whole bunch of stuff  so it s gonna  sort of delay us 
 none 	we might wanna revisit hiring our own external transcription company 
 none 	because i think that would be cheaper than having our people do it  but do it with the same process with these beep files 
 none 	hmm  that s an interesting idea 
 none 	i mean  cuz  originally i had disc  discounted that because it was just gonna be too hard  but now we have this procedure with the beep files worked out 
 none 	yeah  so the only difference would be  we would be putting the stuff on tape versus i_b_m  
 none 	then maybe it would be o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and then we could send   if   if we had that process down  of putting the audio onto tape  we can send i_b_m the tapes or we can send this transcription place the tape 
 none 	and we might wanna do that anyway  because it seems like that s being a bottleneck and that s silly  it shouldn t be a bottleneck 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  
 none 	it would   once we got it set up it w  it  
 none 	well  u  u 
 none 	so  i don t know where the bottleneck was  was the bottleneck in breaking this large file up into the appropriate size chunks  or was it actually putting it onto the tape 
 none 	it may well have been partially that  you know  because they tried it  and then they would have to listen to the tape and find out where it bleeps  and go forward in the file  et cetera  et cetera  but  uh  it just seems like   it s not hard for us to do  and that would just make things go faster 
 none 	exactly 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  so how do we do that  how would we put  
 none 	get a tape deck  plug it in to the computer  hit record  on the tape deck  and just do it all   all uh  analog 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	plug it into the sound card 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so plug i  so  like  the headphone output in the back of the computer 
 none 	well  line out 
 none 	line out  yeah 
 none 	line out into the line in on a tape player  and  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yep 
 none 	oh  well  that sounds pretty easy 
 none 	so   i mean  that s the easy way  they might have a more complex set up at i_b_m  i ve seen digital   digital analog tapes where it s controlled by the computer 
 none 	yeah  but  
 none 	mmm 
 none 	the easy way is   yeah  i know  no  yeah 
 none 	but w 
 none 	but we don t need to do that  the   the disadvantage of doing it this way is it s real time  so you would have to sit there for an hour while it s recording 
 none 	yeah  but if it was at your desk or something  
 none 	but  
 none 	yeah  but you   yeah  pfff  yeah 
 none 	right  it s not a big deal 
 none 	so  what s the turn around period right now from i_b_m 
 none 	well  they   there was   o_k  so th 
 none 	should we be discussing this  uh
 none 	they  um  they gave   they ve given us  
 none 	since we started doing this new  uh  beep format with  beep number beep   they ve given us  uh  i think  two full  uh  transcripts  they have a third one and brian just sent me a note saying  oh  that third one somehow slipped through the cracks of their tr  of the eh   transcriptionists   uh  s  company  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	and so there s gonna be delay of a week before we get that third one back  and i ve already given him three more to work on  but he said those new three won t get done until this big chunk of data has been processed by the company 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and the transcribers here are still  uh   are working  though 
 none 	yeah  yeah  they re working away 
 none 	th  they re just doing their own thing  like  while they re waiting  o_k 
 none 	they re just doing   right  right  so what we do is  uh  when i go to um  select meetings for i_b_m  i go into the um   well  into the   the  uh  master sheet here with the statuses and i pick ones that thilo has  um  pre segmented  and i change the status to  trans _i_p i_b_m   so that  you know  when jane or whoever goes to select the next meeting they won t choose one of those 
 none 	master 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  um  
 none 	so i m not picking huge chunks  right now  of meetings for them  but  
 none 	so  
 none 	we should at least ask  um 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	brian if there are any particular requirements for putting things on tape  is there a particular type of tape that they want to use or anything else like that 
 none 	mm hmm  that s a good idea 
 none 	and  uh  
 none 	and then we should see how much of a pain it is for one of us  i mean the o  the other problem is you would wanna r  do it on an unloaded machine 
 none 	right  because you wouldn t want it to start stuttering 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	huh 
 none 	and that means   that   that s more of a problem because y  then you have to be there 
 none 	and all  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and all of the p_cs are connected to the network  too  here  or  uh  bad  
 none 	what i 
 none 	right 
 none 	you re just talking about playing it   and   recording it  like  real time 
 none 	yep 
 none 	oh 
 none 	so when that thing   when it stutters like that  is it because there s a delay getting the data off a disk  or is it because there s a delay in the d_ to a_ 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	it could be either  i mean  there are lots of different places  it can be delay on the disk  or it can be just load gets high on the machine 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  either i_o load or processor load 
 none 	i see 
 none 	you know  it s a problem with these multi user systems is that lots of processes are running and you don t t  really have control 
 none 	maybe we could do it from a w  a p_c or something 
 none 	wha 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but they are also on the networks  so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	if you used a line out  too  you have to worry about if you click around and you hit a beep or something 
 none 	maybe 
 none 	that s true  it ll   that s right  so you really do wanna be using a machine that s not  
 none 	it ll beep onto   onto the tape too 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	and you have to record every channel separately 
 none 	no  because we re doing the beep files 
 none 	well  you know  i   i think david might have a bunch of o  old p_cs  cuz he s replacing them with these new ones  maybe we could get one  and just dedicate it to doing this  not even hook it u  well 
 none 	the beep files 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	i guess we need to hook it to the network so we can get the files to it  but
 none 	we  
 none 	yep 
 none 	uh 
 none 	or you could just   you could have it   no active connection  just s_c_p them 
 none 	yeah  right 
 none 	and then just use that machine to hook up to the tape 
 none 	actually  it wouldn t be bad to have that  plus put on that machine a c_d burner 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we don t need a powerful machine to do these things  right  so  one of these old
 none 	no 
 none 	pentiums that we have  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	should talk to him about that 
 none 	or even a d_v_d burner 
 none 	a d_v_d burner  yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i guess the real question is  where would we put it and who would do it  i guess whoever records the meeting 
 none 	i mean  it  it s not a big deal  but it s yet another thing you have to do 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	that s why i wanted to avoid having to do that if we could  but  
 none 	it s just another  
 none 	they couldn t use c_ds 
 none 	no  because the transcription company does what they do 
 none 	they have a um   a device that  you put the cassette in and it has a foot pedal that lets you go back and forth and stuff like that  so 
 none 	oh  i see 
 none 	i see 
 none 	i guess they haven t got a p 
 none 	actually there are a few   i saw a web based one at one point 
 none 	web based 
 none 	where you could send them audio files over the web and they send you back text files over the web  i should look that up again 
 none 	really 
 none 	y  can you send them huge audio files 
 none 	mmm  mmm 
 none 	you can  but they never will be able to read them 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i assume that you can send them anything that they can access with h_t_t_p 
 none 	huh 
 none 	that s interesting 
 none 	well  they must be dealing with large amounts of data if they re transcribing  anyway 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  
 none 	well  that s true 
 none 	people probably aren t sending them  you know   an utterance or two 
 none 	are   how big are these files that we send to brian 
 none 	uh   pfff 
 none 	half a gig 
 none 	really  that big 
 none 	oh  no  wait  they re the beep files  yeah  it s a p  hundred meg  they re the beep files  that s right  so they re smaller 
 none 	i thought it was  like  a hundred megs 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	that s still pretty dang big 
 none 	yes 
 none 	send it via email 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and we are sending them the compressed ones  right 
 none 	i don t know  wha  whatever you generate  yeah  the last ones you did were compressed 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	were  shortened   yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	wonder if the ones before that were shortened 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the beep files  actually   the  shorten  doesn t save a whole lot 
 none 	right  because the whole point is that it s extracting pie  pars  parts that are loud anyway 
 none 	cuz it s all  
 none 	it s all speech  yeah  yeah 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	so 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i think it only saves  like  half  only 
 none 	only 
 none 	o_k  so i think we just gotta let things slide for now  and see   see what s gonna happen  nothing else really to do 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um 
 none 	we have new equipment that i m gonna try to set up tomorrow 
 none 	new wireless 
 none 	what will that do  is that going to    
 none 	and so  uh  
 none 	give us a couple more wireless channels 
 none 	oh  so we can get rid of the uh  
 none 	yep 
 none 	oh  that ll be nice 
 none 	yep 
 find_calendar_entry 	but it involves rewiring   and so  if i could borrow  someone   tomorrow afternoon  to help my brain   you know  just have someone to bounce the instructions off of and make sure i don t do anything too stupid 
 none 	i should be around 
 none 	yeah  sure 
 open_agenda 	did i have another topic on the   on the list  
 none 	experiments 
 none 	isn t that next week 
 none 	experiments  yeah 
 none 	that s  
 none 	yeah  i guess that s probably next  yeah 
 find_email 	wha  what did i have on the  agenda   i  mailed out  
 none 	these are next week 
 none 	i think it was   oh yeah  i don t know 
 none 	the demo  demo and i_b_m  i think 
 none 	something about  
 none 	the demo was one of them 
 none 	demo 
 none 	yeah  that s it  that was it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i think that s it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	short meeting 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	short meeting  does anyone have anything else 
 none 	oh  i made a  
 none 	oh  but that s not specific to meeting recorder  i was gonna say i took some   a suggestion of adam s  and i  um  created a m  c_g_i script that lets you see the current status of the speech disks 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so if you go to the speech local web page  and then there s a disk status page  you can click on that and it ll query abbott  and give you a   a list of all the disks that we have and then  uh  what s on each one  and then it shows how big the disk is and what percent full it is 
 none 	cool 
 none 	so  and that s  you know  each time you go there  it s updated  so 
 none 	so  the new disks are installed now  or    
 none 	so what   what  
 none 	the new disks are installed  if you need space just let me know  i have to create the p  appropriate sub directory  so we re s  kinda trying to keep   even the scratch ones we re keeping a little organized  where we put a y  a u_ doctor speech data  and then
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i ll either create a sub directory for  like if it s meeting recorder project  or hub five or whatever  so we c  i just have to create those sub directories  and
 none 	o_k 
 none 	do we have new d_d disks also 
 none 	no 
 none 	darn 
 none 	no 
 none 	nnn 
 none 	so  it s all just scratch 
 none 	it s all scratch 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	how are we doing on  
 none 	uh  d_e  which is where we re putting all the meeting stuff  
 none 	no  d_e is full  we must be doing it on d_ f 
 none 	no  it s d_ e 
 none 	d_ e  i think  yeah 
 none 	d_ e s not full 
 none 	d_ d is full 
 none 	d_d s full  that was the first one 
 none 	or  that was the last one that w  filled up  and   d_e still had like  last time i looked it was like seven gigs or something  so 
 none 	o_k  i guess i m just one off 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and each meeting is roughly half a gig  and so 
 none 	half 
 none 	so that means we re p  getting pretty close 
 none 	we re getting close  yeah  so 
 none 	shoot 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	are we g  just gonna keep recording  like  at some point  
 none 	morgan said something about stopping at the end of the year  like when we get around a hundred meetings 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um  because there s gonna be data coming from u_w  hopefully by then 
 none 	cuz u 
 none 	i just hate not to get data 
 none 	how m 
 none 	you re a data fiend 
 none 	yeah  it feels funny  huh  if we have the capability 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  it s like you build this room up for so long  and then it s just like  you stop 
 none 	now that we re used to recording  it s like  eh  well  why not keep going 
 none 	i   the other thing we could do is stop doing the regular ones 
 none 	and try to convince other topics to come in and do some  cuz i think that would be nice 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	we have right now  like  seventy five or seventy six hours of meetings 
 none 	yeah  the other thing we were talking about also is once we exp  once the disk has been backed up  we don t actually need it on line 
 none 	so another option is to copy it to tape manually so we have the back up copy and the tape copy  the archive copy and the back up copy  and then just take them off line 
 none 	but aren t we still using the  uh  compressed  
 none 	once we have the expanded versions  so if we have a ton of scratch disk maybe the thing to do is leave those up  and then use  
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and then not necessarily have the original data on line 
 none 	yeah  we need to figure something out  cuz the  
 none 	abbott is basically   e  e  we can t add anymore disks to it  we can increase the size of the disks that are on it  but that will only take us so far  so  um 
 none 	full 
 create_single_reminder 	david had the suggestion about  you know  new servers and things like that  and so  i m  gonna see  if we can talk to morgan about getting some money for a new disk server   
 none 	and  uh  
 none 	well  that would be pretty tight i  in the machine room 
 none 	yeah  it would have to replace abbott  basically 
 none 	eesh 
 none 	yeah  well  he   david s planning to get new servers anyways for all of the main servers 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i think he wants to sorta go with the same type of machine for all of these  but  um  
 none 	yeah  it s full in there  have you seen it recently with all of the new machines that we got   uh  the sun blade one hundreds  they re like stacked up on benches and things all over 
 none 	mm mmm 
 none 	it s really crowded 
 none 	so 
 none 	but they are not yet accessible   the new machines  
 none 	oh  yeah  yeah  yeah  they re in the   yeah  if you do a p_make  
 none 	yeah  they are 
 none 	oop 
 search 	what are  they  called    what are  they  named  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  i ve forgotten now  um 
 none 	i assume they re in the p_make pool 
 none 	yeah  they re in the p_make pool  so if you do a  reginfo minus show attribute   and uh  
 none 	a what 
 none 	a r 
 none 	p_make stuff  p_make magic  or customs magic 
 none 	yeah  y 
 none 	oh god 
 none 	you can get a list of all the machines that are available to p_make  by using the command  reginfo minus show a_t_t_r  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	 reginfo    o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 send_email 	maybe  you  can send  me   that   
 none 	yeah  and then  um  
 none 	if you do  man customs   it has almost all of that 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and   i for  i m not sure what attributes we attach to the sun blade one hundreds  but it could be s_b one hundred  and so if you query for f  all machines that have that attribute  then you should see the names of the new machines  but 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	do we have an attribute for non interactive machines 
 none 	cuz i was thinking that would be a good one to have 
 none 	non interactive  
 none 	ones that aren t on people s desks 
 none 	well  there s sort of  there s this one called  
 none 	there s the attribute called  no   what s that called  uh   n    no   uh   no evict  
 none 	which is roughly that 
 none 	y  right 
 none 	it s   although it s like it  h  my machine has it on my desk  so  i do get jobs running on my machine all the time 
 none 	um 
 none 	but  uh 
 none 	so   so that s   that s sort of what it is 
 none 	yep 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	anyway 
 none 	shall we do digits
