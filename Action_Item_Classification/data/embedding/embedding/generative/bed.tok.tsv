 none 	nice 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	to   to handle 
 none 	is that good 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  i ve have never handled them 
 none 	goats eat cans  to my understanding 
 none 	did we need to do these things 
 none 	tin cans 
 none 	you don t need to read the digits if we think that that s torture but the reason these are out there is do put your name on it because it s the only record i have of actually who was sitting there 
 none 	wow  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um  your name and some but it  
 none 	o_k  you should be in play  
 none 	and we can   you can flip this and uh get rid of the screen but
 none 	could i hit   hit f_seven to do that  on the  
 none 	the uh   the   the remote
 none 	robert 
 none 	oh  the remote will do it o_k  cuz i m already up there 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i m in control here 
 create_single_reminder 	o_k  have a great meeting  i ll   i ll come back up in about an hour and check and see if you re still meeting  
 none 	you are in control 
 none 	all ready 
 none 	wow  we re all so high tech here  yet another p  powerpoint presentation 
 none 	i   well it makes it easier to do powerpoint 
 none 	certainly does 
 none 	so  we were   ah 
 none 	johno  where are you 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so 
 none 	let s see  which one of these buttons will do this for me 
 none 	aha  o_k 
 none 	should you go back to the first one 
 none 	well  
 none 	do i wanna go back to the first one  o_k 
 none 	i m sorry i  
 none 	well  i mean  just to  
 none 	o_k  introduce 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  um  well   the search for the middle layer   it s basically uh talks about uh   it just refers to the fact that uh one of main things we had to do was to decide what the intermediate sort of nodes were  you know  because  
 none 	i can read  i m kidding 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but if you really want to find out what it s about you have to click on the little light bulb 
 search 	although i ve   i ve never    i don t know  what the light bulb is for    i didn t i  install that into my  powerpoint presentation  
 none 	it opens the assistant that tells you that the font type is too small 
 none 	ah 
 none 	do you wanna try 
 none 	ach u 
 none 	i d prefer not to 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	continue 
 none 	it s a needless good idea  is that the idea  o_k 
 none 	why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode 
 none 	because i m gonna switch to the javabayes program and then if i do that it ll mess everything up 
 none 	oh  o_k  of course  mm hmm 
 none 	i was wondering 
 none 	is that o_k 
 none 	yeah  it s o_k 
 none 	sure 
 open_setting 	can you maximize the window  
 none 	proceed 
 none 	you want me to   wait  what do you want me to do 
 open_setting 	can you maximize the window so all that stuff on the side isn t   doesn t appear 
 none 	no  it s o_k  it s   it ll work  
 none 	well i can do that  but then i have to end the presentation in the middle so i can go back to open up javabayes 
 none 	o_k  fine 
 none 	here  let s see if i can  
 none 	alright 
 none 	very nice 
 none 	is that better 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh   i ll also get rid of this  click to add notes  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	perfect 
 none 	so then the features we decided   or we decided we were   talked about  right 
 none 	uh the   the prosody  the discourse  verb choice  you know  we had a list of things like
 none 	 to go  and  to visit  and what not 
 none 	the  landmark iness  of uh  
 none 	i knew you d like that 
 none 	nice coinage 
 none 	thank you  uh  of a   of a building 
 none 	whether the  and this i  we actually have a separate feature but i decided to put it on the same line for space 
 none 	 nice walls  which we can look up because i mean if you re gonna get real close to a building in the tango mode  right  there s gotta be a reason for it 
 none 	and it s either because you re in route to something else or you wanna look at the walls 
 none 	the context  which in this case we ve limited to  business person    tourist   or  unknown   the time of day  and  open to suggestions   isn t actually a feature 
 none 	it s  we are open to suggestions  
 none 	right  can i just ask the nice walls part of it is that uh  in this particular domain   you said   be   i  it could be on two different lines but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the   that landmark iness cor  is correlated with their being nice w  o_k 
 none 	no  we have a separate feature 
 none 	oh  
 none 	they re separate things 
 none 	yeah  i either could put  nice walls  on its own line or  open to suggestions  off the slide 
 none 	and   and  
 none 	like you could have a p 
 none 	by  nice  you mean  
 none 	you   like you could have a post office with uh   you know  nice murals or something 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k  so  nice walls  is a stand in for like architecturally it  uh   significant or something like that 
 none 	or one time i was at this  
 none 	architecturally appealing from the outside 
 none 	but see the thing is  if it s  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah but if it s architecturally significant you might be able to see it from  
 none 	like you m  might be able to  vista  it  right  and be able to  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	appreciate it 
 none 	yeah  versus  like  i was at this place in europe where they had little carvings of  like  dead people on the walls or something 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i don t remember w 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	it was a long time ago 
 none 	there s a lot of those 
 none 	but if you looked at it real close  you could see the   the in  intricacy of the   of the walls 
 none 	o_k  so that count as   counts as a nice wall 
 none 	right 
 none 	the   o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	something you want to inspect at close range because it s interesting  o_k 
 none 	the  
 none 	exactly 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	robert 
 search 	well there   there is a term that s often used  that s  saliency   or the  salience  of an object 
 none 	and i was just wondering whether that s the same as what you describe as  landmark iness  
 none 	but it s really not  i mean an object can be very salient but not a landmark at all 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	not a landmark at all 
 none 	there s landmark for um  touristic reasons and landmark for i don t know navigational reasons or something 
 none 	right 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  we meant  uh  touristic reasons 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k  but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth  both kinds of things there for different um  goals 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	tourist y landmarks also happen to be  
 none 	wouldn t   couldn t they also be  
 none 	they re not exclusive groups  are they 
 none 	like non tourist y landmarks and direct navigational   yeah 
 none 	or it can be als 
 none 	they re not mutually exclusive 
 none 	right  right  definitely 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  so our initial idea was not very satisfying  because   uh our initial idea was basically all the features pointing to the output node 
 none 	uh 
 none 	so  a big flat structure  right 
 none 	right 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and uh  so we  
 none 	reasons being  you know  it d be a pain to set up all the probabilities for that 
 none 	if we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort  uh according bhaskara we d be handicapped 
 search 	i don t know belief nets very well 
 none 	well usually  i mean  you know  n_  
 none 	if you have n_ features  then it s two to the n_   or exponential in n_ 
 none 	and they wouldn t look pretty 
 none 	so 
 none 	yeah  they d all be like pointing to the one node 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh 
 none 	so then our next idea was to add a middle layer  right 
 none 	so the thinking behind that was we have the features that we ve drawn from the communication of some  
 none 	like  the someone s 
 none 	the person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea  like
 none 	 i m    the   the abstract idea being  i am a tourist i want to go to this place  
 none 	right 
 none 	so we re gonna set up features along the lines of where they want to go and what they ve said previously and whatnot  and then we have the means that they should use  right  but the middle thing  we were thinking along the lines of maybe trying to figure out  like  the concept of whether they re a tourist or whether they re running an errand or something like that along those lines 
 none 	or  
 none 	yes  we could  things we couldn t extract the   from the data  the hidden variables  yes  good 
 none 	so then the hidden variables   hair  variables we came up with were whether someone was on a tour  running an errand  or whether they were in a hurry  because we were thinking uh  if they were in a hurry there d be less likely to   like   or th 
 none 	want to do vista  right  because if you want to view things you wouldn t be in a hurry 
 none 	right 
 none 	or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to as a   like a navigational point to go to another place 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	whether the destination was their final destination  whether the destination was closed  those are all  
 none 	and then
 search 	 let s look at the belief net  o_k  so that means that i should switch to the other program 
 none 	um right now it s still kind of in a toy version of it  because we didn t know the probabilities of   or  
 none 	well i ll talk about it when i get the picture up 
 none 	no one knows it 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so this right   what we  
 none 	let s see  what happens if i maximize this 
 none 	there we go 
 none 	but uh  
 none 	so 
 none 	the mode basically has three different outputs 
 none 	the probability   whether the probability of a vista  tango  or enter 
 none 	um  
 none 	the  context   we simplified  basically it s just the businessman  the tourist  unknown 
 none 	 verb used  is actually personally amusing mainly because it s   it s just whether the verb is a tango verb  an enter verb  or a vista verb 
 none 	yeah  that one needs a lot of  
 none 	and are those mutually exclusive sets  right  got it  uh huh 
 none 	not at all  that s   that   that needs a lot of work  but uh that would ve made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter  so we decided that for the purposes of this it d be simpler to just have three verbs 
 none 	no 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	simple 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	stab at it  yep 
 none 	right 
 none 	um  
 none 	why don t you mention things about this  bhaskara  that i am   not   that are not coming to my mind right now 
 none 	o_k  so   yeah  so note the four nodes down there  the   sort of  the things that are not directly extracted 
 none 	actually  the five things  the  closed  is also not directly extracted i guess  from the uh  
 none 	from the utterance 
 none 	well i  it s   it s so  it sort of is because it s   because have the   the time of day and the close  it just had the   er and what time it closed 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	actually  no  wait  it is  o_k   closed  sort of is 
 none 	right  so f 
 none 	right  but the other ones  the final destination  the whether they re doing business  whether they re in a hurry  and whether they re tourists  that kind of thing is all uh sort of   you know probabilistically depends on the other things  yeah 
 none 	inferred from the other ones 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and the mode  you know  depends on all those things only 
 none 	yeah the   the actual parse is somewhere up around in here 
 none 	yeah  so we haven t uh  managed   like we don t have nodes for  discourse  and  parse   although like in some sense they are parts of this belief net  but uh  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	the idea is that we just extract those features from them  so we don t actually have a node for the entire parse  because we d never do inference on it anyway  so 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 search 	so some of the   the top row of things   what s   what s   disc admission fee    
 none 	whether they discuss the admission fees  so we looked at the data and in a lot of data people were saying things like  can i get to this place    what is the admission fee    so that s like a huge uh clue that they re trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista  so 
 none 	oh 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k  i see 
 none 	there were   there d be other things besides just the admission fee  but you know  we didn t have  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	that was like our example 
 none 	that was the initial one that we found 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k  so there are certain cues that are very strong either lexical or topic based um  concept cues for one of those 
 none 	from the discourse that  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and then in that second row or whatever that row of time of day through that  
 none 	so all of those  
 none 	some of them come from the utterance and some of them are sort of either world knowledge or situational things  right  so that you have no distinction between those and  o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	one  uh  
 none 	uh 
 none 	um  anything else you want to say bhaskara 
 none 	um 
 none 	 unmark  time of day 
 none 	yeah  i m  i mean  
 none 	one thing   uh  
 none 	yeah  they re   they re are a couple of more things  i mean
 none 	uh 
 none 	i would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we   we all uh  agree on what   what the meaning of these things is at the moment and maybe what changes we  
 none 	yeah  th 
 none 	o_k  so one thing i   i m you know unsure about  is how we have the discus  uh   the  admission fee  thing set up 
 none 	so one thing that we were thinking was by doing the layers like this 
 none 	uh   we kept um   things from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept  but you could see perhaps discus  the  admission fee  going directly to the mode pointing at  enter   right  versus pointing to  just at  tourist  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but we just decided to keep all the things we extracted to point at the middle and then down 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	why is the landmark  
 none 	o_k  the landmark is facing to the tourists 
 none 	that s because we re talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks not as possible um navigational landmarks so
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	navigational landmarks  yeah 
 none 	navigational cue 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	then  
 none 	yeah  that would be whatever building they referred to 
 none 	prosody 
 none 	right  so let s see  the variables  disc   admission fee  is a binary thing   time of day  is like morning  afternoon  night  is that the deal 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s how we have it currently set up  but it could be  you know  based upon hour or dis  we could discrete it   des  descret ize it 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	whatever granularity  uh huh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  normally context will include a huge amount of information  but um  we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they re a tourist or not  i guess 
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k  so that s given in their input  right 
 none 	right 
 none 	so   right  so it s not really all of context  similarly prosody is not all of prosody but simply for our purposes whether or not they appear tense or relaxed  and
 none 	mm hmm  that s very nice  huh 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	the   the   so the context is a switch between tourist or non tourist  or also unknown 
 none 	or un  unknown  yeah 
 none 	yeah  unknown  right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so final dest 
 none 	so it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist  but o_k  so the the context being um  e  i don t know if that question s sort of in general   are you   
 none 	which is th  which one 
 none 	i mean the   ar  ar  are do they allow business people to be doing non business things at the moment 
 none 	yeah  it does 
 none 	o_k  so then you just have some probabilities over   o_k    over which which of those it is 
 none 	everything is probablistic  and  
 none 	there s always  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  right  so then landmark is  
 none 	oh  sorry   verb used  is like  right now we only have three values  but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verbs 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	rather  let me rephrase that  it   it can take values in the set of all verbs  that they could possibly use 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  nice walls  is binary   closed  is binary  final destination   again   yeah  all those are binary i guess 
 none 	and  mode  is one of three things 
 none 	so  the   the middle layer is also binary  no 
 none 	yeah  anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node 
 none 	uh 
 none 	it  
 none 	yeah  but all those things without question marks are also binary  right 
 none 	which things 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	nice walls 
 none 	wi 
 none 	oh   nice walls  is uh   something that we extract from our world knowledge 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  a  oh yeah  sorry  it is binary 
 none 	it is binary but it doesn t have question mark because it s extracted  yeah 
 none 	that s true 
 none 	yeah  o_k  i see your point 
 none 	yeah  o_k  i   i gotcha 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	yeah  similarly  closed   i guess 
 none 	so we can either be in a hurry or not  but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment 
 none 	well  we 
 none 	to do that we would add another uh   value for that 
 none 	mm hmm  o_k 
 none 	and that would require s  updating the probability distribution for  mode  as well 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	because it would now have to like uh   take that possibility into account 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	take a conti 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so um  of course this will happen when we think more about the kinds of verbs that are used in each cases but you can imagine that it s verb plus various other things that are also not in the bottom layer that would   that would help you  
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	like it s a conjunction of  i don t know  you know  the verb used and some other stuff that   that would determine   yeah  exactly 
 none 	right  other syntactic information you mean  yeah 
 none 	um 
 none 	well the   the   sort of the landmark is   is sort of the object right  the argument in a sense 
 none 	usually  i   i don t know if that s always the case i   i guess haven t looked at the data as much as you guys have  so  um 
 none 	that s always warping on something   some entity  and um  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh maybe at this stage we will   we do want to   uh sort of get   uh modifiers in there because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i want to get to the church quickly  and uh  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	that would be a cue 
 none 	yeah  right 
 none 	what s the fastest way
 none 	yeah  correct 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um 
 none 	right  excellent 
 none 	do we have anything else to say about this 
 none 	we can do a little demo 
 none 	oh the  yeah  we could 
 none 	but the demo doesn t work very well 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	no  then it wouldn t be a demo
 none 	i mean  
 none 	we can do a demo in the sense that we can um  just ob  observe the fact that this will  in fact do inference  so we can  you know  set some of the uh nodes and then try to find the probability of other nodes 
 none 	i was just gonna s 
 none 	observe nodes 
 none 	yeah  go ahead 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	dat dat dah 
 none 	what should i observe 
 none 	just se  set a few of them  you don t have to do the whole thing that we did last time  just like uh  maybe the fact that they use a certain verb   actually forget the verb  just uh  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i don t know  say they discussed the admission fee  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and uh   the place has nice walls
 none 	i love nice walls  o_k 
 none 	i m a big fan 
 none 	it s starting to grow on me
 none 	and it s night 
 none 	and the time of day is night 
 none 	yeah  no wait  that   that doesn t uh   it s not really consistent  they don t discuss the admission fee  make that false 
 none 	alright 
 none 	and it s night 
 none 	oh  they  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh whoops  i forgot to uh  
 none 	that didn t work 
 none 	ach 
 none 	i d like to do that again 
 none 	one thing that bugs me about javabayes is you have to click that and do this 
 none 	yeah  that seems kind of redundant but 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	that all you want 
 none 	yes 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so let s see  i want to query  right  the mode 
 none 	 go  and  right   query  
 none 	o_k  and then on here  
 none 	so let s see 
 none 	so that is the probability that they re entering  vista ing or tango ing  and uh  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so slightly biased toward  tango ing
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	if it s night time  they have not discussed admission fee  and the n  walls are nice  so  yeah 
 none 	i guess that sort of makes sense 
 none 	the reason i say the demo doesn t work very well is yesterday we uh   observed everything in favor of taking a tour  and it came up as  tango   right  over and over again 
 none 	so 
 none 	we couldn t   we couldn t figure out how to turn it off of  tango  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	huh 
 none 	it loves the tango 
 none 	um 
 none 	well  that s obviously just to do with our probabilities  like  we totally hand tuned the probabilities  right  we were like
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	 hmm  well if the person does this and this and this  let s say forty percent for this  fifty per   like  you know 
 none 	so obviously that s gonna happen 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah but it   it
 none 	maybe the bias toward  tango ing was yours  then 
 none 	yeah  that s   that s at  
 none 	yeah  it s   so we have to like fit the probabilities 
 none 	spent my youth practicing the tango de la muerte 
 none 	so  the real case 
 none 	however you know  it  
 none 	the purpose was not really  at this stage  to come up with meaningful probabilities but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and so th 
 none 	and  
 none 	we would actually  
 none 	i guess once we look at the data more we ll get more hidden nodes  but
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i d like to see more 
 none 	not because it would expedite the probabilities  cuz it wouldn t 
 none 	it would actually slow that down tremendously 
 none 	um  well  yeah  i guess  not that much though  only a little early  
 none 	but 
 none 	no  i think we should have uh   exponentially more middle nodes than features we ve extracted 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i m ju  i m just jo 
 none 	so  are  doing business  versus  tourist    they refer to your current task  like   like current thing you want to do at this moment 
 none 	um  yeah  well  
 none 	that s   that s an interesting point  whether you re  
 none 	it s whether  
 none 	and are th 
 none 	it s not  
 none 	i think it s more like  are you are tourist  are you in ham  like heidelberg for a   
 none 	oh  so  i thought that was directly given by the context switch 
 none 	that s a different thing  what if the context  which is not set  but still they say things like   i want to go uh  see the uh   the   the castle and uh  et cetera  
 none 	is it  
 none 	well the 
 none 	i kind of thought of  doing business  as more of running an errand type thing 
 none 	yeah  business on the other hand is  uh  definitely what you re doing 
 none 	so if you run out of cash as a tourist  and   and   and you need to go to the a_t 
 none 	so i  wi  th 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh  i see  you may have a task  wh  you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	 how do i get to the bank  
 none 	i see 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	and that ll affect whether you want to enter or you if you   kinda thing 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so the  tourists  node should be um  very consistent with the context node  right  if you say that s more their   in general what their background is 
 none 	yeah  i think this context node is a bit of a  
 none 	i don t know  like in d 
 none 	uh  
 none 	do we wanna have  
 none 	like it s  
 none 	are you assuming that or not  like is that to be  
 none 	i mean if that s accurate then that would determine tourist node 
 none 	if the context were to set one way or another  that like strongly uh um  says something about whether   whether or not they re tourists  so what s interesting is when it s not   when it s set to  unknown  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	we  what set the   they set the context to  unknown  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	right now we haven t observed it  so i guess it s sort of averaging over all those three possibilities 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	but yes  you can set it to un   unknown  
 none 	and if we now do   leave everything else as is the results should be the same  right 
 none 	oops 
 none 	no 
 none 	well no  because we  
 none 	th  the way we set the probabilities might not have  
 none 	yeah  it s   it s an   it s an issue  right  like  
 none 	pretty much the same 
 none 	yeah  it is 
 none 	so the issue is that um in belief nets  it s not common to do what we did of like having  you know  a d  bunch of values and then  unknown  as an actual value 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what s common is you just like don t observe the variable  right  and then just marginalizes  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yep 
 none 	but uh  
 none 	we didn t do this because we felt that there d  
 none 	i guess we were thinking in terms of a switch that actually  
 none 	we were thi  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	we were th 
 none 	but uh   i don t know y  what the right thing is to do for that  i m not  
 none 	i don t know if i totally am happy with the way it is 
 none 	why don t we  
 none 	can we  um  
 none 	how long would it take to   to add another node on the observatory and  um  play around with it 
 none 	another node on what 
 none 	uh  well it depends on how many things it s linked to 
 none 	let s just say make it really simple  if we create something that for example would be um  
 none 	so th  some things can be landmarks in your sense but they can never be entered  so for example s  a statue 
 none 	good point 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so maybe we wanna have  landmark  meaning now   enterable landmark  versus  um something that s simply just a vista point  for example 
 none 	yeah  that s true 
 none 	yeah  uh  a statue or um  
 none 	so basically it s addressing a variable that s  enterable or not   so like an  enterable  question mark  
 none 	also   you know  didn t we have a size as one 
 none 	what 
 none 	the size of the landmark 
 none 	um  not when we were doing this  but i guess at some point we did 
 none 	cuz if it s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	for some reason i had that  
 none 	o_k  that was a thought that i had at one point but then went away 
 none 	so you want to have a   a node for like whether or not it can be entered 
 none 	well  for example  if we include that  yeah  um  accessibility or something  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	 is it   can it be entered   then of course  this is sort of binary as well 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and then um  there s also the question whether it may be entered 
 none 	in the sense that  you know  if it s tom   the house of tom cruise  you know  it s enterable but you may not enter it 
 none 	you know  you re not allowed to 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	unless you are  whatever  his   his divorce lawyer or something  yeah  and um  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	way 
 none 	and these are very observable sort of from the   from the ontology sort of things 
 none 	does it actually help to distinguish between those two cases though 
 none 	whether it s practically speaking enterable  or actually physically enterable or not 
 none 	it seems like it would for uh  uh determining whether they wanna go into it or not 
 none 	y  y 
 none 	cuz they  
 none 	if  
 none 	well i can see why  
 none 	if you re running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not al  w  you re not usually   not allowed to uh  m 
 none 	let s get this uh b  clearer 
 none 	s  so it s matrix between if it s not enterable  period 
 none 	whether it s a   whether it s a public building  and whether it s   actually has a door 
 none 	yeah  exactly 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	this is sort of uh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so tom cruise s house is not a public building but it has a door 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but the thing is  
 none 	o_k  sh  explain to me why it s necessary to distinguish between whether something has a door and is not public 
 none 	or  if something  
 none 	it seems like it s equivalent to say that it doesn t have a door a  and it  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	or  not public  and  not a door  are equivalent things  it seems like in practice 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so we would have  
 none 	what does it mean  then  that we have to   we have an object type statue  that really is an object type 
 none 	right 
 none 	so there is   there s gonna be a bunch of statues 
 none 	and then we have  for example  an object type  hmm  that s a hotel  how about hotels 
 none 	o_k 
 search 	so  the most famous building in heidelberg is actually a hotel 
 none 	it s the hotel zum ritter  which is the only renaissance building in heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the thirty years war  blah blah blah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	does it have nice walls 
 none 	it has wonderful walls 
 none 	excellent 
 none 	um 
 none 	and lots of detail  c  and carvings  engravings and so forth  so 
 none 	but  um  it s still an unlikely candidate for the tango mode i must say 
 none 	but 
 none 	um  so   s 
 none 	so if you are a d 
 none 	well it s very tricky 
 none 	so i guess your question is   so far i have no really arg  no real argument why to differentiate between statues as   statues and houses of celebrities  from that point of view 
 none 	huh 
 none 	o_k  let   let s do a  
 none 	can we add  just so i can see how it s done  uh  a  has door  property or    
 none 	o_k 
 none 	what would it  uh  connect to  like  what would  uh  it affect 
 none 	um  i think  um  it might affect  
 none 	oh actually it s   it   it wouldn t affect any of our nodes  right 
 none 	what i was thinking was if you had a   like  
 none 	oh it s   it affects th 
 none 	the  doing business  is certainly not 
 none 	you could affect  
 none 	theoretically you could affect  doing business  with  has door  
 none 	yeah  o_k 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	it should  um  inhibit that  right 
 none 	right 
 none 	let s see 
 search 	yeah  i don t know if  javabayes  is nice about that  it might be that  if you add a new thing pointing to a variable  you just like   it just overwrites everything  
 none 	but you can check 
 none 	well  we have it saved  so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	we can rel  open it up again 
 none 	it s true 
 none 	the safety net 
 none 	i think you could just add it  i mean  i have before o_k  whew 
 none 	well that s fine  but we have to see the function now  has it become all point fives or not 
 none 	oh  right 
 none 	let s see  so this is
 none 	 has door 
 none 	uh  true  false  that s acceptable 
 none 	and i want to edit the function going to that  right 
 none 	no  this is fine  this business 
 none 	oh no 
 none 	right  it was fine   2x added this one 
 none 	yep 
 none 	what would be nice if it   is if it just like kept the old function for either value but 
 none 	this  
 none 	nope 
 none 	oh 
 none 	didn t do it 
 none 	oh wait  it might be  
 none 	did we w 
 none 	yes  that s not good 
 none 	that s kind of annoying 
 none 	o_k  so just dis  dismiss everything 
 none 	close it and   and load up the old state so it doesn t screw   screw that up 
 none 	let s see 
 none 	oops 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	maybe you can read in 
 none 	ha 
 none 	so have you used  javabayes  a lot 
 none 	yes  really i ha  i ve  
 none 	i haven t used it a lot and i haven t used it in the last you know many months so um  uh  we can ask someone 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	it might be worth uh   asking around  like  we looked at sort of uh   a page that had like a bunch of  
 none 	um 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	srini  
 none 	o_k  yeah  s  i guess he d be the person 
 send_email 	srini s  the one to ask i would say   um  he might know 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	cuz   yeah 
 none 	and 
 none 	i mean in a way this is a lot of good features in java it s cra  has a gui and it s uh  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i guess those are the main two things  it does learning  it has  
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	no it doesn t  actually 
 none 	what 
 none 	i didn t think it did learning 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	maybe it did a little bit of learning  i don t remember 
 none 	oh right  maybe you re right  o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	but uh   it s free 
 none 	which is w  quite positive  yeah 
 none 	but uh  yeah 
 none 	maybe another thing that uh  
 none 	but i mean its interface is not the greatest  so 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but actually it had an interface  a lot of them were like  you know 
 none 	yep 
 none 	command line 
 none 	huh 
 none 	what is the c  code  can w  can we see that 
 none 	how do you write the code or do you actually never have to write any code there 
 none 	the c 
 none 	yeah  there is actually a text file that you can edit 
 none 	but it s   you don t have to do that 
 none 	there s like an x_m_l format for bayes nets 
 none 	is it x_m_l 
 none 	the  there is one  i don t know if this uses it 
 none 	oh  i see  no this doesn t use it 
 none 	but it  
 none 	i didn t think it did 
 none 	yeah  the   the  
 none 	you can look at the text file 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but do you have it here 
 none 	well  maybe you don t 
 none 	uh  yes i do actually  let me see 
 none 	oh yes  of course  like  there s the  
 none 	oh man  i didn t n 
 none 	is there an ampersand in dos 
 none 	nope  just s  l  start up a new d_o_s 
 none 	we  that s alright  i can probably double cli  click on it 
 none 	or   yeah  right 
 none 	n  uh  
 none 	let s see 
 none 	yep 
 none 	let s see  come on 
 none 	it ll ask you what you   what it wants   what you want to open it with and see what bat   i guess 
 none 	one of these days  it should open this  theoretically 
 none 	go   right mouse 
 none 	open with 
 none 	that s   oh 
 none 	oh there we go 
 none 	maybe it was just  
 none 	oh  w 
 none 	oh 
 none 	ah  it was dead 
 none 	to the world 
 none 	god 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	through the old notepad  that s my favorite editor 
 none 	i like  
 none 	wordpad 
 none 	i like word pad because it has the uh   the returns  the carriage returns on some of them 
 none 	i  
 none 	mm hmm  o_k 
 none 	you know how they get  auto fills  i guess  or whatever you call it 
 none 	mmm hmm 
 none 	anyway  there it is 
 none 	so this is sort of lisp y 
 none 	no 
 none 	uh  yeah 
 none 	it just basically looks like it just specifies a bunch of structs 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s how actual probability tables are specified  as  like  lists of numbers 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so theoretically you could edit that 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but they re not very friendly 
 none 	it just that   it s  
 none 	yeah the ordering isn t very clear on  
 none 	right 
 none 	so you d have to like figure out  
 none 	the layout of the table  yeah 
 none 	like you have to go and   yeah 
 none 	well i  
 none 	actually we could write a program that could generate this 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think so  it s not  
 none 	you could 
 none 	yeah you could 
 none 	we were doing it  
 none 	yeah we can maybe write an interface th  for uh entering probability distributions easily  something like   like a little script 
 none 	that might be worth it 
 none 	and that might do 
 none 	yeah  i actually seem to recall srini complaining about something to do with entering probability so this is probably
 none 	yeah  it s   yeah 
 none 	the other thing is it is in java so 
 none 	we could manipulate the source itself  or  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	do you have the true source files or just the class 
 none 	i don t know if he actually  
 none 	yeah  uh  yeah  we do
 none 	does he  
 none 	i   i saw directory called  source   or  
 none 	oh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i didn t e 
 none 	yeah  go up one 
 none 	up one 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	ah yes  good   source  
 none 	that s   that s quite nice 
 none 	i don t know if it actually manipulate the source  though  that might be a bit complicated  i think it might   it might be simpler to just have a script that  you know  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	it s  like  friendly  it allows you enter things well 
 none 	the d  the data tables 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	but if th  if there is an x_m_l file that   or format that it can also read  
 none 	i mean it just reads this  right  when it starts 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah i know there is an   i was looking on the we  web page and he s updated it for an x_m_l version of i guess bayes nets  there s a bayes net spec for   in x_m_l 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	he s   like this guy has  the javabayes guy  so   but  e  he doesn t use it  so in what sense has he updated it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well th  you can either   you ca  or you can read both 
 none 	oh  i see 
 none 	to my understanding 
 none 	o_k  that would be awesome 
 none 	oh 
 none 	because uh  
 none 	well at least the   uh  
 none 	i could have misread the web page  i have a habit of doing that  but 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  wonderful 
 none 	so you got more slides 
 none 	do i have more slides 
 none 	um yes  one more   future work   i think every presentation have a should have a  future work  slide 
 none 	but uh it s basically   we already talked about all this stuff  so 
 none 	um  the additional thing is i guess learning the probabilities  also 
 none 	e  that s maybe  i don t know  
 none 	if   does  
 none 	uh that s future future work 
 none 	that s   yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	very future 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and of course if you have a presentation that doesn t   have something that doesn t work at all  then you have  what i learned   as a slide 
 none 	can t you have both 
 none 	you could 
 none 	my first approach failed 
 none 	right 
 none 	what i learned  o_k  so i think that uh  our presentation s finished 
 none 	good 
 none 	i know what i like about these meetings is one person will nod  and then the next person will nod  and then it just goes all the way around the room 
 none 	so the uh  
 none 	i missed my turn 
 none 	no i   earlier i went and bhaskara went and you did it  you did it 
 none 	it s like yawning 
 none 	it s like yawning 
 none 	and this announcement was in stereo 
 none 	ha 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so this means um  
 none 	should i pull up the net again  yes 
 none 	yeah  could you put the   the um  net up again  thanks 
 none 	there we go 
 none 	and actually i was   cuz i got a wireless mike on 
 none 	so a more general thing than  discussed admission fee  um  could be   i   i m just wondering whether the context  the background context of the discourse might be  
 none 	i don t know  if there s a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way um  there might be other cues that  say  um  in the last few utterances there has been something that has strongly associated with say one of the particular modes uh  i don t know if that might be   uh  and   and into that node would be various   various things that   that could have specifically come up 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i think we  
 none 	i think a   a sort of general strategy here  
 none 	you know  this is   this is excellent because   um it gets you thinking along these terms   is that maybe we ob  we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee  and something else and something else  that happened in the discourse before 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	and um   let s make those four 
 none 	and maybe there are two um  
 none 	so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net  which has two   has it s own middle layer 
 none 	maybe this  you know  has some kind of um  funky thing that di  if this and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse which is maybe something that is uh  a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe  so things that point towards  
 none 	so instead of single node  for like  if they said the word  admission fee   
 none 	exactly  yeah 
 none 	 admission fee   or maybe  you know   how much to enter  or you know something  other cues  exactly 
 none 	opening hours or something like that 
 none 	that would all f  funnel into one node that would constitute entrance requirements or something like that 
 none 	so   pay a visit    uh  uh  d 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	sure  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean it sort of get into plan recognition kinds of things in the discourse  i mean that s like the bigger um  version of it 
 none 	exactly  yeah  and then maybe there are some discourse acts if they happened before  um it s more for um a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else and that you are in a   in a   in a route um  sort of proceeding past these things  so this would be just something that   where you want to pass it  hmm 
 none 	is that it 
 none 	however these are of course then the   the nodes  the observed nodes  for your middle layer 
 none 	so this again points to  final destination    doing business    tourist hurry  and so forth 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and so then we can say   o_k  we have a whole region    in a e 
 none 	that s a whole set of discourse related cues to your middle layer  right 
 none 	yeah  exactly  and this is just   then just one 
 none 	so e  because at the end the more we um   add  you know  the more spider web ish it s going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing  it s going to get very ugly 
 none 	but with this way we could say  o_k  these are the discourse phenomena  they ra  may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the   the real hidden layer  um or the general hidden layer 
 none 	sure 
 none 	and the same we will be able to do for syntactic information  the verbs used  the object types used  modifiers 
 none 	and maybe there s a hidden layer for that  and so forth and so forth  then we have context 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  so essentially a lot of those nodes can be expanded into little bayes nets of their own 
 none 	yep 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	precisely 
 none 	so 
 none 	one thing that s kind of been bugging me when i   more i look at this is that the  
 none 	i guess  the fact that the   there s a complete separation between the observed features and in the output 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean  it makes it cleaner  but then uh   i mean 
 none 	that s true 
 none 	for instance if the discourse does   well for instance  the  discourse admission fee  node seems like it should point directly to the   or increase the probability of  enter directly  versus  going there via tourist  
 none 	what do you mean by that 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	yeah  or we could like add more  uh  sort of middle nodes  like we could add a node like do they want to enter it  which is affected by admission fee and by whether it s closed and by whether it has a door 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so it s like  
 none 	right 
 none 	there are   those are the two options  either like make an arrow directly or put a new node 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah  that makes sense 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and if it   if you do it  
 none 	if you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that   like
 none 	 so how much has it cost to enter   and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars  and then the persons says um  yeah i want to see it  
 none 	yeah  meaning  it s way out of my budget  um  
 none 	there are places in germany where it costs two hundred fifty dollars to enter 
 none 	um  nothing comes to mind 
 none 	without thinking too hard  um  maybe  yeah of course  um opera premiers 
 none 	really 
 none 	so you know 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	or   or any good old pink floyd concert 
 none 	i see 
 none 	if you want to see  the magic flute  or something 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	or maybe um  a famous restaurant  or  i don t know  there are various things that you might w  not want to eat a meal there but your own table  
 none 	the spagos of heidelberg 
 none 	i think that the h  i mean nothing beats the   the admission charge prices in japan 
 none 	so there  two hundred dollars is   is moderate for getting into a discotheque 
 none 	you know 
 none 	really 
 none 	then again  everything else is free then once you re ins  in there 
 none 	food and drink and so forth  so 
 none 	i mean 
 none 	but i  you know  i  we can   something  
 none 	somebody can have discussed the admission fee and u  the answer is s  if we   um  you know  um   still  based on that result is never going to enter that building  you know  because it s just too expensive 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	oh yeah  i think i see 
 none 	so the discourse refers to  admission fee  but it just turns out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse 
 none 	yeah  you have to have some notion of not just  
 none 	i mean there s a   there s change across several turns of discourse so
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i don t know how   if any of this was discussed   but how i  if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh  other   other discourse processing that might be happen  i mean 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what sort of discourse processing is uh   are the  
 none 	how much is built into smartkom and  
 none 	it works like this  the uh  um  
 none 	i mean 
 none 	the first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of t 
 none 	they tried to figure out the intention  right  simply by parsing it 
 none 	and this um   m  won t differentiate between all modes  yeah  but at least it ll tell us  o_k here we have something that   somebody that wants to go someplace  now it s up for us to figure out what kind of going there is   is   is happening  and um  if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything   all the information is needed  what happens is you know the parser parses it and then it s handed on to the discourse history which is  um o  one of the most elaborate   elaborate modules  it s   it s actually the   the whole memory of the entire system  that knows what   wh  who said what  which was   what was presented  it helps an  an  anaphora resolution and it   and it fills in all the structures that are omitted  so  um  because you say  o_k  how can i get to the castle 
 none 	 oh  how   how much is it   and um  yeah i would like uh   um   to g  let s do it  and so forth 
 none 	so even without an a  ana  anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened  so whenever the uh  um person is not actually rejecting what happened before  so as in
 none 	 no i really don t want to see that movie 
 none 	i d rather stay home and watch t_v  um  
 none 	what movie was selected in what cinema in what town is   is going to be sort of added into the disc  into the representations every di  at each dialogue step  by the discourse model   discourse model  yeah  that s what it s called  and  um  it does some help in the anaphora resolution and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues  so a person pointing to something on the screen  you know  the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s  on the screen so it s a   it s a rather huge   huge thing but um   um   we can sort of   it has a very clear interface  we can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn and   and the turn before that or you know how deep we want to search um   which is a question  how deep do we want to sear  you know 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um   but we should try to keep in mind that  you know  we re doing this sort of for research  so we   we should find a limit that s reasonable and not go  you know  all the way back to adam and eve 
 none 	you know  did that person ever discuss admissions fee   fees in his entire life 
 none 	and the dialogues are pretty   pretty you know concise and   anyway 
 none 	so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of  admission fee discussion  as a cue for entry  is thinking about the plans that various people might have 
 none 	like all the different sort of general schemas that they might be following
 none 	o_k  this person is um  finding out information about this thing in order to go in as a tourist or finding out how to get to this place in order to do business 
 none 	um  because then anything that s a cue for one of the steps would be slight evidence for that overall plan 
 none 	um  i don t know  they re   in   in non  in sort of more traditional a_i kinds of plan recognition things you sort of have you know  some idea at each turn of agent doing something 
 none 	 o_k  wha  what plans is this a   consistent with   and then get s  some more information and then you see
 none 	 here s a sequence that this sort of roughly fits into  
 none 	it   it might be useful here too  i   i don t know how you know you d have to figure out what knowl  what knowledge representation would work for that 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i mean the   u  u 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	it s in the   these   these   these plan schemas 
 none 	i mean there are some   some of them are extremely elaborate  you know 
 none 	 what do you need   need to buy a ticket   you know  and it   it s fifty steps  huh  just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter  you know  and   and maybe that s helpful to look at it   to look at those 
 none 	mm hmm  mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	it s amazing what human beings can do  w  when we talked uh we had the example  you know  of you being uh   a s  a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r  runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands  says
 none 	new york and you say
 none 	track seven  huh 
 none 	and it s because you know that that person actually is following  you know  
 none 	you execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps  you know  without any information other than  new york   huh  inferring everything from the context  so  works 
 none 	um  even though there is probably no train from here to new york  right 
 none 	mmm  not direct 
 none 	you d uh probably have to transfer in chicago 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but uh   it s possible 
 none 	um  no you probably have to transfer also somewhere else 
 none 	right 
 none 	is that t  san francisco  chicago 
 none 	i think  
 none 	is that possible 
 none 	one time i saw a report on trains  and i think there is a l 
 none 	i don t know if   i thought there was a line that went from somewhere  maybe it was sacramento to chicago  but there was like a california to chicago line of some sort 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i could be wrong though  it was a while ago 
 search 	the transcontinental railroad   doesn t that ring a bell  
 none 	i think it has to exist somewhere 
 none 	yeah but i don t know if it s still  
 none 	they might have blown it up 
 none 	well it never went all the way  right  i mean you always had to change trains at omaha  right 
 none 	well most of the way  uh 
 none 	one track ended there and the other one started at   five meters away from that and sort of  
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	well  you seem to know better than we do so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	has anybody ever been on an amtrak 
 none 	i have  but not transcontinentally 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i m frightened by amtrak myself 
 none 	what  why 
 none 	i just  
 none 	they seem to have a lot of accidents on the amtrak 
 none 	really 
 none 	their reputation is very bad  huh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s not maybe reality 
 none 	it s not like german trains 
 none 	like german trains are really great so 
 none 	but   you know  i don t know whether it s   which ones are safer  you know  statistically 
 none 	um  but they re faster 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	much faster  mm hmm 
 none 	and there s much more of them  yeah  they re
 none 	yeah  it s way better
 none 	yeah
 none 	i used   um amtrak quite a bit on the east coast and i was surprised 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	it was actually o_k 
 none 	you know  on boston new york  new york rhode island  whatever  boston 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i ve done that kind of thing 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  
 none 	that s a different issue 
 none 	this is going to be an interesting transcript 
 none 	i   i want to see what it does with uh  landmark iness  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	that s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	let s all say it a few more times  just kidding 
 none 	so 
 none 	it d help it figure it out 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so by the way tha  that structure that robert drew on the board was like more um  cue type based  right  here s like we re gonna segment off a bit of stuff that comes from discourse and then some of the things we re talking about here are more   you know  we mentioned maybe if they talk about um  i don t know  entering or som  you know like they might be more task based 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so i   i don t know if there   there s obviously some   m  more than one way of organizing the variables into something so 
 none 	i think that um  
 none 	what you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks  and maybe some of their conditions 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	one task is more likely you re in a hurry when you do that kind of s  doing business  and   and less in a hurry when uh   you re a tourist
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um   tourists may have   never have final destinations  you know because they are eternally traveling around so maybe what   what   what happened   what might happen is that we do get this sort of task based middle layer  and then we ll get these sub middle layers  that are more cue based 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	that feed into those 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	nah 
 none 	might be   might be a nice dichotomy of   of the world 
 none 	so  um
 create_calendar_entry 	i suggest w  to   for   to proceed with this in   in the sense that maybe  throughout this week   the three of us  will   will talk some more about maybe  segmenting off different regions   and we make up some   some toy a  observable  nodes    is that what th 
 none 	refined y  re  just refine the  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	what s the technical term 
 none 	for which 
 none 	for the uh   nodes that are observable 
 none 	the  outer layer  
 none 	just observable nodes  evidence nodes 
 none 	the features  i don t know  whatever you  
 none 	feature ma  make up some features for those  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	identify four regions  maybe make up some features for each region and uh   and uh  uh   and uh   middle layer for those 
 none 	and then these should then connect somehow to the more plan based deep space
 none 	yeah 
 none 	basically just refine some of the more general nodes 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  this is totally like   the probabilities and all are completely ad hoc  we need to look at all of them 
 none 	the  they   they will be aud  ad hoc for   for   for some time to come 
 none 	i mean but  they re even like
 none 	i mean like  close to the end we were like  uh  you know we were like uh really ad hoc 
 none 	it s a even distribution  like  whatever 
 none 	right  cuz if it s like  uh   if it s four things coming in  right 
 none 	and  say  some of them have like three possibilities and all that  so you re thinking like   like a hundred and forty four or something possible things   numbers to enter  right  so 
 none 	and   that s terrible 
 none 	some of them are completely absurd too  like   they want to enter  but it s closed  it s night time  you know there are tourists and all this weird stuff happens at the line up and you re like   confused 
 none 	that s uh  
 none 	well  
 none 	yeah  the only like possible interpretation is that they are like   come here just to rob the museum or something to that effect 
 none 	in which case you re supposed to alert the authorities  and see appropriate action 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  another thing to do  um  is also to  um   i guess to ask around people about other bayes net packages 
 find_calendar_entry 	is  srini  gonna be at the  meeting   tomorrow   do you know  
 none 	maybe 
 none 	wait  
 none 	the day after tomorrow    wednesday  
 none 	quite possibly  oh  oh  sorry  sorry   wednesday   yeah 
 none 	day after tomorrow  yeah 
 none 	maybe we can ask him about it 
 find_calendar_entry 	who s talking on  wednesday   
 none 	mmm 
 none 	i haven t  
 find_email 	j   jerry  never sent out a   sent out an email  did he  ever  
 none 	no  but he mentioned at the last meeting that someone was going to be talking  i forget who  uh 
 none 	oh  isn t ben 
 find_calendar_entry 	ben  i think it s ben actually  yeah  um  giving his job talk i think  um 
 none 	ben  then   ben 
 none 	ah 
 none 	sorry  i was just reading the screen 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so the uh  
 none 	that will be one   one thing we could do 
 create_single_reminder 	actually uh  have   um  also we can uh   start looking at the smartkom tables  and i will  
 none 	right 
 none 	i actually wanted to show that to you guys now but um 
 none 	do you want to trade 
 none 	um  no i  
 none 	i actually made a mistake because it   it fell asleep and when linux falls asleep on my machine it s   it doesn t wake up ever  so i had to reboot
 none 	oh  no 
 none 	and if i reboot without a network  i will not be able to start smartkom  because i need to have a network 
 none 	uh  
 none 	so we ll do that t  maybe uh  
 none 	but  o_k  but once you start   sart  start smartkom you can be on   you don t have to be on a network anymore  is that the deal 
 none 	yep 
 none 	ah  interesting 
 none 	why does smartkom need a network 
 none 	um   it looks up some stuff that  you know  is   is that   is in the   written by the operating system only if it   if you get a d_h_c_p request  so it   you know  my computer does not know its i_p address  you know 
 none 	ah 
 none 	you know  so 
 none 	unless it boots up with networking 
 none 	it s plugged in  yeah 
 none 	and i don t have an i_p address  they can t look up   they don t know who localhost is  and so forth and so forth 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	always fun 
 none 	but it s a  um  simple solution  we can just um  go downstairs and   and   and look at this  but maybe not today 
 none 	the other thing um  
 none 	i will   oh yeah 
 none 	o_k  i have to report um  data collection 
 none 	we interviewed fey 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	she s willing to do it  meaning be the wizard for the data collection  also maybe transcribe a little bit  if she has to  but also recruiting subjects  organizing them  and so forth 
 none 	so that looks good 
 none 	jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her  see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous  eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard 
 create_calendar_entry 	and i talked to liz about this and it looks as if friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data 
 none 	so who would be the subject of this trial run 
 none 	pardon me 
 none 	who   will there be a  
 none 	is one   is you   one of you gonna be the subject  like are you  
 none 	um liz also volunteered to be the first subject  which i think might be even better than us guys 
 none 	good 
 none 	one of us  yeah 
 none 	if we do need her for the technical stuff  then of course one of you has to sort of uh   jump in 
 none 	i like how we ve   you guys have successfully narrowed it down 
 none 	 is one of you going to be the subject   is one of you   jump in 
 none 	reference  i haven t done it yet 
 none 	well i just figured it has to be someone who s  um  familiar enough with the data to cause problems for the wizard  so we can  uh  see if they re you know good 
 none 	oh plants  e  u  someone who can plant difficult things 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean that s what we wanna check  right 
 none 	um 
 none 	well  in this case it s a p  it s a sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject  it s uh  
 none 	isn t that what it is 
 none 	yes w  we   we would like to test the wizard  but you know  if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task  or any of the set up  we get a more realistic you know  set up as  
 none 	i guess that would be reasonable 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i know  that s probably a good enough test of  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	sort of having an actively antagonistic  uh  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that might be a little unfair 
 none 	um 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i m sure if we uh    you think there s a chance we might need liz for  whatever  the technical side of things 
 none 	i m sure we can get other people around who don t know anything um  if we want another subject  you know  like i can drag ben into it or something 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	although he might cause problems but 
 none 	so  is it a experimental setup for the um  data collection totally ready   determined 
 none 	i like that   test the wizard  
 none 	i want that on a t_shirt 
 none 	um   i think it s   it s   it s   i mean   experimental setup u  on the technical issue yes  except we st 
 none 	i think we still need uh   a recording device for the wizard  just a tape recorder that s running in a room 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but um   in terms of specifying the scenario  um   uh   uh   we ve gotten a little further but um   we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard  and have the wizard partake in the ultimate sort of definition probe  
 none 	mm hmm 
 create_calendar_entry 	so   so if   if on friday it turns out that she really likes it and   and we really like her  then nothing should stop us from sitting down next week and getting all the details completely figured out 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and um  
 none 	o_k  so the ideal task um  will have whatever
 none 	i don t know how much the structure of the evolving bayes net will af  affect   like we wanna   we wanna be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that  right  in the course of the task 
 none 	mmm yea some 
 none 	well not all of them but you know 
 none 	bu  e  e  e  i m even  
 none 	this   this tango  enter  vista is sort of  itself  an ad hoc scenario 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	the   the basic u  um idea behind the uh data collection was the following 
 none 	the data we get from munich is very command line  simple linguistic stuff 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	hardly anything complicated 
 none 	no metaphors whatsoever 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	not a rich language 
 none 	so we wanted just to collect data  to get   that   that   that elicits more  uh  that elicits richer language 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and we actually did not want to constrain it too much  you know  just see what people say 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and then maybe we ll discover the phenomenon   the phenomena that we want to solve  you know  with whatever engine we   we come up with 
 none 	um 
 none 	so this   this   this is a parallel track  you know  there   they hopefully meet  but since  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so in other words this data collection is more general  it could   it could be used for not just this task 
 none 	it should tell us  you know  what kind of phenomenon could occur  it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being and the sort of differences there 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so it may get us some more information on the human machine pragmatics  um  that no one knows anything about  as of yesterday 
 none 	and uh   nothing has changed since then  so 
 none 	uh 
 none 	and secondly  now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this  and especially since um  
 none 	johno can t stop tango ing  we may actually include  you know  those   those intentions 
 none 	so now i think we should maybe have at least one navigational task with   with sort of explicit   uh not ex  it s implicit that the person wants to enter  and maybe some task where it s more or less explicit that the person wants to take a picture  or see it or something 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so that we can label it  i mean  that s how we get a corpus that we can label 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	exactly 
 none 	whereas  you know  if we d just get data we d never know what they actually wanted  we d get no cues 
 none 	yep 
 none 	alrighty 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	that was that 
 none 	so is this the official end of the meeting now 
 none 	yep 
 none 	looks like it 
 search 	so what s  economics  the fallacy  
 none 	i just randomly label things 
 none 	ma 
 none 	so that has nothing to do with economics or anything 
 none 	oh  really  o_k 
 none 	maybe we ought to switch off these things before we continue 
 none 	o_k  switching o 
 none 	time 
 none 	thanks 
 none 	are you fey  oh  hi  i think we ve met before  like  i remember talking to you about aspect or something like that at some point or other  so 
 none 	i am fey  yeah  hi 
 none 	what day is today 
 none 	a couple times yeah  that s right  yeah 
 none 	it s the uh twenty   nineteenth 
 none 	nineteenth 
 none 	and you were my g_s_i briefly  until i dropped the class 
 none 	right  right 
 none 	oh that s right 
 none 	but 
 none 	well 
 none 	no offense  like 
 none 	o_k  wh  wh  yeah  o_k  some in  some introductions are in order 
 none 	oh  o_k sorry 
 none 	getting ahead of myself 
 none 	o_k  so  um  for those who don t know   everyone knows me  this is great  um  apart from that  sort of the old gang  johno and bhaskara have been with us from   from day one and um they re engaged in   in various activities  some of which you will hear about today  ami is um our counselor and spiritual guidance and um also interested in problems concerning reference of the more complex type  and um he sits in as a interested participant and helper 
 none 	yay 
 none 	hi 
 none 	well 
 none 	oh wow 
 none 	is that a good characterization  i don t know 
 none 	u  that s pretty good  i think  yeah  thanks 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	keith is not technically one of us yet  ha ha  but um it s too late for him now  so 
 none 	not yet 
 none 	 one of us  
 none 	yeah right  i ve got the headset on after all 
 none 	um  officially i guess he will be joining us in the summer 
 none 	yes 
 none 	and um hopefully it is by   by means of keith that we will be able to get a b  a better formal and a better semantic um idea of what a construction is and um how we can make it work for us  additionally his interest um surpasses um english because it also entails german  an extra capability of speaking and writing and understanding and reading that language 
 none 	and um  is there anyone who doesn t know nancy 
 none 	i made that joke already  nancy  sadly  the  i don t know myself  joke 
 none 	do you   do you know nancy  o_k 
 none 	me 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i know nancy 
 none 	what 
 none 	you did  when 
 none 	uh before you came in 
 none 	oh 
 none 	about me or you 
 none 	man 
 none 	about me 
 none 	o_k  o_k 
 none 	you could do it about you 
 none 	well i didn t know  i didn t mean to be humor copying  but o_k  sorry 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yes  i know myself  it s o_k  it s a  
 none 	o_k  and um fey is with us as of six days ago officially  officially  but in reality already um much much longer and um um next to some   some more or less bureaucratic uh stuff with the   the data collection she s also the wizard in the data collection
 none 	officially  yeah 
 none 	of oz 
 none 	um  we re sticking with the term  wizard   o_k  and um
 none 	it s very exciting 
 none 	yes  yes 
 none 	not witch like 
 none 	wizardette 
 none 	wizard 
 none 	wizardess 
 none 	sorceress  i think  wizard uh by by popular vote um
 none 	o_k 
 none 	wizard 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	didn t take a vote  o_k 
 none 	o_k  um  why don t we get started on that subject anyways 
 find_calendar_entry 	um  so we re about to collect data and um the uh s  the following things have happened since we last met   when will  we three   meet again   and um what happened is that um   a_   there was some confusion between you and jerry with the   that leading to your talking to catherine snow  and he was uh he   he agreed completely that some  something confusing happened 
 none 	more than three of us 
 none 	um his idea was to get sort of the l  the lists of mayors of the department  the students  it   it s exactly how you interpreted it  sort of s 
 none 	the list of majors in the department 
 none 	m  m  majors  majors  o_k  mayor   something i don t know about these o_k  o_k 
 none 	ma  majors  majors   mayors  
 none 	majors 
 none 	the department has many mayors 
 send_email 	majors and um just sending  the   the little write up that we did on to those email lists  uh  
 none 	yeah  yeah  yeah 
 none 	but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so it was really
 none 	carol snow who was confused  not me and not jerry 
 none 	yep  yep  yep  o_k 
 none 	so  so  that is uh  
 none 	that s good 
 create_single_reminder 	so  i  should still  do that   
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and using the thing that you wrote up 
 none 	and  
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	wonderful 
 none 	and um we have a little description of asking peop  subjects to contact fey for you know recruiting them for our thing and um there was some confusion as to the consent form  which is basically that   that what what you just signed and since we have one already um  
 none 	right 
 none 	did jerry talk to you about maybe using our class  the students in the undergrad class that he s teaching  e 
 none 	um well he said um we   definitely  yes   however there is always more people in a   in a facul  uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else s class at the moment and one should sort of reach out and try and get them all 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  but th 
 none 	i guess it s that um people in his class cover a different set so   than the c  is the cogsci department that you were talking about  uh reaching out to  cuz we have you know people from other areas
 none 	i guess  see that s what i suggested to him  that people like   like jerry and george and et cetera just  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	advertise in their classes as well 
 none 	yeah or even i could   you know i could do the actual  
 none 	cuz i mean i   i know how to contact our students  so if there s something that you re sending out you can also s  um send me a copy  me or bhaskara could   either of us could post it to  uh is it   if it s a general solicitation that you know is just contact you then we can totally pro  post it to the news group so 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	that s generally the way it s done 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	a mailing list 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	do it  yeah 
 none 	that s  
 none 	o_k  so you ll send it or something so  
 none 	as a matter of fact  if you   if  
 create_single_reminder 	i can send it    i ll   send it   yeah  
 none 	you can send it to me  o_k 
 none 	now  i 
 none 	don t worry  we   this doesn t concern you anymore  robert  it s fine 
 find_email 	how   however i suggest that if  you    if you look at your email carefully you may think   you may find that you already have it  
 none 	oops 
 none 	already 
 none 	really 
 none 	oops 
 none 	probab 
 none 	maybe 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i don t remember getting anything 
 none 	w  we ll see  anyhow  um the uh
 none 	yeah  not only cogsci  also we will talk about linguistics and of course computer science 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um and then  secondly  we had  you may remember  um the problem with the re phrasing  that subject always re phrase sort of the task that uh we gave them  and so we had a meeting on friday talking about how to avoid that  and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the   the subject m  to really have intentions and sort of to act upon those  and um there the idea is now that next actually we   we need to hire one more person to actually do that job because it   it s getting more complicated  so if you know anyone interested in   in what i m about to describe  tell that person to   to write a mail to me or jerry soon  fast 
 none 	right 
 none 	um the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks  go shopping  um  take in uh a batch of art  um
 none 	 visit   do some sightseeing  blah blah blah blah blah  sort of analogous to what fey has started in   in   in compiling   compiling here and already   she has already gone to the trouble of   of anchoring it with specific um o  um entities and real world places you will find in heidelberg 
 none 	and um  so out of these f  s  these high level categories the subject can pick a couple  such as if   if there is a cop  uh a category in emptying your roll of film  the person can then decide
 none 	 o_k  i wanna do that at this place   sort of make up their own itinerary a  and   and tasks and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h  high level category list with them  but uh the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist s sort of schematic representation with   with symbols for the objects  and so  the person can maybe make a mental note that  ah yeah i wanted to go shopping here  and  i wanted to maybe take a picture of that  and  maybe um eat here  and then goes in and solves the task with the system  i_e fey  and um and we re gonna try out that   any questions 
 none 	so um y  you ll have those say somewhere what their intention was   so you still have the   the nice thing about having data where you know what the actual intention was 
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	but they will um  
 none 	there s nothing that says you know
 none 	 these are the things you want to do  so they ll say  well these are the things i want to do  and  
 none 	right  so they ll have a little bit more natural interaction 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	hopefully 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so they ll be given this map  which means that they won t have to like ask the system for in  for like high level information about where things are 
 none 	yeah it s a schematic tourist map  so it ll be uh i  it ll still require the   that information and
 none 	an 
 none 	it w  it doesn t have like streets on it that would allow them to figure out their way   o_k 
 none 	n  not   not   not really the street network 
 none 	nuh 
 none 	so you re just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever 
 none 	yeah a  and um the map is more a means for them to have the buildings and their names and maybe some ma  ma  major streets and their names and we want to maybe ask them  if you have   get it sort of isolated street the   the  whatever   river street   and they know that   they have decided that  yes  that s where they want to do this kind of action um that they have it with them and they can actually read them or sort of have the label for the object because it s too hard to memorize all these st  strange german names 
 none 	mm hmm 
 find_calendar_entry 	and then  we re  going to have another   we re gonna have w  another  trial run i_e the first with that new setup   tomorrow   at two  and we have a real interesting subject which is ron kay for who   those who know him  he s the founder of i_c_i   so he ll   he s around seven  seventy years old  or something 
 none 	i didn t know he was the founder  that s  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and he also approached me and he offered to help um our project and he was more thinking about some high level thinking tasks and i said  sure we need help you can come in as a subject  and he said  o_k   so that s what s gonna happen  tomorrow 
 none 	using this new   new um plan  o_k 
 none 	data 
 none 	new   new set up 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	which i ll hopefully sort of scrape together t 
 none 	but  thanks to fey  we already have sort of a nice blueprint and i can work with that 
 none 	questions  comments on that 
 none 	if not  we can move on 
 none 	no  no more questions 
 none 	so what s the s  this is what you made  fey  like so  
 none 	i m not sure i totally understand this but  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i m not sure i totally understand everything that s being talked about but i   i imagine i ll c  just catch on 
 none 	um are you familiar with   with the   with the very rough setup of the data  experiment 
 none 	so it s just based on like the materials you had about heidelberg 
 none 	based on the web site  yeah  at the  
 none 	oh o_k there s a web site and then you could like um figure out what the cate  o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	uh  this is where they re supposed to  
 none 	it s a tourist information web site  so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	talk to a machine and it breaks down and then the human comes on 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the question is just sort of how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	because what will happen then is that people repeat   repeat  or as much as they can  of that phrasing 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	um  are you worried about being able to identify  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um  the   the goals that we ve d  you guys have been talking about are this   these you know identifying which of three modes um their question uh concerns  so it s like the enter versus view  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  we   we   we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction  right  that s where the instructor  the person we are going to hire  um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things and so th  the q  first question for the subject is   so these are things  you know  we thought a tourist can do  is there anything that interests you  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and the person can say  yeah  sure sh  this is something i would do  i would go shopping  
 none 	yeah  and then we can sort of   this s  instructor can say  well  uh then you   you may want to find out how to get over here because this is where the shopping district is  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session 
 none 	no  just sort of   o_k  what   what   what would you like to buy and then um o_k there you wanna buy a whatever cuckoos clocks o_k and the  there is a store there  so the task then for that person is t  finding out how to get there  right  that s sort of what s left 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and we know that the intention is to enter because we know that the person wants to buy a cuckoos clock 
 none 	o_k  that s what i mean so like those tasks are all gonna be um unambiguous about which of the three modes  right  o_k  so  t 
 none 	hopefully 
 none 	well  so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words  uh uh
 none 	hopefully 
 none 	yes  in a sense that s exactly the   the   the idea  which is never possible in a   in a s  in a lab situation  nuh 
 none 	well  u  u  the one experiment th  that   that   that i ve read somewhere  it was   they u  used pictures 
 none 	yep 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so to   to uh actually um uh specify the   the tasks 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  but you know i  i 
 none 	we had exactly that on our list of possible way  things so we   uh i even made a sort of a silly thing how that could work  how you control you are here you   you want to know how to get someplace  and this is the place and it s a museum and you want to do some  and   and   and there s a person looking at pictures 
 none 	so  you know  this is exactly getting someplace with the intention of entering and looking at pictures 
 none 	right 
 none 	however  not only was   the common census were   among all participants of friday s meeting was it s gonna be very laborious to   to make these drawings for each different things  all the different actions  if at all possible  and also people will get caught up in the pictures  so all of a sudden we ll get descriptions of pictures in there 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	and people talking about pictures and pictorial representations and   um
 none 	hmm 
 none 	right 
 create_single_reminder 	i would s  i  would still be willing to  try it   
 none 	i mean  i  i m   i m not saying it s necessary but   but uh i  uh uh i  you might be able to combine you know text uh and   and some sort of picture and also uh i think it   it will be a good idea to show them the text and kind of chew the task and then take the test away   the   the   the   the   the text away so that they are not uh guided by   by by what you wrote  but can come up with their   with their own  
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	we will  
 none 	yeah  they will have no more linguistic matter in front of them when they enter this room 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	then i suggest we move on to the   to we have um uh the e_d_u project  let me make one more general remark  has sort of two   two side uh um actions  its um action items that we re do  dealing with  one is modifying the smartkom parser and the other one is modifying the smartkom natural language generation module  and um this is not too complicated but i m just mentioning it   put it in the framework because this is something we will talk about now 
 none 	um  i have some news from the generation  do you have news from the parser 
 none 	um  not  
 none 	by that look i  
 none 	yes  uh  i would really p  it would be better if i talked about it on friday 
 none 	o_k  yeah  wonderful  um  did you run into problems or did you run into not h  having time 
 none 	if that s o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but not   not any time part  
 none 	o_k  so that s good  that s better than running into problems 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and um i   i do have some good news for the natural language generation however  and the good news is i guess it s done 
 none 	uh  meaning that tilman becker  who does the german one  actually took out some time and already did it in english for us 
 none 	and so the version he s sending us is already producing the english that s needed to get by in version one point one 
 none 	so i take it that was similar to the   what   what we did for the parsing 
 none 	yeah  i   i   it   even though the generator is a little bit more complex and it would have been  not changing one hundred words but maybe four hundred words  but it would have been
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but this   this is i guess good news  and the uh   the time and especially bhaskara and uh   and um  
 none 	oh do i have it here 
 find_calendar_entry 	no  the time is now pretty much fixed   it s  the last week of april  until  the fourth of may  so it s  twenty sixth  through  fourth   
 none 	that  they ll be here  
 create_calendar_entry 	that they ll be here   so it s   it s extremely important that  the two of you   are also present in this town   during that time   
 none 	wait  what   what are the days 
 none 	april twenty sixth to the   may fourth 
 none 	yeah  something like that 
 none 	i ll probably be here 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s  
 none 	you will be here 
 find_calendar_entry 	there is a d   isn t  finals  coming up then pretty much  after that   
 none 	finals was that 
 none 	yeah w  it doesn t really have much meaning to grad students but final projects might 
 none 	yeah actually  that s true 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	that  
 none 	anyway  so this is  
 none 	well i ll be here working on something 
 none 	guaranteed  it s just uh will i be here  you know  in uh   i ll be here too actually but  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	no it s just um you know they re coming for us so that we can bug them and ask them more questions and sit down together and write sensible code and they can give some nice talks and stuff  but uh
 none 	ye 
 none 	just make a  
 none 	but it s not like we need to be with them twenty four hours a day s  for the seven days that they re here 
 none 	not   not unless you really really want to 
 none 	they re very dependent
 none 	not unless you really want to 
 none 	and they re both nice guys so you may   may want to 
 none 	o_k  that much from the parser and generator side  unless there are more questions on that 
 none 	so  no sample generator output yet 
 none 	no 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	it   just a mail that  you know  he s sending me the   the   the stuff soon and i was completely flabbergasted here and i   and that s also it s   it s going to produce the concept to speech uh blah blah blah information for   necessary for one point one in english   based on the english  you know  in english  so 
 none 	this is being sent  mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i was like  o_k  we re done  
 none 	we re done 
 none 	so that was like one of the first l  you know  the first task was getting it working for english  so that s basically over now  is that right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so the basic requirement fulfilled 
 none 	um  the basic requirement is fulfilled
 none 	almost  when
 none 	andreas stolcke and   and his gang  when they have um changed the language model of the recognizer and the dictionary  then we can actually a  put it all together and you can speak into it and ask for t_v and movie information and then when if   if something actually happens and some answers come out  then we re done 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm  so the speech recognizer also works  uh huh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	toll 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	if   and they re kind of correct  and they kind of are   are correct  it s not just like anything 
 none 	so it s not done basically 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	perhaps if the answers have something to do with the questions for example 
 none 	and they re mostly in english  so 
 none 	then um  
 none 	are they   is it using the database  the german t_v movie  o_k  so all the actual data might be german names 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um well actually th  um
 none 	or are they all like american t_v programs 
 none 	um well  
 none 	i want to see
 none 	 die dukes von hazard 
 none 	the  
 none 	o_k  so you don t know how the german dialogue   uh the german   the demo dialogue actually works  it works   the first thing is what s  you know  showing on t_v  and then the person is presented with what s running on t_v in germany on that day  on that evening and so you take one look at it and then you say  well that s really nothing   there s nothing for me there 
 none 	mm hmm  mm hmm 
 none 	 what s running in the cinemas   so maybe there s something better happening there  and then you get   you re shown what movies play which films  and it s gonna be of course all the heidelberg movies and what films they are actually showing  and most of them are going to be hollywood movies 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so   american beauty  is  american beauty   right  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	and um 
 none 	but they re shown like on a screen  it s a   i mean so would the generator  like the english language sentence of it is    these are the follow  you know the following films are being shown  or something like that 
 none 	n 
 none 	yeah  but it in that sense it doesn t make   in that case uh it doesn t really make sense to read them out loud  if you re displaying them 
 none 	s 
 none 	right  so it ll just display   o_k  so we don t have to worry about um  
 none 	but uh it ll tell you that this is what s showing in heidelberg and there you go  and the presentation agent will go  hhh   nuh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	like that   the avatar  and um 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and then you pick   pick a movie and   and   and it show  shows you the times and you pick a time and you pick seats and all of this  so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	pretty straightforward 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but it s   so this time we   we are at an advantage because it was a problem for the german system to incorporate all these english movie titles 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	nuh 
 none 	right 
 none 	but in english  that s not really a problem  unless we get some   some topical german movies that have just come out and that are in their database 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	so the person may select  huehner rennen  or whatever 
 none 	 chicken run  
 none 	o_k  then uh on to the modeling 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  yeah  i guess 
 none 	um then modeling  there it is 
 none 	o_k  what s the next thing 
 none 	yep  e 
 none 	this is very rough but this is sort of what um johno and i managed to come up with 
 none 	the idea here is that  
 none 	this is the uh s  the schema of the x_m_l here  not an example or something like that 
 none 	yeah this is not an x_m_l this is sort of towards an   a schema   nuh  definition 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	the idea is  so  imagine we have a library of schema such as the source path goal and then we have forced uh motion  we have cost action  we have a whole library of schemas 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and they re gonna be  you know  fleshed out in   in their real ugly detail  source path goal  and there s gonna be s  a lot of stuff on the goal and blah blah blah  that a goal can be and so forth 
 none 	what we think is  
 none 	and all the names could   should be taken  cum grano salis   so  this is a   the fact that we re calling this  action schema  right now should not entail that we are going to continue calling this  action schema   but what that means is we have here first of all on the   in the   in the first iteration a stupid list of source path goal actions
 none 	actions that can be categorized with   or that are related to source path goal 
 none 	wi  to that schema and we will have you know forced motion and cost action actions 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and then those actions can be in multiple categories at the same time if necessary 
 none 	so a push may be in   in   in both you know push uh in this or this uh  
 none 	forced motion and caused action for instance  o_k 
 none 	exactly  yeah  also  these things may or may not get their own structure in the future 
 none 	so this is something that  you know  may also be a res  as a result of your work in the future  we may find out that  you know  there re really s  these subtle differences between um even within the domain of entering in the light of a source path goal schema  that we need to put in   fill in additional structure up there 
 none 	but it gives us a nice handle  so with this we can basically um you know s  slaughter the cow any  anyway we want 
 none 	uh 
 none 	it   it is  
 none 	it was sort of a   it gave us some headache  how do we avoid writing down that we have sort of the enter source path goal that this  
 none 	but this sort of gets the job done in that respect and maybe it is even conceptually somewhat adequate in a sense that um we re talking about two different things  we re talking more on the sort of intention level  up there  and more on the   this is the   your basic bone um schema  down there 
 none 	uh one question  robert  when you point at the screen is it your shadow that i m supposed to look at  o_k  whereas i keep looking where your hand is  and it doesn t  
 none 	yeah  it s the shadow 
 none 	well  that wouldn t have helped you at all 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	basically  what this is   is that there s an interface between what we are doing and the action planner and right now the way the interface is
 none 	spit right here 
 none 	 action go  and then they have the   what the person claimed was the source and the person claimed as the goal passed on 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and the problem is  is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type  going into   goes of type  want to go to a place where i can take a picture of   et cetera 
 none 	so this is sort of what it looks like now  some simple  go  action from it   from an object named  peter s kirche  of the type  church  to an object named  powder tower  of the type  tower  
 none 	this is the uh   what the action planner uses  this is   o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	right  currently 
 none 	and is that   and tha  that s changeable  or not 
 none 	currently 
 none 	yeah  well  
 none 	like are we adapting to it 
 none 	or  
 none 	no  we   this is the output  sort of  of the natural language understanding  right  the input into the action planning  as it is now 
 none 	oh  yeah 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and what we are going to do  we going to   and you can see here  and again for johno please   please focus the shadow  um we re gon  uh uh here you have the action and the domain object and w  and on   on  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	what did you think he was doing 
 none 	o_k  sorry 
 none 	i just  
 none 	a laser pointer would be most appropriate here i think 
 none 	eee 
 none 	yeah i   i um have   i have no  
 none 	robert likes to be abstract and that s what i just thought he was doing 
 none 	you look up here  o_k 
 none 	sort of between here and here  so as you can see this is on one level and we are going to add another um  struct   if you want 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i_e a rich action description on that level 
 none 	so it s just an additional information  
 none 	so in the future  
 none 	exactly  in the future though  the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an   an action and a domain object but an action  a domain object  and a rich action description  which is  
 none 	right  that doesn t hurt the current way 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	which   which we re abbreviating as   rad   
 none 	good 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	rad 
 none 	so um you had like an action schema and a source path goal schema  right  so how does this source path goal schema fit into the uh action schema  like is it one of the tags there 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	hmm  mm hmm 
 none 	yeah can you go back to that one 
 none 	so the source path goal schema in this case 
 none 	i ve   if i understand how we described   we set this up  um cuz we ve been arguing about it all week  but uh we ll hold the   the  
 none 	well in this case it will hold the  
 none 	i mean the   the features i guess  i m not   it s hard for me to exactly s 
 none 	so basically that will store the   the object that is w  the source will store the object that we re going from  the goal will store the   the f  we ll fill those in fill those roles in  right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so the fillers of the role source 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the s  action schemas basically have extra  
 none 	see we   so those are   schemas exist because in case we need extra information instead of just making it an attribute and which   which is just one thing we   we decided to make it s own entity so that we could explode it out later on in case there is some structure that   that we need to exploit 
 none 	o_k  so th  sorry i just don t kn  um um um   this is just uh x_m_l mo  notational but um the fact that it s action schema and then sort of slash action schema that s a whole entit  that s a block  whereas source is just an attribute  is that  
 none 	that s a block  yeah 
 none 	no  no  no  source is just not spelled out here  source meaning   source will be uh will have a name  a type  maybe a dimensionality  maybe canonical uh orientation  
 none 	oh  o_k  o_k 
 none 	uh huh  uh huh 
 none 	o_k could it   it could also be blocked out then as   o_k 
 none 	yeah  the   so   yeah 
 none 	s  source it will be  you know we ll f  we know a lot about sources so we ll put all of that in source  but it s independent whether we are using the s_p_g schema in an enter  view  or approach mode  right  this is just properties of the s_p_g schema 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	we can talk about paths being the fastest  the quickest  the nicest and so forth  uh or   or   and the trajector should be coming in there as well 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and then g  the same about goals 
 none 	o_k  so i guess the question is when you actually fill one of these out  it ll be under action schema  those are  
 none 	it s gonna be one   y  you ll pick one of those for   o_k these are   this is just a layout of the possible that could go   play that role  o_k  go it  uh huh 
 none 	right 
 none 	right  so the   the   the roles will be filled in with the schema and then what actual a  action is chosen is   will be in the   in the action schema section 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	s  s 
 none 	o_k  so one question  this was   in this case it s all um clear  sort of obvious  but you can think of the enter  view and approach as each having their roles  right  the  
 none 	i mean it s   it s implicit that the person that s moving is doing entering viewing and approaching  but you know the usual thing is we have bindings between sort of   they re sort of like action specific roles and the more general source path goal specific roles 
 none 	so are we worrying about that or not for now  o_k 
 none 	yes  yes  since you bring it up now  we will worry about it  tell us more about it 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	what s that  oh i guess it  
 none 	what do you   what do you  
 none 	i   i may be just um reading this and interpreting it into my head in the way that i ve always viewed things and that   that may or may not be what you guys intended 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	but if it is  then the top block is sort of like um  you know  you have to list exactly what x_schema or in this action schema  there ll be a certain one  that has its own s  structure and maybe it has stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching  but those could include roles like the thing that you re viewing  the thing that you re entering  the thing that you re whatever  you know  that   which are   think   think of enter  view and approach as frames and they have frame specific parameters and   and roles and you can also describe them in a general way as source path goal schema and maybe there s other image schemas that you could you know add after this that you know  how do they work in terms of you know a force dynamics or how do they work in f  terms of other things  so all of those have um basically f  either specific   frame specific roles or more general frame specific roles that might have binding  so the question is are um   how to represent when things are linked in a certain way 
 none 	so very specific role names are  viewed thing    entered thing   
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm  mm hmm  mm hmm 
 none 	so we know for enter that there s container potentially involved and it s not   uh i don t know if you wanna have in the same level as the action schema s_p_g schema it   it s somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the source path goal um you know goal   uh goal i guess in this case  so uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there s identity basically between things and i di  don t know if that s something we need to invent or you know just  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the   wa  wasn t there supposed to be a link in the
 none 	right 
 none 	i don t know if this answers your question  i was just staring at this while you were talking  sorry 
 none 	it s o_k 
 none 	uh a link between the action schema  a field in the s  in the schema for the image schemas that would link us to which action schema we were supposed to use so we could  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  well that s   that s one   one thing is that we can link up  think also that um we can have one or m  as many as we want links from   from the schema up to the s  action um description of it 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	but the notion i got from nancy s idea was that we may f  find sort of concepts floating around i  in the a  action description of the action f   enter  frame up there that are  e  when you talk about the real world  actually identical to the goal of the   the s  source path goal schema  and do we have means of   of telling it within that a  and the answer is absolutely 
 none 	exactly 
 none 	right  right 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the way   we absolutely have those means that are even part of the m_ three l_ a_ a_p_i  meaning we can reference  so meaning  
 none 	oh great  s  uh huh 
 none 	great  that s exactly what is necessary 
 none 	and um  this referencing thing however is of temporary nature because sooner or later the w_ three c_ will be finished with their x_path  uh  um  specification and then it s going to be even much nicer  then we have real means of pointing at an individual instantiation of one of our elements here and link it to another one  and this not only within a document but also via documents  and   and all in a v  very easy e  homogenous framework 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	st 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so you know   happen to know how   what   what  sooner or later  means like in practice 
 none 	that s  but it s soon  so it s g  it s   the spec is there and it s gonna part of the m_ three l_ a_p   a_p_i filed by the end of this year so that this means we can start using it basically now  but this is a technical detail 
 none 	or estimated  o_k  o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so a pointer   a way to really say pointers 
 none 	basically references from the roles in the schema   the bottom schemas to the action schemas is wha  uh i m assuming 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i mean personally  i m looking even more forward to the day when we re going to have x_ forms  which l  is a form of notation where it allows you to say that if the s_p_g action up there is enter  then the goal type can never be a statue 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so you have constraints that are dependent on the c  actual s  specific filler  uh  of some attribute  uh huh 
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	w 
 none 	yeah e  exactly  um  you know this  of course  does not make sense in light of the statue of liberty  however it is uh you know sort of   these sort of things are imaginable 
 none 	right 
 none 	tsk  hhh  yeah 
 none 	or the gateway arch in st  louis  so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	s 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so um  like are you gonna have similar schemas for f_m like forced motion and caused action and stuff like you have for s_p_g 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and if so like can   are you able to enforce that you know if   if it s   if it s s_p_g action then you have that schema  if it s a forced motion then you have the other schema present in the  
 none 	um we have absolute   no  we have absolutely no means of enforcing that  so it would be considered valid if we have an s_p_g action  enter  and no s_p_g schema  but a forced action schema 
 none 	could happen 
 none 	whi  which is not bad  because i mean  that there s multiple sens  i mean that particular case  there s mult  there   there s a forced side of   of that verb as well 
 none 	hmm  it   maybe it means we had nothing to say about the source path goal 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	what s also nice  and for a  i  for me in my mind it s   it s crucially necessary  is that we can have multiple schemas and multiple action schemas in parallel 
 none 	right 
 none 	and um we started thinking about going through our bakery questions  so when i say  is there a bakery here   you know i do ultimately want our module to be able to first of all f  tell the rest of the system  hey this person actually wants to go there  and  b_   that person actually wants to buy something to eat there  nuh  and if these are two different schemas  i_e the source path goal schema of getting there and then the buying snacks schema  nuh   
 none 	would they both be listed here in   o_k  under so o  under action schema there s a list that can include both   both things 
 none 	yes 
 none 	ye  yeah  they they would   both schemas would appear  so what is the uh is   is there a  buying s  snacks  schema  what is the uh   have the buying snack schema 
 none 	right 
 none 	snack action 
 none 	that s interesting 
 none 	what 
 none 	see 
 none 	buying   buying his food  
 none 	i m sure there s a commercial event schema in there somewhere 
 none 	oop 
 none 	i  d  f 
 none 	yeah  a  commercial event  or something  yeah  so uh   so we would   we would instantiate the s_p_g schema with a source path goal blah blah blah and the buying event you know at which   however that looks like  the place f  thing to buy 
 none 	yeah i   i  
 none 	i see 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	interesting  would you say that the   like  
 none 	i mean you could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent things  but there s also this sort of like causal  well  so one is really facilitating the other and it s part of a compound action of some kind  which has structure 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	now it s technically possible that you can fit schema within schema  and schema within schemata  
 none 	uh i   i think that s nicer for a lot of reasons but might be a pain so uh  
 none 	um
 none 	well  for me it seems that uh   r 
 none 	i mean there are truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express at once  but in this case it s really like there s a purpo  means that you know f  for achieving some other purpose 
 none 	yes 
 none 	well  if i m   if i m recipient of such a message and i get a source path goal where the goal is a bakery and then i get a commercial action which takes place in a bakery  right  and   and   and they   they are obviously  via identifiers  identified to be the same thing here 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	yeah  see that   that bothers me that they re the same thing 
 none 	no  no  just the   yeah 
 none 	yeah because they re two different things one of which is l  you could think of one a sub you know pru  whatever pre condition for the second 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	right  yeah  yeah  so  so  o_k 
 none 	so there s like levels of granularity  so uh there s   there s um a single event of which they are both a part  and they re   independently they   they are events which have very different characters as far as source path goal whatever  so when you identify source path goal and whatever  there s gonna to be a desire  whatever  eating  hunger  whatever other frames you have involved  they have to match up in   in nice ways  so it seems like each of them has its own internal structure and mapping to these schemas you know from the other  
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but you know that s just  
 none 	that s just me 
 none 	like   i   i  
 none 	well 
 none 	i think we re gonna hit a lot of interesting problems and as i prefaced it this is the result of one week of arguing about it and um   and so  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	between you guys uh o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah i mean i   i still am not entirely sure that i really fully grasp the syntax of this  you know  like what  
 none 	well it s not   it s not actually a very   actually  it doesn t actually  
 none 	um it occur   it occurs to me that i mean ne  um well i should have   we should have added an ano  an x_m_l example  or some x_m_l examples and   and this is on   on a   on   on my list of things until next   next week 
 none 	right 
 none 	or the intended interpretation of this  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah that would be   that would be nice 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	it s also a question of the recursiveness and   and a hier  hierarchy um in there  do we want the schemas just blump blump blump blump 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	i mean it s   if we can actually you know get it so that we can  out of one utterance  activate more than one schema  i mean  then we re already pretty good  right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well   well you have to be careful with that uh uh thing because uh
 none 	i mean many actions presuppose some   um almost infinitely many other actions  so if you go to a bakery you have a general intention of uh not being hungry 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mayb  yeah 
 none 	you have a specific intentions to cross the traffic light to get there  you have a further specific intentions to left   to lift your right foot and so uh uh i mean y  you really have to focus on on   on and decide the level of   of abstraction that   that you aim at it kind of zero in on that  and more or less ignore the rest  unless there is some implications that   that you want to constant draw from   from sub tasks um that are relevant uh i mean but very difficult 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	m 
 none 	th 
 none 	the other thing that i just thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you re supposed to meet your friend there or som  you know so you   like being able to infer the second thing is very useful and probably often right  but having them separate  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	well the   the   the utterance was  is there a bakery around here    not
 none 	well maybe their friend said they were going to meet them in a bakery around the area 
 none 	 i want to go to a bakery  
 none 	right 
 none 	and i m  yeah   i m   i m inventing contexts which are maybe unlikely  but yeah i mean like   but it s still the case that um you could   you could override that default by giving extra information which is to me a reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of  o_k they really want to know if there s a bakery around here   which is direct 
 none 	right 
 none 	sure it   o_k  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well there   there   there should never be a hard coded uh shortcut from the bakery question to the uh double schema thing  how uh   and  as a matter of fact  when i have traveled with my friends we make these   exactly these kinds of appointments 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  exactly  it s   i met someone at the bakery you know in the victoria station t  you know train station london before  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	we o  o 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	yep 
 none 	well 
 none 	i have a question about the slot of the s_p_g action  so the enter view approach the   the   the eva um  those are fixed slots in this particular action  every action of this kind will have a choice 
 none 	it s like  
 none 	or   or   or   or will it just um uh   is it change  
 none 	every s_p_g   every s_p_g action either is an enter or a view or an approach  right  o_k 
 none 	right  right  so   so i   i mean for   for each particular action that you may want to characterize you would have some number of slots that define uh uh uh you know in some way what this action is all about  it can be either a_  b_ or c_  um 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so is it a fixed number or   or do you leave it open   it could be between one and fifteen uh   it s   it s   it s flexible 
 none 	um  the uh  
 none 	well  it sort of depends on   on if you actually write down the   the schema then you have to say it s either one of them or it can be none  or it can be any of them  however the uh   it seems to be sensible to me to r  to view them as mutually exclusive um maybe even not 
 none 	j 
 none 	do you mean within the source path goal actions  those three 
 none 	uh ye  uh uh b  i  uh i   u  i understand uh but  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and um how   how where is the end  so that s  
 none 	no  no  there   a  a  actually by i think my question is simpler than that  um is   o_k  so you have an s_p_g action and   and it has three different um uh aspects um because you can either enter a building or view it or   or approach it and touch it or something 
 none 	um now you define uh another action  it s   it s called um uh s  s_p_g_one action that has to do with writing a letter  let s say  i mean not even within this context  but a different action  um and this   uh action two would have various variable possibilities of interpreting what you would like to do 
 none 	forced action or forced motion 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and   i  in   in a way similar to either enter view approach you may want to send a letter  read a letter  or dictate a letter  let s say 
 none 	oh the   o_k uh maybe i d  
 none 	so  h 
 none 	the uh  
 none 	these actions   i don t know if i m gonna answer your question or not with this  but the categories inside of action schemas  so  s_p_g action is a category 
 none 	real  although i think what we re specifying here is this is a category where the actions  enter  view and approach  would fall into because they have a related source path goal schema in our tourist domain 
 none 	cuz viewing in a tourist domain is going up to it and   or actually going from one place to another to take a picture  in this   in a  
 none 	right 
 none 	oh  s  so it s sort of automatic derived fr  from the structure that   that is built elsewhere 
 none 	derived i don t know if i u 
 none 	this is a cate  this a category structure here  right  action schema 
 none 	right 
 none 	what are some types of action schemas  well one of the types of action schemas is source path goal action 
 none 	and what are some types of that  and an enter  a view  an approach  those are all source path goal actions 
 none 	right 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	inside of enter there will be roles that can be filled basically  so if i want to go from outside to inside then you d have the roles that need to filled  where you d have a source path goal set of roles  so you d the source would be outside and path is to the door or whatever  right 
 none 	right 
 none 	so if you wanted to have a new type of action you d create a new type of category 
 none 	then this category would   we would put it   or not necessarily   we would put a new action in the m  uh in the categories that   in which it has the um   well  every action has a set of related schemas like source path goal or force  whatever  right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	so we would put  write a letter  in the categories uh that   in which it had   it w  had uh schemas u 
 none 	there could be a communication event action or something like that and you could write it 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	exactly  schemas uh that of that type 
 none 	and then later  you know  there   the   we have a communication event action where we d define it down there as  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so there s a bit a redundancy  right  in   in which the things that go into a particular   you have categories at the top under action schema and the things that go under a particular category are um supposed to have a corresponding schema definition for that type  so i guess what s the function of having it up there too 
 none 	i mean i guess i m wondering whether   you could just have under action schema you could just sort of say whatever you know it s gonna be enter  view or approach or whatever number of things and pos  partly because you need to know somewhere that those things fall into some categories  and it may be multiple categories as you say which is um the reason why it gets a little messy um but if it has   if it s supposed to be categorized in category x_ then the corresponding schema x_ will be among the structures that   that follow  that s like  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  th  this is   this r  this is   this is more   this is probably the way that th  that s the way that seemed more intuitive to johno i guess also for a while   for no  no  no  uh we have not   we have not seen the light 
 none 	well  this is one of things we were arguing about 
 none 	o_k  sorry  you didn t tell me to  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	but now you guys have seen the light  so 
 none 	no 
 none 	i  it s easy to go back and forth isn t it  uh huh 
 none 	the   the reason  
 none 	one reason we re doing it this way is in case there s extra structure that s in the enter action that s not captured by the schemas  right 
 none 	i agree  right  right 
 none 	which is why i would think you would say enter and then just say all the things that are relevant specifically to enter  and then the things that are abstract will be in the abstract things as well  and that s why the bindings become useful 
 none 	right  but  
 none 	ri  you d like   so you re saying you could practically turn this structure inside out  or something  or    
 none 	um
 none 	no basically w 
 none 	ye  i see what you mean by that  but i   i don t if i would   i would need to have t  have that 
 none 	get   get rid of the sort of s_p_g slash something uh or the sub actions category  because what does that tell us 
 none 	right 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um and i agree that you know this is something we need to discuss  yeah 
 none 	i  in fact what you could say is for enter  you could say  here  list all the kinds of schemas that   on the category that   you know i  list all the parent categories   it s just like a frame hierarchy  right  like you have these blended frames  so you would say enter and you d say my parent frames are such and such  h  and then those are the ones that actually you then actually define and say how the roles bind to your specific roles which will probably be f  richer and fuller and have other stuff in there 
 none 	list all the parent categories 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	this sounds like a paper i ve read around here recently in terms of  
 none 	yeah it could be not a coincidence 
 none 	like i said  i m sure i m just hitting everything with a hammer that i developed  but i mean you know uh it s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i m just telling you what i think  you just hit the button and it s like  
 none 	and   i guess fr  uh
 none 	yeah i mean but there s a good question here  like  i mean uh do you   when do you need  
 none 	hhh  damn this headset 
 none 	when you this uh  eh  
 none 	metacomment 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s all recorded 
 none 	um 
 none 	 damn this project   no just kidding 
 none 	why do you  
 none 	hhh  i don t know  like  
 none 	how do i   how do i come at this question 
 none 	um 
 none 	i just don t see why you would  
 none 	i mean does th 
 none 	who uses this uh   this data structure 
 none 	you know  like  do you say  alright i m going to uh   do an s_p_g action  
 none 	and then you know somebody ne  either the computer or the user says  alright  well  i know i want to do a source path goal action so what are my choices among that   
 none 	and  oh  o_k  so i can do an enter view approach   it s not like that  right 
 none 	it s more like you say  i want to  uh   i want to do an enter   and then you re more interested in knowing what the parent categories are of that 
 none 	well only one of  
 none 	right  so that the um   the uh sort of representation that you were just talking about seems more relevant to the kinds of things you would have to do 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i d  
 none 	i 
 none 	i think i d   i m not sure if i understand your question 
 none 	only one of those things are gonna be lit up when we pass this on 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so only enter will be   if we   if our   if our module decided that enter is the case 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	view and approach will not be there 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well uh it s   it sort of came into my mind that sometimes even two could be on  and would be interesting  um nevertheless um l  let s   let s not  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mayb 
 none 	well in that case  we can t   we can t w  if   if   well the thing is if that s the case we   our   i don t think our system can handle that currently 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well maybe i m not understanding where this comes from and where this goes to  what are we doing with this 
 none 	no  not at all  but  
 none 	u  s  t 
 none 	in principle 
 none 	 approach and then enter  
 none 	so   the   i think the   in some sense we   we ex  get the task done extremely well because this is exactly the discussion we need   need  period  no more qualifiers than that  so  and um and   and i th  i hope um uh let s make a   a   a   a sharper claim  we will not end this discussion anytime soon 
 none 	run like this uh  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	no  this is the useful  you know  don  don t worry 
 none 	yeah  i can guarantee that 
 none 	sigh 
 none 	and it s gonna get more and more complex the   the l  complexer and larger our domains get 
 none 	and
 none 	i think um we will have all of our points in writing pretty soon  so this is nice about being being recorded also  the um  
 none 	right 
 none 	that s true 
 none 	the r  uh the   in terms of why is   it s laid out like this versus some other   um that s kind of a contentious point between the two of us but this is one wa  so this is a way to link uh the way these roles are filled out to the action 
 none 	the people  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	in my view 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	because if we know that enter is a t  is an s_p_g action  right  we know to look for an s_p_g schema and put the appropriate   fill in the appropriate roles later on 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and you could have also indicated that by saying  enter  what are the kinds of action i am  
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  so there s just like sort of reverse organization  right 
 none 	so like unless    are there reasons why one is better than the other i mean that come from other sources 
 none 	again  
 none 	yes because nobod  no  the modules don t   this is   this is a schema that defines x_m_l messages that are passed from one module to another  mainly meaning from the natural language understanding  or from the deep language understanding to the action planner 
 none 	yeah  uh
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	now the   the reason for   for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back  each module will try   have to go back to look up which uh you know entity can have which uh  you know  entity can have which parents  and then  
 none 	so you always need the whole body of   of y  your model um to figure out what belongs to what  or you always send it along with it  nuh  so you always send up  here i am   i am this person  and i can have these parents  in every message  which e 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k  so it s just like a pain to have to send it 
 none 	it may or may not be a just a pain it s   it s  
 none 	i m completely willing to   to   to throw all of this away and completely redo it  you know and   and   and it after some iterations we may just do that 
 none 	o_k  i understand 
 none 	well  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i   i would just like to ask um like  if it could happen for next time  i mean  just beca  cuz i m new and i don t really just   i just don t know what to make of this and what this is for  and stuff like that  you know  so if someone could make an example of what would actually be in it  like first of all what modules are talking to each other using this  right  and  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  we  
 create_single_reminder 	i  will promise for  the next time  to  have fleshed out n_ x_m_l examples for a   a run through and   and see how this   this then translates  and how this can come about  nuh  including the sort of  miracle occurs here  um part   
 none 	o_k 
 none 	be great 
 none 	right 
 none 	and
 none 	um
 none 	is there more to be said  i think um  
 search 	in principle what i   i think that this approach does  and e  e  whether or not we take the enter view and we all throw up   up the ladder um wha   how do how does professor peter call that     the uh hhh  silence su  sublimination  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	throwing somebody up the stairs 
 none 	have you never read the peter s principle anyone here 
 none 	nope 
 none 	oh  uh
 none 	people reach their level of uh max  their level of   at which they re incompetent or whatever 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	maximum incompetence and then you can throw them up the stairs um 
 none 	alright 
 none 	yeah  right  right 
 none 	oh 
 none 	promote them  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  so we can promote enter view all   all up a bit and and get rid of the uh blah blah x_blah uh asterisk sub action item altogether 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	no   no problem with that and we   w  we   we will play around with all of them but the principal distinction between having the   the pure schema and their instantiations on the one hand  and adding some whatever  more intention oriented specification um on parallel to that   that   this approach seems to be uh workable to me  i don t know 
 none 	if you all share that opinion then that made my day much happier 
 none 	uh yeah wait  
 none 	this is a simple way to basically link uh roles to actions 
 none 	r 
 none 	yeah  yeah  that s fine 
 none 	sure 
 none 	that s the   that was the intent of   of it  basically 
 none 	uh that s true  although um roles  
 none 	sure 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so i   i do  i m   i m not  
 none 	yeah i   i  
 none 	i m   i m never happy when he uses the word  roles   i m  
 none 	yeah  i was going to  
 none 	i b  i mean r_o_l_l_s so
 none 	oh you meant pastries  then 
 none 	bread rolls 
 none 	yeah  pastries is what i m talking about 
 none 	pastry oh ba  oh the bak  bakery example  i see 
 none 	bakery  bakery 
 none 	this is the bakery example  got it  alright 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	help 
 none 	i guess i ll agree to that  then 
 none 	o_k  that s all i have for today 
 none 	oh no  there s one more issue  bhaskara brought that one up  meeting time rescheduling 
 find_calendar_entry 	i n  didn t you say something about  friday   or    
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so it looks like you have not been partaking  the  monday   at three o clock  time has turned out to be not good anymore  
 create_calendar_entry 	so people have been thinking about an alternative time and the one we came up with is  friday   two thirty     three   what was it 
 find_calendar_entry 	you  have  class  until  two   right   so if we don t want him   if we don t want him to run over here two thirty ish or three is  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	two th 
 none 	so do i  yeah 
 none 	two thirty ish or three or friday at three or something around that time 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  yeah  e 
 none 	um how   how are your  
 none 	that would be good 
 none 	uh friday uh
 none 	yeah  that s fine 
 none 	uh  
 none 	and i know that you have until three  
 none 	you re busy 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so three is   sounds good 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i ll be free by then 
 none 	i could do that  yeah i mean earlier on friday is better but three   you know i mean   if it were a three or a three thirty time then i would take the three or whatever  but yeah sure three is fine 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  and you can always make it shortly after three probably 
 none 	i mean 
 none 	yeah  and i don t need to be here particularly deeply 
 none 	often  no  but uh  whenever  you are more than welcome if you think that this kind of discussion gets you anywhere in   in your life then uh you re free to c 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but yeah 
 none 	it s fascinating 
 none 	 that s the right answer  
 none 	i m just glad that i don t have to work it out because 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i m just glad that don t have to work it out myself  that i m not involved at all in the working out of it because 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh but you re a linguist  you should  
 none 	oh yeah  that s why i m glad that i m not involved in working it out 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so it s at friday at three  there that s
 none 	and um
 none 	so already again this week  huh 
 none 	how diligent do we feel  yeah  do feel that we have done our chores for this week or  
 none 	yeah 
 create_single_reminder 	so i mean clearly there s    i  can  talk about the um the parser changes on friday at least   so  
 add_agenda_item 	o_k   bhaskara will do the big show  on  friday   
 none 	and you guys will argue some more  and have some  probably  
 none 	yeah  between now and then 
 none 	and between now and then yeah 
 none 	promise 
 none 	we will   r 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	we will 
 none 	don t worry 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and we ll get the summary like  this   the c  you know  short version  like  
 none 	an  and i would like to second keith s request  an example wo  would be nice t  to have kind of a detailed example 
 none 	s 
 none 	yes  yes  i ve   i ve   i ve   i guess i m on record for promising that now  so um  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	like have it   we ll have it in writing  so  or  better  speech  so 
 none 	this is it and um
 find_calendar_entry 	the other good thing about it is  jerry  can be on here on  friday  and he can weigh in as well  
 create_single_reminder 	yeah   and um if  you  can  get that binding point also maybe with a nice example that would be helpful for johno and me   
 none 	oh yeah uh
 none 	o_k  let s uh yeah they re  
 none 	give us  
 none 	no problem  yeah 
 none 	i think you ve got one on hand  huh 
 none 	i have several in my head  yeah 
 none 	always thinking about binding 
 none 	well the   the   the binding is technically no problem but it s   it   for me it seems to be conceptually important that we find out if we can s  if   if there   if there are things in there that are sort of a general nature  we should distill them out and put them where the schemas are 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	if there are things that you know are intention specific  then we should put them up somewhere  a 
 none 	so  in general they ll be bindings across both intentions and the actions  so  
 none 	yep 
 none 	that s wonderful 
 none 	yeah  so it s gen  it s general across all of these things it s like  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i mean shastri would say you know binding is like an essential cognitive uh process  so  um 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so i don t think it will be isolated to one or the two  but you can definitely figure out where  
 none 	yeah  sometimes things belong and  
 none 	so actually i m not sure   i would be curious to see how separate the intention part and the action part are in the system 
 none 	like i know the whole thing is like intention lattice  or something like that  right  so is the ri  right now are the ideas the rich   rich the r_a_d or whatever is one you know potential block inside intention  it s still   it s still mainly intention hypothesis and then that s just one way to describe the   the action part of it  o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s  
 none 	it s an a  attempt to refine it basically 
 none 	and yeah  it s an   an   it s   it s sort of  
 none 	o_k  great uh huh 
 none 	not just that you want to go from here to here  it s that the action is what you intend and this action consists of all com  complicated modules and image schemas and whatever  so 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  and   and there will be a   a   a relatively high level of redundancy in the sense that um ultimately one   so th  so that if we want to get really cocky we we will say  well if you really look at it  you just need our rad   
 none 	mm hmm  which is  yeah  it s fine
 none 	you can throw the rest away  right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	because you re not gonna get anymore information out of the action a  as you find it there in the domain object 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but then again um in this case  the domain object may contain information that we don t really care about either 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so 
 none 	h 
 none 	but w  we ll see that then  and how   how it sort of evolves 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i mean if   if people really like our   our rad  i mean w  what might happen is that they will get rid of that action thing completely  you know  and leave it up for us to get the parser input um
 none 	mmm  we know the things that make use of this thing so that we can just change them so that they make use of rad 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i can t believe we re using this term  so i m like
 none 	you don t have to use the acronym 
 none 	rad  like every time i say it  it s horrible 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i see what you mean 
 none 	is the  
 none 	rad s a great term 
 none 	but what is the  why  
 none 	it s rad  even 
 none 	why 
 none 	why 
 none 	it happened to c  be what it stands for 
 none 	well  
 none 	it just happened to be the acronym 
 none 	yeah  that s   doesn t make it a great term  it s just like those jokes where you have to work on both levels  do you see what i mean  like
 none 	ye  no but i  but if you   if you   if you work in th  in that x_m_l community it is a great acronym because it e  evokes whatever r_d_f   r_d_f is the biggest thing right  that s the rich   sort of  resource description framework  and um   and also   so  description  having the word d  term  description  in there is wonderful  uh  rich  is also great  rwww 
 none 	just think of it as   as  wheel  in german 
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh  rich de  
 none 	oh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	who doesn t like to be a 
 none 	oh 
 none 	everybody likes action 
 none 	yeah  o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	plus it s hip  the kids ll like it 
 none 	but what if it s not an action 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah all the kids ll love it 
 none 	it s   it s rad  yeah 
 none 	and intentions will be   rid   
 none 	like   o_k  
 create_calendar_entry 	um are the   are the sample data that you guys showed sometime ago   like the things   maybe   maybe you re gonna run a trial tomorrow  i mean  i m just wondering whether the ac  some the actual sentences from this domain will be available  cuz it d be nice for me to like look if i m thinking about examples
 none 	i m mostly looking at child language which you know will have some overlap but not total with the kinds of things that you guys are getting  so you showed some in this   here before and maybe you ve posted it before but where would i look if i want to see 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	oh i   you want audio  or do you want transcript 
 none 	you know 
 none 	no just   just transcript 
 none 	yeah  well just transcript is just not available because nobody has transcribed it yet 
 none 	sorry 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	um i can e  i can uh i ll transcribe it though  it s no problem 
 none 	i take that back then 
 none 	o_k  well don t   don t make it a high priority   i   in fact if you just tell me like you know like two examples i mean  y 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	the   the   the representational problems are   i m sure  will be there  like enough for me to think about  so 
 none 	o_k 
 create_calendar_entry 	o_k  so  friday    whoever wants and comes  and can   
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	here  o_k 
 none 	this friday 
 none 	the big parser show 
 none 	now you can all turn off your  
 none 	how many batteries do you go through 
 none 	thank you 
 none 	alright  good 
 none 	sure 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k so  let s get started  nancy said she s coming and that means she will be 
 none 	um 
 none 	my suggestion is that robert and johno sort of give us a report on last week s adventures uh to start 
 none 	so everybody knows there were these guys f  uh from heidelber  uh  uh  actually from uh d_f_k_i uh  part of the german smartkom project  who were here for the week and  i think got a lot done 
 none 	yeah  i think so too 
 none 	um 
 none 	the   we got to the point where we can now speak into the smartkom system  and it ll go all the way through and then say something like  roman numeral one  am smarticus  
 none 	it actually says   roemisch einz  am smarticus   which means it s just using a german synthesis module for
 none 	o_k 
 none 	english sentences  so uh 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	it doesn t know  i  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um  the uh
 none 	oh   am spartacus   verstehe  o_k 
 none 	 i am sm  i am smarticus  is what it s saying  i gue 
 none 	right 
 none 	the uh synthesis is just a question of um  hopefully it s just a question of exchanging a couple of files  once we have them 
 none 	and  um  it s not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so called concept to speech approach  so i m   i m   i m going backwards now  so
 none 	 synthesis  is where you sort of make this   uh  make these sounds  and  concept to speech  is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said  and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better  presumably  then  just with text to speech 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  uh  johno learned how to write
 none 	x_m_l tags 
 none 	uh  and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some   some sentences  no  right  yeah  for a couple  
 none 	yeah  so  bu  uh  i  the way the uh  the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know  or what it wants to tell the person  to a   er in x_m_l and there s a conversion system for different uh  to go from x_m_l to something else  and th  so  the knowledge base for the system  that generates the syntasti  syntactic structures for the ge  generation is uh  in a lisp like   the knowledge base is in a lisp like form  and then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on prolog 
 none 	so  you have a   basically  a goal and it  you know  says  o_k  well i m gonna try to do the
 none 	greet the person goal  so it just starts   uh  it binds some variables and it just decides to  you know  do some subscold   basically  it just means  build the tree  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and then it passes the tree onto  uh  the ge  the generation module 
 none 	but i think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the german system can do  we ve already written the   the syntax trees for three or four 
 none 	we  yeah  so  the syntax trees are very simple  it s like most of the sentences in one tree  and instead of  you know  breaking down to  like  small units and building back up  they basically took the sentences  and basically cut them in half  or you know  into thirds or something like that  and made trees out of those 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and so uh  uh tilman wrote a little tool that you could take
 none 	lisp notation and generate an x_m_l  uh  tree 
 none 	uh 
 none 	s  what do ca  structure from the   from the lisp 
 none 	and so basically you just say  you know 
 none 	 noun goes to   you know 
 none 	er  nah  i don t re  i ve never been good at those  so there s like the v_p goes to n_ and those things in lisp  and it will generate for you 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	n_  v_ yeah  o_k 
 none 	alright 
 none 	and because we re sticking to that structure  the synthesis module doesn t need to be changed  so all that f  fancy stuff  and the texas speech version of it  which is actually the simpler version  is gonna be done in october which is much too late for us  so 
 none 	this way we   we worked around that 
 none 	the  uh   the system  um   i can show you the system  i actually want  at least  maybe  you should be able to start it on your own 
 none 	if you wanna play around with it  in th  in the future 
 none 	right now it s brittle and you need to ch  start it up and then make ts  twenty changes on   on   on   on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it  anything 
 none 	and send in a   a   a couple of side queries on some dummy center set up program so that it actually works because it s designed for this seevit thing  where you have the gestural recognition running with this s  siemens virtual touch screen  which we don t have here 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and so we re doing it via mouse  but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was   it was a lot of engineering stuff 
 none 	no science in there whatsoever  but it s working now  and um  that s the good news  so everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation 
 none 	why   i had   i did need to chan  generate different trees than the german ones  mainly because you know like uh  the gerund in   in german is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb  so i d uh have to add  am walking   or i d have to add a little stem for the  am   when i build the   built the tree 
 none 	you have to switch it on 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  i noticed that um  that some of the examples they had  had you know  non english word orders and so on  you know  and then all that good stuff  so  like 
 none 	alright 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so it might be worth  keith  you looking at this  um
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well tilman s 
 none 	i   i still don t   i still don t really understand e  like   i mean we sort of say  um  
 none 	you know  i   i still don t exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in   in this thing  or what the modules are and so on  so  you know  like just that such and such module uh um decides that it wants to achieve the goal of greeting the user  and then magically it sort of s 
 none 	yeah  
 none 	i mean  how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out  and all that 
 none 	i thi 
 create_calendar_entry 	yeah  so   i think it s not worth going over in the group  but sort of when  you  get free and you have the time uh either  robert  or  johno  or  i  can walk you through it  
 none 	r  uh sure 
 none 	yeah  soon 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together 
 none 	that s fine 
 none 	it s eee messy but once you understand it you understand it  it s   it s   there s nothing really complicated about it 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	no 
 find_calendar_entry 	and i remember one thing that   that came up in the  talk   last wednesday   
 none 	um  was this  i   i think he talked about the idea of like  um   he was talking about these lexicalized uh  uh  tree adjoining grammars where you sort of   for each word you  um   for each lexical item  the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in  and of course  that s not v 
 none 	o_k  you know how to do it 
 none 	that s the opposite of constructional  that s  you know  that s   that s h_p_s_g or whatever  you know 
 none 	right 
 none 	right  now  we re   we re not committed for our research to do any of those things  so uh we are committed for our funding 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k  to uh  
 none 	make our stuff fit to that 
 create_single_reminder 	yeah  to   n  no  to just get the dem  get the demos they need 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	o_k  so between us all we have t  to get th  the demos they need  if it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by  you know  tapping into other things we do  that s great 
 none 	you should probably move the microphone closer to your face 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but i  it turns out not to be in an  any of the contracts and  s  deliberately 
 none 	there s like a little   the twisty thing  you can move it with 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  the reason i d like you to understand uh what s going on in this demo system is not because it s important to the research  it s just for closure  so that if we come up with a question of
 none 	 could we fit this deeper stuff in there   or something  you know what the hell we  we re talking about fitting in  so it s just  uh in the sam  same actually with the rest of us we just need to really understand what s there  is there anything we can make use of 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh  is there anything we can give back  beyond th  the sort of minimum requirements 
 none 	but none of that has a short time fuse 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so th  the demo  the demo requirements for this fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something  and then   so  it s probably fifteen months or something until there s another serious demo requirement  that doesn t mean we don t think about it for fifteen months  but it means we can not think about it for six months 
 none 	oh o_k 
 none 	right 
 none 	right  yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  the plan for this summer uh  really is to step back from the applied project  keep the d  keep the context open  but actually go after the basic issues 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	oh o_k 
 none 	and  so
 none 	the idea is there s this uh  other subgroup that s worrying about formalizing the nota  getting a notation  but sort of in parallel with that  uh  the hope is tha  in particularly you will work on constructions in english ge  and german for this domain  but y  not worry about parsing them or fitting them into smartkom or any of the other   anything lik  any other constraints for the time being 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	got it 
 none 	it s hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then   and get the constructions in their form and stuff 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  i don  i don t want you f  feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints 
 none 	right  o_k 
 none 	um  and similarly with the parsing  uh we re gonna worry about parsing uh  the general case you know  construction parser for general constructions 
 none 	and  if we need a cut down version for something  or whatever  we ll worry about that later 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so i d like to  for the summer turn into science mode 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and i assume that s also  uh  your plan as well 
 none 	right 
 none 	so i mean  the   the point is that like the meetings um so far that i ve been at have been   sort of been geared towards this demo  and then that s going to go away pretty soon 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  but   but we  we re swit 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k  and then we ll sort of shift gears a 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	fairly substantially  huh 
 none 	it s got   what i   what i think is   is a good idea that i can   can show to anyone who s interested  we can even make a   sort of an internal demo  and i   i show you what i do 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i speak into it and you hear it talk  and i can sort of walk f  through the information  so  this is like in half hour or forty five minutes  just fun 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and so you   when somebody on the streets com  comes up to you and asks you what is smartkom so you can  sort of  give a sensible answer 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  c  sh  we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing 
 create_single_reminder 	just give a talk in the big room   and   and so peo  people know what s going on   when you re ready 
 none 	absolutely 
 none 	yeah i mean  that s the kind of thing   that s the level at which you know we can just li  invite everybody and say  this is a project that we ve been working on and here s a demo version of it  and stuff like that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well d  we   we do wanna have all the bugs out b  where you have to sort of pipe in extra x_m_l messages from left and right before you re  
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	indeed 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  makes sense 
 none 	but any  so that   e  e  it s clear  then  i think 
 none 	actually  roughly starting uh let s say  nex  next meeting  cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but uh starting next meeting i think we want to flip into this mode where  
 none 	uh  i mean there are a lot of issues  what s the ontology look like  you know what do the constructions look like  what s the execution engine look like  mmm lots of things 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but  more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out 
 none 	now before we do that  let s get back in   oh  but  it s still  i think  useful for you to understand the demo version enough  so that you can   can see what   what it is that   that uh it might eventually get retro fitted into or something 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  right 
 none 	and johno s already done that  uh  looked at the dem  uh the   looked at the smartkom stuff 
 none 	wa  uh  
 none 	to some de  uh what   what part of th  the smartkom stuff 
 none 	well  the parser  and that stuff 
 none 	oh yeah   yeah 
 none 	o_k  anyway  so  the trip   the report on these   the last we  we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week 
 none 	yeah  it s alright 
 none 	um 
 none 	maybe you re done  then 
 none 	well it was just amazing to   to see uh how   how instable the whole thing is  and if you just take the  
 none 	and i g  i got the feeling that we are the only ones right now who have a running system  i don t know what the guys in kaiserslautern have running because e  the version   that is  the full version that s on the server d  does not work 
 none 	and you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work  and so it s  
 none 	and even tilman and ralf sort of said  yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th  all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh october  version   so we re actually maybe ahead of the system gruppe by now  the system   the integration group 
 none 	and it was  uh   it was fun to some extent  but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that i think both ralf and tilman   um  i know that they enjoyed it here  and they r  they   they liked  uh  a lot of the stuff they saw here  what   what we have been thinking about  and they re more than willing to   to um  cooperate  by all means 
 none 	and um  part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal  group ware  server at e_m_l  make that open to all of us and them  so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and   and generating and constructions w  we   we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um  get some overlap  get some synergy out of that 
 none 	and um  the  uh   if i find someone at   in e_m_l that is interested in that  um i  
 none 	i may even think that we could look   take constructions and   and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that   that tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism  and you can just do anything with it  whether it s syntactic trees 
 none 	h_p_s_ g like stuff  or whether it s construction 
 none 	so if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there  but in the moment we re of course definitely focused on the understanding  um  pipeline 
 none 	anyth  any other uh repo  visit reports sort of stories 
 none 	uh we   so we now know
 none 	i think  what the landscape is like 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and so we just push on and   and uh  do what we need to do 
 none 	and one of the things we need to do is the um  and this i think is relatively tight   tightly constrained  is to finish up this belief net stuff  so 
 none 	uh  and i was going to switch to start talking about that unless there re m  other more general questions 
 none 	o_k so here s where we are on the belief net stuff as far as i understand it  um 
 none 	going back i guess two weeks ago uh robert had laid out this belief net  missing only the connections  right 
 none 	that is   so  he d put all th  all the dots down  and we went through this  and  i think  more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of  were in there 
 none 	yeah we may run across one or two more  but of course the connections weren t 
 none 	so  uh bhaskara and i went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh  solved you know how to do this and stuff 
 none 	and so bhaskara tracked that down  the answer seems to be uh   no  no one has done it  but yes it s a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that s what you set out to do  
 create_single_reminder 	and  so the current state of things is that  again  starting now  um we d like to actually get a running belief net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks 
 none 	so bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of june  and uh  he s gonna leave us an inheritance  which is a uh   hopefully a belief net that does these things 
 none 	and there re two aspects to it  one of which is  you know  technical  getting the coding right  and making it run  and uh stuff like that  and the other is the actual semantics 
 none 	o_k  what all   you know  what are the considerations and how  and what are the ways in which they relate 
 none 	so he doe  h  he doesn t need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we ll do that separately  but in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that  that s something that we all have to work out 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	is   is that right 
 none 	i mean that s   that s both you guys  understanding of where we are  o_k 
 none 	absolutely 
 none 	so  i guess  um   is there like a latest version of the belief net   of the proposed belief net 
 none 	like   like  
 none 	we had um decided  
 none 	um 
 none 	well  no  we didn t decide  we wanted to look into maybe getting it  the visualization  a bit clearer  but i think if we do it  um  sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then the connections between them  that should suffice 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  that should be fine 
 none 	yeah i mean  that s a separate problem  we do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff 
 none 	yeah  i  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s separable  yeah 
 none 	i did look into that  uh in terms of  you know  exploding the nodes out and down ag 
 none 	yep 
 none 	right 
 none 	javabayes does not support that 
 none 	i can imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that 
 none 	it d probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it  and i went through all the other packages on murph  kevin murphy s page  and i couldn t find the necessary mix of free and uh with the gui and  with this thing that we want 
 none 	not   not at this point 
 none 	right 
 none 	well  we can p  if it s   if we can pay   yeah  if you know it s paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that 
 none 	o_k  so   so don t view free as   as a absolute constraint 
 none 	o_k 
 create_single_reminder 	o_k  so then i ll go back and look at the ones on the list that  
 none 	o_k  and you can ask kevin 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  
 search 	yeah  the one that uh people seem to use is uh hugin or whatever  how exp  i don t think it s   is it free  because i ve seen it advertised in places so i   it seems to  
 none 	mmm 
 none 	but  
 none 	hugin  yeah that s free 
 none 	uh  it may be free to academics  like i   i don t know 
 none 	i have a co  i have a copy that i l  i downloaded  so  at one point it was free 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh but yo  i noticed people do use hugin so um 
 search 	how do you spell that 
 none 	why
 none 	h_u_g_i_n 
 send_email 	and bhaskara can give you a pointer  so then  in any case  um   but paying a lit  you know  if i  if it s uh   probably for university  it s   it s gonna be real cheap anyway 
 none 	but um  you know  if it s fifty thousand dollars we aren t gonna do it  i m mean  we have no need for that 
 send_email 	i   i also s  would suggest not to d  spend two weeks in   in   in changing the   the javabayes code  i   i will send you a pointer to a java applet that does that  it s sort of a fish eye  you   you have a node  and you click on it  and it shows you all the connections  and then if you click on something else that moves away  that goes into the middle 
 none 	no  he s not gonna do that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	and maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two 
 none 	if that doesn t work  it s not a problem we   we need to solve right now 
 none 	what i m   what my job is  i will  um  give you the input in terms of   of the internal structure  maybe node by node  or something like this  or should i collect it all and  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	doesn t matter 
 none 	um  just any like   like sort of rough representation of the entire belief net is probably best 
 none 	o_k 
 create_calendar_entry 	and um you re gonna be around   t  again  always  tuesdays and thursdays   afternoon ish  
 none 	as usual 
 none 	yeah  
 none 	or will that change 
 none 	i mean  yeah  i can   like i c  um  this week i guess um  kind of   i have a lot of projects and stuff but after that i will generally be more free  so yes  i might  
 send_email 	i can be around  and g  i mean  generally if you email me also i can be around on other days 
 none 	yeah  o_k 
 none 	yeah and this is not a crisis that   i mean  you do  e  everybody who s a student should  you know do their work  get their c  courses all in good shape and   and   and   and then we ll dig   d  dig down on this 
 none 	yeah  that s  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	no  that s good  that means i have i h  i can spend this week doing it  so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	how do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are  i know that there s an issue of how to weight the different things too  and stuff  right  i mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of  
 none 	right 
 none 	well there   there   there
 none 	it s  
 none 	there re two different things you do  one is you design and the other is you learn 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so uh what we re gonna do initially is   is do design  and  i  if you will  guess 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  uh that is you know use your best knowledge of   of the domain to uh  hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	if it s done right  and if you have data then  there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure and there are even techniques for learning the structure  although that takes a lot more data  and it s not as  and so forth and so on  so uh but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think we ll just design it 
 none 	alright 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	fo 
 none 	hopefully as time passes we ll get more and more data from heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so but this is the long run 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but to solve our problems ag  uh a mediocre design will do i think in the beginning 
 none 	yeah  that s right 
 none 	yeah  oh  and by the way  speaking of data  um  are there
 none 	i could swore   uh  i could swear i saw it sitting on someone s desk at some point  but is there a   um a transcript of any of the  sort of  initial interactions of people with the   with the system 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	cuz you know  i m still sort of itching to   to look at what   look at the stuff  and see what people are saying 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah make yourself a note  so and   and  of course keith would like the german as well as the english  so whatever you guys can get 
 none 	the german 
 none 	oh yeah  of course  german  yeah 
 none 	yeah  the y  your native language  right  you remember that one 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	that s important  yeah 
 none 	yeah  u 
 none 	so he ll get you some data 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  i mean i   i sort of um found the uh  uh the audio of some of those  and um  it kind of sounded like i didn t want to trudge through that  you know  it was just  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	strange  but 
 none 	yep 
 none 	we probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs 
 none 	oh yeah  o_k 
 none 	um  but uh that s th  but we have data in english and german already  so    transcribed  i will send you that 
 none 	o_k  yeah  i mean 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  so while we re still at this sort of top level  anything else that we oughta talk about today 
 none 	ho  how was your thingy 
 none 	oh  um 
 none 	i just wanted to  uh  s  like mention as an issue  um  you know last meeting i wasn t here because i went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff  and that was pretty interesting and you know  i mean  seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh   to what we re doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know   what s that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill   or something like that  you know  meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff so i mean  i m sure in terms of you know  people trying to state locations or  you know  all that kind of stuff  this is gonna be very relevant  so  um  now that was   the talk was about english versus japanese  um  which obviously the japanese doesn t affect us directly  except that  um  some of the construction   he d   what he talked about was that you know in english we say things like th  you know   your bike is parked across the street  and we use these prepositional phrases  you know   well  if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike   but um in   in japanese the   the more conventionalized tendency is to use a   sort of a description of
 none 	oh right 
 none 	 where one has crossed to the river  there is a tree  
 none 	um  and you know  you can actually say things like  um 
 none 	 there s a tree where one has crossed the river  but no one has ever crossed the river   or something like that 
 none 	so the idea is that this really is you know that s supposed show that s it s really fictive and so on  but um  
 none 	but the point is that that kind of construction is also used in english  you know  like  right where you start to go up the hill   or  just when you get off the train   or something like that to   uh  to indicate where something is  so we ll have to think about  
 none 	mmm 
 none 	so   how much is that used in german 
 none 	um 
 none 	the uh   well  
 none 	i wa  i was on a uh   on a   on a different sidetrack  i mean  the   the deep map project which um is undergoing some renovation at   at the moment  but this is a   a three language project  german  english  japanese 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and um  we have a uh  uh  
 none 	i have taken care that we have the   the japanese generation and stuff  and so
 none 	i looked into uh spatial description  so we can generate spatial descriptions  how to get from a_ to b_ 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and   and information on objects  in german  english  and japanese  and there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh   differences in spatial descriptions 
 none 	well  if yo  if you re interested in that  so how   how  i mean it does sort of go d  all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent  so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um 
 none 	so  where is this huge project 
 search 	it s  kleist    it s the uh  bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions  and whatever 
 none 	mm hmm 
 send_email 	well  that may be another thing that  keith  wants to  look at   
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but um  i   i think we should leave japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for   for now  but um definitely it s interesting to look at   at cross the bordered there 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	are   are you going to p  pay any attention to the relative position   of   of the direction relative   relative to the speaker 
 none 	for example  there are some differences between hebrew and english 
 none 	we can say um
 none 	 park in front of the car  as you come beh  you drive behind the car 
 none 	in hebrew it means
 none 	 park behind the car   because to follow the car is defined as it faces you 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	intrinsic  yeah 
 none 	while in english  front of the car is the absolute front of the car 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	right  so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is  o_k 
 none 	so 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  i  i  i  is german uh closer to   to e  uh  uh  uh  uh   to e  i mean uh
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i don t think it   it s related to syntax  though  so it may be entirely different 
 none 	um  as a matter of fact  
 none 	no  it s not 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um 
 none 	i think  
 none 	did you ever get to look at the   the rou  paper that i sent you on the   on that problem in english and german 
 none 	carroll  ninety three 
 none 	um 
 none 	i   there is a   a study on the differences between english and german on exactly that problem 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so it s   they actually say  the monkey in front of the car  where s the monkey  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  um  they found statistically very significant differences in english and german  so i   i   i   it might be  since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it  that   that german might be more like hebrew in that respect 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	the solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors 
 none 	that   but it wasn t   was  
 none 	that syntactic facto  factors do   do play a role there  wh  whether you re more likely  you know   to develop uh  choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i mean   it seems to me that you can get both in   in english depending o  you know  like   in front of the car  could you know   like  here s the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something s in front of the car  or whatever  i could see that  but  
 none 	absolutely 
 none 	but anyway  so you know  i mean  this was   this was a   a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on  so uh 
 send_email 	i can also give you uh  a pointer to a paper of mine which is the   the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames  so  i m the only person in the world who actually knows how it works 
 none 	alright  cool 
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh 
 none 	not really 
 none 	great  no  i ve not seen that 
 none 	it s called a  
 none 	what do you mean  um 
 none 	 reference frames   uh uh
 none 	it s   it s spatial reference frames  you actually have only  
 none 	um 
 none 	if you wanna have a  
 none 	this is usually um  
 none 	i should   there should be an  l_   though 
 none 	well actually you have   only have two choices  you can either do a two point or a three point which is you 
 none 	you re familiar with th  with the  origo   where that s the center    origo  is the center of the f  frame of reference  and then you have the reference object and the object to be localized 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	o_k  in some cases the origo is the same as the reference object 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	this was like  
 none 	so that would be  origin  in english  right 
 none 	the origin  yeah 
 none 	right
 none 	 origo  is a terminus technikus  in that sense  that s even used in the english literature   origo  
 none 	oh  o_k  i never heard it  o_k 
 none 	alright 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and um  so  this video tape is in front of me  i m the origo and i m also the reference object  those are two point 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and three point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f  shoe is behind the chair 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  reference object and   um 
 none 	no  from   from my point of view your shoe is left of the chair 
 none 	right 
 none 	you   you can actually say things like  um 
 none 	 it s behind the tree from me  or something like that  i think  in   in   in certain circumstances in english  right  as sort of  from where i m standing it would appear that   
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so 
 none 	looks a little bit like reichenbach for time 
 none 	yeah  it sounds like it  doesn t it  yeah 
 none 	it s a lot like it  um 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and then   and then here you   on this scale  you have it either be ego or allocentric 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and that s   that s basically it  so  egocentric two point  egocentric three point  or you can have allocentric 
 none 	so   as seen from the church  the town hall is right of that um  fire station   aa huh
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	it s hardly ever used but it s w 
 none 	i d love to see it if you   if you have a copy kind of   uh 
 send_email 	yeah   i see this is   this is getting into  ami s  thing  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	he s   he s very interested in that 
 none 	here
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  uh  yeah  well  why don t you just put it on the web page  there s this e_d_u   right 
 none 	me too 
 send_email 	yeah it s   or   or just   yeah  it s also all on my   my home page at e_m_l  it s called   an anatomy of a spatial description     but  i ll  send  that link   
 none 	or a link to it 
 none 	just
 none 	o_k  great 
 none 	maybe just put a link on  yeah  by the way  there   something that i didn t know until about a week ago or so  is apparently  there are separate brain areas for things within reach  and things that are out of reach 
 none 	yep  yep 
 none 	huh 
 none 	so there s   there s uh all this linguistic stuff about you know  near and far  or yon and   and so forth  so this is all   this is   there s this linguistic facts  but apparently  the   uh  here s the way the findings go 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	that  you know they do m_r_i  and   and if you re uh   got something within reach then there s one of your areas lights up  and if something s out of reach uh a different one 
 none 	but here s the   the amazing result  um  they say 
 none 	you get someone with a   with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things  so the s  typical task is subdivision  so there s a   a line on the wall over there  and you give them a laser pointer  and you say 
 none 	  where s the midpoint   and they do fine 
 none 	if you give them the line  and they have to touch it  they can t 
 none 	there s just that part of the brain isn t functioning  so they can t do that 
 none 	here s the real experiment 
 none 	the same thing on the wall  you give them a laser   where is it    they do it  give them a stick  long stick  and say  do it   they can t do it 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so there s a remapping of distant space into nearby space 
 none 	right 
 none 	so they doubled   the   the end   the end of this  
 none 	because it s within reach now 
 none 	it s not within reach and you use the within reach uh  mechanism  so i ll d  i ll dig you up this reference 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	oh  wow 
 none 	circuits 
 none 	right 
 none 	that s cool 
 none 	and so this doe  this is  uh   first of all  it explains something that i ve always wondered about and i ll do this   this test on you guys as well  so 
 none 	uh 
 none 	how 
 none 	i have had an experience  not often  but a certain number of times  when  for example  i m working with a tool  a screwdriver or something  for a long time 
 none 	i start feeling the tip directly 
 none 	not indirectly  but you actually can feel the tip  and people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that  claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of  physical sensation  of the end affector 
 none 	yeah yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what s going on at the end of the tool  yeah 
 none 	the ext  the   the   the extension  right 
 none 	huh 
 none 	what s going on at the end of the tool  or whatever 
 none 	yeah  within   huh 
 none 	the extension of   of your hand  right 
 none 	yeah  right  have you hav  y  h  had this 
 none 	the  
 none 	i   i think so  i mean i  i  it s not exactly the th  same thing  but   but s  it   it   it s getting close to that 
 none 	w  what does it feel like 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh i  it feels like your   as if your uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool  and you re feeling forces on it and so forth and   and you deal directly with it 
 none 	i once  
 none 	i   i was playing you know with those um uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it s dangerous to get close 
 none 	right  yeah   yeah   yeah  yeah 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	so you can insert your hand something and there s a correspondence between  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so i played with it  after a while  you don t feel the difference anymore 
 none 	yeah  right 
 none 	i   i mean it s kind of  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	very   kind of   you stop back and suddenly it goes away and you have to kind of work again to recapture it  but yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  right 
 none 	yeah  so anyway  so   so this was the first actual experimental evidence i d seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff 
 none 	that s cool 
 none 	and of course it makes a lovely def  uh story about why languages uh  make this distinction  of course there are behavioral differences too  things you can reach are really quite different than things you can t 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but there seems to be an actu  really deep embodied neural difference  and i  this is  um   so  in addition to the e 
 none 	this is more proximal distal 
 none 	yeah uh exactly  so in addition to e  ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place  you also apparently have this proximal distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded 
 none 	s 
 search 	well   dan montello  sort of  he   he does the uh uh   th   the cognitive map world   down in santa barbara  
 none 	and he   he always talks about these  
 none 	he   he already   well   i  probably most likely without knowing this   this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well there s   there s uh been a lot of behavioral things o  on this  but that was the first neur  neuro physiological thing i saw 
 none 	anyway yeah  so we ll   we ll look at this 
 none 	and  so  all of these issues now   are now starting to come up  so  now   we re now done with demos  we re starting to do science  right  and so these issues about uh  reference  and   spatial reference  discourse reference  uh uh uh uh all this sort of stuff  uh  deixis which is part of what you were talking about  um   so  all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so we gotta do all this  so there s that  and then there s also a set of system things that come up 
 search 	so   o_k   we re not using their system  that means we need our system   right  it   it follows  and so  uh  in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right  and the formalism and stuff  we re actually gonna build something and uh  johno is point person on the parser  analyzer  whatever that is  and we re gonna start on that in parallel with the um  the grammar stuff  but to do that we re gonna need to make some decisions like ontology  so  um   and so this is another thing where we re gonna  you know  have to get involved and make s  relatively early i think  make some decisions on uh   is there an ontology a_p_i that   that    there s a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies and we build the parser and stuff around that  or is there a particular ontology that we re gonna standardize on  and if so   for example  is there something that we can use there  i   does uh either the uh smartkom project or one of the projects at e_m_l have something that we can just p  pull out  for that  
 none 	mm hmm  yeah 
 none 	alright 
 none 	uh  so there are gonna be some   some   some things like that  which are not science but system 
 none 	but we aren t gonna ignore those cuz we re   we re not only going   the plan is not only to lay out this thing  but to actually uh build some of it 
 none 	and how much we build  and   and so forth 
 none 	i  
 none 	uh  part of it  if it works right  is wh  it looks like we re now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that nancy needs for the child language modeling 
 none 	so  it s always been out of phase but it now seems that um  there s a good shot at that  so we ve talked about it  and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing  and of course it s only w  in both cases it s only one piece of a bigger system 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but it would be nice if that piece were exactly the same piece  it was just this uh construction analyzer 
 none 	right 
 none 	and so we think   we think we have a shot at   at that 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  the for  so  to   to come full circle on that  this formalization task 
 none 	o_k  is trying to get the formalism into   into a shape where it can actually uh d 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	be of use to someone who s trying to do this  right 
 none 	well  yeah  where it actually is   is   covers the whole range of things 
 none 	and the   the   the   the thing that got mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do  and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms  it turned out  inherently not to cover the space 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and it just   it was just terribly frustrating for him  and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i  i  irreconcilable thing 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i see 
 none 	right 
 none 	and 
 none 	uh  johno is much more pragmatic 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh 
 none 	good to know 
 none 	huh 
 none 	is   this is true  is it not 
 none 	yes 
 none 	o_k  so there s you know sort of  yeah  deep  really deep  emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh  complete 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	you don t have a hidden purist streak 
 none 	oh no 
 none 	o_k  just checking 
 none 	we  well it hasn t it   it certainly hasn t been observed  in any case 
 none 	no sir 
 none 	alright 
 none 	um 
 none 	now  you do  but that s o_k 
 none 	uh  so  for   for  
 none 	cuz i don t have to implement anything 
 none 	exactly right 
 none 	i have a problem  then 
 none 	exactly 
 none 	it s   so  whether i do depends on whether i m talking to him or him probably  which meeting i m in 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah  right 
 none 	right  why   a  actually  uh  the thing is  you   you do but  th  the thing you have to im  implement is so small that  
 none 	uh 
 none 	it s o_k to be purist within that context  yes  good 
 none 	within that  yeah  and uh  it s   a  and still  i think  you know  get something done 
 none 	cool 
 none 	yay 
 none 	but to try to do something upscale and purist
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	particularly if   if um what you re purist about doesn t actually work  is real hard 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  and then the other thing is while we re doing this uh
 none 	it s possible yeah 
 none 	robert s gonna pick a piece of this space 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  uh  for his absentee thesis  i think you all know that   that you can just  in germany   almost just send in your thesis 
 none 	just a drive up  ca chuk  there you go 
 none 	um
 none 	yeah right  o_k 
 none 	the  th 
 none 	there   there s a drive in thesis uh sh  joint over in saarbruecken 
 none 	exactly  drive through  yeah 
 none 	it costs a lot  the   the amount   you put in your credit card and   as well  but  uh    but anyway  so  uh  that s um  also gotta be worked out  hopefully over the next few weeks  so that   that it becomes clear uh  what piece uh  robert wants to jump into 
 none 	and  while we re at this level  uh  there s at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project  either next week or the first of august  depending on the blandishments of microsoft  so  de 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	uh  and her name is eva 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	it really is  nobody believed th  th  that  
 none 	yeah  i thought it had to be a joke  of your part  you know like    johno made it up  i m sure   
 none 	yeah 
 none 	is this person someone who s in first year this year  or
 none 	no  first year coming  so  she s   she s now out here she s moved  and she ll be a student as of then  and probably she ll pick up from you on the belief net stuff  so sh  she ll be chasing you down and stuff like that 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k

 none 	uh 
 none 	right 
 none 	uh  against all traditions 
 none 	and actually i talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this 
 none 	uh  
 none 	someone from the class 
 none 	no  interestingly enough 
 none 	we always get these people who are not in the class  who   it s interesting 
 none 	some of th  some of them  yeah 
 none 	so anyway  uh  but uh she s another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	uh  so  um  i ve give  i ve given her some things to read 
 none 	so we ll see how this goes  oh there s yet another one of the incoming first   incoming first year graduate students who s expressed interest  so we ll see how that goes 
 none 	um  anyway  so 
 none 	i think as far as this group goes  um  it s certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief net and the ideas that are involved in that  and what are th  what are the concepts 
 none 	we ll see whether it s gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not  i m not sure  it partly depends on w  what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes 
 none 	s  so  we ll see  and then  ami  you can decide  you know  how much time you wanna put into it and uh  it  it s beginning to take shap  shape  so uh and  i think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the   your traditional questions in this light  uh keith  who s buil  building constructions  will be quite happy to uh see what  you know  you envision as the issues and the problems and um  how they might uh get reflected in constructions 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	right
 none 	sure 
 none 	i suspect that s right 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 find_calendar_entry 	i   i may have to go to switzerland for   in june or beginning of july for between two weeks and four weeks  but uh  after that or before that 
 none 	o_k  fine 
 create_single_reminder 	and  um  if it s useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at heidelberg or at the german a_i center  while you re in   in the neighborhood 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah be  uh actu  actually
 search 	i m invited to do some consulting with a bank in geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in geneva  which i forgot the name of 
 none 	yeah  yep 
 none 	e  o  do y  well  we  we re connected to uh   there s a   there s a   a very significant connection between   we ll   we ll go through this 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i_c_s_i and e_p_f_l  which is the  uh  
 none 	it s the  
 none 	fr  ge  germany s got two big technical institutes  there s one in   in
 none 	zurich 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	e_t_ h  and then there s one  the french speaking one  in lausanne 
 none 	o_k  which is uh e_p_f_ l 
 none 	oh  so in switzerland 
 create_single_reminder 	so  find out who they are associated with in geneva    probably we re connected to them 
 none 	great 
 none 	right 
 none 	great  i ll let you know 
 none 	o_k 
 send_email 	s  i ll send you email 
 none 	yeah  and so anyway we c  uh  
 create_single_reminder 	we can m  undoubtedly get  ami  uh to  give a talk at uh e_m_l  or something like that   while he s in   in uh  
 none 	hmm  uh  i   i think the one you   you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there  too 
 none 	sure  yeah 
 none 	a lot of interest  actually  either place   d_f_k_i  or uh  
 none 	yeah  so  and   and if there is a book  that you ll be building up some audience for it  and you ll get feedback from these guys  cuz they ve actually   these d_f_k_i guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	great  yeah 
 none 	so we ll set that up 
 none 	cool 
 none 	o_k  so  uh  unless we wanna start digging into the   uh the belief net and the decisions now  which would be fine  it s probably  
 none 	i   i tho  it s probably better if i come next week with the um version o_ point nine of the structure 
 create_single_reminder 	o_k   so  how about if  you two guys   between now and next week   come up with something that is partially proposal  and partially questions  saying  here s what we think we understand  here are the things we think we don t understand    
 none 	and that we as a group will try to   to finish it  what i d like to do is shoot f  for finishing all this next monday 
 none 	sure 
 none 	o_k  uh   these are the decisions    i don t think we re gonna get lots more information  it s a design problem 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you know  we  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and let s come up with a first cut at what this should look like 
 none 	and then finish it up  does that so  make sense 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and um  the   the sem  semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come 
 none 	no  i   i think i ll be done   everything by this uh   by the end of this week 
 none 	same with you  no 
 none 	nnn  this   well  i ve   i have projects  but then the   my prof  professor of one of my classes also wa  has a final that he s giving us  and he s giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  oh  is it a take home final  who s doing this 
 none 	yeah  aikin  alex  yeah 
 none 	yeah  figured  that would have been i  my guess 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	um 
 none 	but anyway  yeah 
 none 	pretty soon 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  so i guess that s
 none 	so  the seventeenth will definitely be the last day  like it or not for me 
 none 	right  right 
 open_agenda 	so let s do this  and then we  we  well there s gonna be some separate co  these guys are talking  uh we have a group on the formalization  uh nancy and johno and i are gonna talk about parsers  so there re various kinds of uh  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	of course  nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people  right  so  um  two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done 
 none 	right 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so we ll do that 
 send_email 	great   oh  the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh   ellen  and see  what she s doing because the um image schemas are going to be um  an important pa    we   we want those  right  and we want them formalized and stuff like that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	quite relevant  yeah 
 none 	yeah  oh yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 create_single_reminder 	so let me   let me make a note to do that 
 none 	o_k  yeah  i m actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer  so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh right  right right right  that s great  yeah  i   i   shweta mentioned that  although she said it s a secret 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	hi
 none 	right  no faculty 
 none 	th  the faculty aren t   faculty aren t supposed to know 
 none 	wednesday s much better for me  yeah 
 none 	but um 
 none 	i m sufficiently clueless that i count as a  
 none 	yeah  right  it s as if we didn t tell anyone at all  right 
 none 	bhaskara 
 none 	so i guess this is more or less now just to get you up to date  johno 
 none 	this is what  uh 
 none 	this is a meeting for me 
 none 	um 
 none 	eva 
 none 	bhaskara  and i did 
 none 	did you add more stuff to it  later 
 none 	um  why 
 none 	um 
 none 	i don t know 
 none 	there were  like  the   you know   and all that stuff  but 
 none 	i thought you   you said you were adding stuff but i don t know 
 none 	uh  no  this is  
 none 	um 
 none 	ha 
 none 	very nice 
 none 	um  so we thought that 
 none 	we can write up uh  an element  and   for each of the situation nodes that we observed in the bayes net 
 none 	so 
 none 	what s the situation like at the entity that is mentioned  if we know anything about it  is it under construction 
 none 	or is it on fire or something happening to it  or is it stable  and so forth  going all the way um  f  through parking 
 none 	location  hotel  car  restroom 
 none 	riots  fairs  strikes  or
 none 	disasters 
 none 	so is   this is   a situation are   is all the things which can be happening right now 
 none 	or  what is the situation type 
 none 	that s basically just specifying the   the input for the   w  what s
 none 	oh  i see y  why are you specifying it in x_m_l 
 none 	um 
 none 	just because it forces us to be specific about the values here 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and  also  i mean  this is a   what the input is going to be  right 
 none 	so  we will  uh  
 none 	this is a schema  this is  
 none 	well  yeah  i just don t know if this is th  l  what the   does   this is what java bayes takes  as a
 none 	no  because i mean if we  
 none 	bayes net spec 
 none 	i mean we re sure gonna interface to  
 none 	we re gonna get an x_m_l document from somewhere 
 none 	right  and that x_m_l document will say
 none 	 we are able to   we were able to observe that w  the element  um   of the location that the car is near   
 none 	so that s gonna be  
 none 	um 
 none 	so this is the situational context  everything in it  is that what situation is short for  shi  situational context 
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so this is just  again  a  an x_m_l schemata which defines a set of possible  uh  permissible x_m_l structures  which we view as input into the bayes net 
 none 	right 
 none 	and then we can r  uh possibly run one of them uh transformations 
 none 	that put it into the format that the bayes n  or java bayes or whatever wants 
 none 	yea  are you talking   are you talking about the   the structure 
 none 	well it  
 none 	i mean when you observe a node 
 none 	when you   when you say the input to the v  java bayes  it takes a certain format  right 
 none 	um hmm 
 none 	which i don t think is this 
 none 	although i don t know 
 none 	no  it s certainly not this 
 none 	nuh 
 none 	so you could just   couldn t you just run a  
 none 	x_s_l   yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	to convert it into the java bayes for  format 
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	that s  
 none 	that s no problem  but
 none 	i even think that  um  
 none 	i mean  once   once you have this sort of as   running as a module  
 none 	right  what you want is  
 none 	you wanna say   o_k  give me the posterior probabilities of the go there node  when this is happening  
 none 	right  when the person said this  the car is there  it s raining  and this is happening 
 none 	and with this you can specify the   what s happening in the situation  and what s happening with the user 
 none 	so we get  
 none 	after we are done  through the situation we get the user vector 
 none 	so  this is a  
 none 	so this is just a specification of all the possible inputs 
 none 	yep 
 none 	and  all the possible outputs  too 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  we have  um  for example  the  uh  go there decision node which has two elements  going there and its posterior probability  and not going there and its posterior probability 
 none 	because the output is always gonna be all the decision nodes and all the   the   a  all the posterior probabilities for all the values 
 none 	and then we would just look at the  eh  struct that we wanna look at in terms of if   if we re only asking about one of the  
 none 	so like  if i m just interested in the going there node 
 none 	i would just pull that information out of the struct that gets return  that would   that java bayes would output 
 none 	um  pretty much  yes  but
 none 	i think it s a little bit more complex 
 none 	as  if i understand it correctly  it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes 
 none 	so  when we input something  we always get the  uh  posterior probabilities for all of these  right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so there is no way of telling it t  not to tell us about the eva values 
 none 	yeah  wait i agree  that s   yeah  use   oh  uh yeah  o_k 
 none 	so   so we get this whole list of   of  um  things  and the question is what to do with it  what to hand on  how to interpret it  in a sense 
 none 	so y  you said if you    i m only interested in whether he wants to go there or not   then i just look at that node  look which one  
 none 	look at that struct in the output  right 
 none 	yep 
 none 	look at that struct in the   the output  even though
 none 	i wouldn t call it a  struct   but 
 none 	well i  well  it s an x_m_l structure that s being res  returned  right 
 none 	oh  mm hmm 
 none 	so every part of a structure is a  struct  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i just uh   i just was   abbreviated it to struct in my head  and started going with that 
 none 	that element or object 
 none 	i would say 
 none 	not a c_struct  that s not what i was trying to k  though yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and  um  the reason is   why i think it s a little bit more complex or why   why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is  
 none 	um 
 none 	so 
 none 	the  uh  
 none 	let s look at an example 
 none 	well  w  wouldn t we just take the structure that s outputted and then run another transformation on it  that would just dump the one that we wanted out 
 none 	yeah  w  we d need to prune 
 none 	right 
 none 	throw things away 
 none 	well  actually  you don t even need to do that with x_m_l  d  can t you just look at one specific  
 none 	no 
 none 	yeah  exactly  the  
 none 	xerxes allows you to say  u   just give me the value of that  and that  and that  
 none 	but  we don t really know what we re interested in before we look at the complete   at   at the overall result 
 none 	so the person said  um 
 none 	 where is x_   and so  we want to know  um  is   does he want info  o  on this  or know the location 
 none 	or does he want to go there 
 none 	let s assume this is our   our question 
 none 	sure 
 none 	nuh 
 none 	so 
 none 	um 
 none 	do this in perl 
 none 	so we get  
 none 	o_k  
 none 	let s assume this is the output 
 none 	so 
 none 	we should con  be able to conclude from that that  
 none 	i mean  it s always gonna give us a value of how likely we think i  it is that he wants to go there and doesn t want to go there  or how likely it is that he wants to get information 
 none 	but  maybe w  we should just reverse this to make it a little bit more delicate 
 none 	so  does he wanna know where it is  or does he wanna go there 
 none 	he wants to know where it is 
 none 	right 
 none 	i   i   i tend to agree  and if it s  
 none 	if  
 none 	well now  y  i mean  you could  
 none 	and i  if there s sort of a clear winner here  and  um   and this is pretty  uh  
 none 	indifferent 
 none 	then we   then we might conclude that he actually wants to just know where  uh t  uh  he does want to go there 
 none 	uh  out of curiosity  is there a reason why we wouldn t combine these three nodes  into one smaller subnet  that would just basically be the question for   we have  where is x_   is the question  right  that would just be info on or location 
 none 	based upon  
 none 	or go there  a lot of people ask that  if they actually just wanna go there 
 none 	people come up to you on campus and say   where s the library  
 none 	you re gonna say   y  you re gonna say  g   go down that way  
 none 	you re not gonna say  it s   it s five hundred yards away from you  or  it s north of you   or  
 none 	 it s located   
 none 	well  i mean   but the   there s   so you just have three decisions for the final node  that would link thes  these three nodes in the net together 
 none 	um 
 none 	i don t know whether i understand what you mean  but  again  in this  
 none 	given this input  we  also in some situations  may wanna postulate an opinion whether that person wants to go there now the nicest way  use a cab  or so s  wants to know it   wants to know where it is because he wants something fixed there  because he wants to visit t  it or whatever 
 none 	so  it   n  i mean   a  all i m saying is  whatever our input is  we re always gonna get the full output 
 none 	and some   some things will always be sort of too   not significant enough 
 none 	wha 
 none 	or i  or i  it ll be tight  you won t   it ll be hard to decide  but i mean  i guess   i guess the thing is  uh  this is another  smaller  case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty  which makes me think bayes net should be the way to solve these things  so if you had   if for every construction  right  you could say   well  there   here s the where is construction  
 none 	yep 
 none 	oh 
 none 	and for the where is construction  we know we need to l  look at this node  that merges these three things together as for th  to decide the response  and since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with  we could have a finite number of nodes 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	say  if we had to y  deal with arbitrary language  it wouldn t make any sense to do that  because there d be no way to generate the nodes for every possible sentence 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but since we can only deal with a finite amount of stuff  
 none 	so  basically  the idea is to f  to feed the output of that belief net into another belief net 
 none 	yeah  so basically take these three things and then put them into another belief net 
 none 	but  why   why   why only those three  why not the whol 
 none 	well  i mean  d  for the where is question 
 none 	so we d have a node for the where is question 
 none 	yeah  but we believe that all the decision nodes are   can be relevant for the where is  and the where   how do i get to or the tell me something about 
 none 	is food not allowed in here 
 none 	you can come in if you want 
 none 	yes  it is allowed 
 none 	as long as y  you re not wearing your h  your h  headphones 
 none 	alright  just a second  i ll be back 
 none 	well  i do  i   see  i don t know if this is a good idea or not  i m just throwing it out 
 none 	but uh  it seems like we could have   i mea  or uh we could put all of the  all of the r  information that could also be relevant into the where is node answer
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yep 
 none 	node thing stuff 
 none 	and uh  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i mean  
 none 	let s not forget we re gonna get some very strong input from these sub  dis  from these discourse things  right 
 none 	so 
 none 	 tell me the location of x_  
 none 	nuh 
 none 	or  where is x_ located at   nuh 
 none 	we u 
 none 	yeah  i know  but the bayes net would be able to   the weights on the   on the nodes in the bayes net would be able to do all that  wouldn t it 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	here s a k 
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh  i ll wait until you re plugged in 
 none 	oh  don t sit there  sit here 
 none 	you know how you don t like that one  it s o_k 
 none 	oh  do i not 
 none 	that s the weird one 
 none 	that s the one that s painful  that hurts  it hurts so bad 
 none 	i m h  i m happy that they re recording that 
 none 	that headphone  the headphone that you have to put on backwards  with the little   little thing   and the little   little foam block on it 
 none 	it s a painful  painful microphone 
 none 	i think it s th  called  the crown  
 none 	the crown 
 none 	what 
 none 	yeah  versus  the sony  
 none 	the crown 
 none 	is that the actual name 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	the manufacturer 
 none 	i don t see a manufacturer on it 
 none 	you w 
 none 	oh  wait  here it is  h  this thingy 
 none 	yeah  it s  the crown  
 none 	the crown of pain 
 none 	yes 
 none 	you re on line 
 none 	are you   are your mike o  is your mike on  o_k 
 none 	indeed 
 none 	so you ve been working with these guys  you know what s going on 
 none 	yes  i have 
 none 	and  i do 
 none 	yeah  alright  s  so where are we 
 none 	excellent 
 none 	we re discussing this 
 none 	i don t think it can handle french  but anyway 
 none 	so 
 none 	assume we have something coming in  a person says   where is x_    and we get a certain   we have a situation vector and a user vector and everything is fine 
 none 	an  an  and   and our   and our  
 none 	did you just sti  did you just stick the m  the   the   the microphone actually in the tea 
 none 	no 
 none 	and  um 
 none 	i m not drinking tea  what are you talking about 
 none 	oh  yeah  sorry 
 none 	let s just assume our bayes net just has three decision nodes for the time being 
 none 	these three  he wants to know something about it  he wants to know where it is  he wants to go there 
 none 	in terms of  these would be wha  how we would answer the question where is  right 
 none 	we u 
 none 	this is   i  that s what you s  it seemed like  explained it to me earlier w 
 none 	we   we re   we wanna know how to answer the question  where is x_  
 none 	yeah  but  mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	no  i can   i can do the timing node in here  too  and say  o_k  
 none 	well  yeah  but in the s  uh  let s just deal with the s  the simple case of we re not worrying about timing or anything 
 none 	we just want to know how we should answer  where is x_  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and  um 
 none 	o_k  and 
 none 	go there has two values  right   go there and not go there  let s assume those are the posterior probabilities of that 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	info on has true or false and location  so  he wants to know something about it  and he wants to know something   he wants to know where it is  has these values 
 none 	excuse me 
 none 	and  um 
 none 	oh  i see why we can t do that 
 none 	and  um  in this case we would probably all agree that he wants to go there  our belief net thinks he wants to go there  right  in the  uh  whatever  if we have something like this here  and
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	this like that and maybe here also some  
 none 	you should probably make them out of   yeah 
 none 	well  it 
 none 	something like that  then we would guess   aha  he  our belief net  has s  stronger beliefs that he wants to know where it is  than actually wants to go there  
 none 	right 
 none 	that it   doesn t this assume  though  that they re evenly weighted 
 none 	true 
 none 	like  
 none 	i guess they are evenly weighted 
 none 	the different decision nodes  you mean 
 none 	yeah  the go there  the info on  and the location 
 none 	well  d  yeah  this is making the assumption 
 none 	yes 
 none 	like  
 none 	what do you mean by  differently weighted   they don t feed into anything really anymore 
 none 	or i jus 
 none 	but i mean  why do we  
 none 	le 
 none 	if we trusted the go there node more th  much more than we trusted the other ones  then we would conclude  even in this situation  that he wanted to go there 
 none 	so  in that sense  we weight them equally right now 
 none 	o_k  makes sense  yeah 
 none 	so the  but i guess the  k  the question   that i was as  er  wondering or maybe robert was proposing to me is  
 none 	but  
 none 	how do we d  make the decision on   as to   which one to listen to 
 none 	yeah  so  the final d  decision is the combination of these three  so again  it s   it s some kind of  uh  
 none 	bayes net 
 none 	yeah  sure 
 none 	o_k so  then  the question i  so then my question is t  to you then  would be  
 none 	so is the only r  reason we can make all these smaller bayes nets  because we know we can only deal with a finite set of constructions 
 none 	cuz oth  if we re just taking arbitrary language in  we couldn t have a node for every possible question  you know 
 none 	a decision node for every possible question  you mean 
 none 	well  i   like  in the case of   yeah 
 none 	in the ca  any piece of language  we wouldn t be able to answer it with this system  b  if we just h 
 none 	cuz we wouldn t have the correct node  basically  w  what you re s  proposing is a n  where is node  right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and   and if we   and if someone   says  you know  uh  something in mandarin to the system  we d  wouldn t know which node to look at to answer that question  right 
 none 	so is  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	so  but   but if we have a finite   what 
 none 	i don t see your point  what   what   what i am thinking  or what we re about to propose here is we re always gonna get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities 
 none 	and now we need an expert system or belief net or something that interprets that  that looks at all the values and says 
 none 	 the winner is
 none 	timing  now  go there  
 none 	 uh  go there  timing  now  
 none 	or   the winner is info on 
 none 	function off  
 none 	so  he wants to know something about it  and what it does 
 none 	nuh 
 none 	uh  regardless of   of   of the input  wh  regardle 
 none 	yeah  but 
 none 	but how does the expert   but how does the expert system know   how  who  which one to declare the winner  if it doesn t know the question it is  and how that question should be answered 
 none 	based on the k  what the question was  so what the discourse  the ontology  the situation and the user model gave us  we came up with these values for these decisions 
 none 	yeah i know  but how do we weight what we get out 
 none 	as  which one i  which ones are important 
 none 	so my i  so  if we were to it with a bayes net  we d have to have a node   for every question that we knew how to deal with  that would take all of the inputs and weight them appropriately for that question 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	does that make sense 
 none 	yay  nay 
 none 	um  i mean  are you saying that  what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation  or are we just dealing with arbitrary language 
 none 	we  
 none 	is that your point 
 none 	well  no  i   i guess my question is 
 none 	is the reason that we can make a node f  or   o_k  so  lemme see if i m confused  are we going to make a node for every question  does that make sense    or not 
 none 	for every question  like  
 none 	every construction 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	i don t   not necessarily  i would think  i mean  it s not based on constructions  it s based on things like  uh  there s gonna be a node for go there or not  and there s gonna be a node for enter  view  approach 
 none 	wel 
 none 	w  o_k 
 none 	so  someone asked a question 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	how do we decide how to answer it 
 none 	well  look at   look  
 none 	face yourself with this pr  question  you get this  
 none 	you ll have   y  this is what you get 
 none 	and now you have to make a decision  what do we think 
 none 	what does this tell us 
 none 	and not knowing what was asked  and what happened  and whether the person was a tourist or a local  because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these posterior probabilities 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	what   what we need is a   just a mechanism that says 
 none 	 aha 
 none 	there is   
 none 	i just don t think a  winner take all  type of thing is the  
 none 	i mean  in general  like  we won t just have those three  right  we ll have  uh  like  many  many nodes 
 none 	yep 
 none 	so we have to  like   so that it s no longer possible to just look at the nodes themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say 
 none 	because there are interdependencies  right 
 none 	the uh  
 none 	uh  no  so if   if for example  the go there posterior possibility is so high  um  uh  w  if it s   if it has reached   reached a certain height  then all of this becomes irrelevant  so  if   even if   if the function or the history or something is scoring pretty good on the true node  true value  
 none 	wel 
 none 	i don t know about that  cuz that would suggest that   i mean  
 none 	he wants to go there and know something about it 
 none 	do they have to be mutual 
 none 	yeah  do they have to be mutually exclusive 
 none 	i think to some extent they are 
 none 	or maybe they re not 
 none 	cuz i  uh   the way you describe what they meant  they weren t mutu  uh  they didn t seem mutually exclusive to me 
 none 	well  if he doesn t want to go there  even if the enter posterior proba  so 
 none 	wel 
 none 	go there is no 
 none 	enter is high  and info on is high 
 none 	well  yeah  just out of the other three  though  that you had in the   those three nodes  the  d  they didn t seem like they were mutually exclusive 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	no  there s   no  but  
 none 	it s through the  
 none 	so th  s  so  yeah  but some   so  some things would drop out  and some things would still be important 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but i guess what s confusing me is  if we have a bayes net to deal w  another bayes net to deal with this stuff  you know  uh  is the only reason   o_k  so 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i guess  if we have a ba  another bayes net to deal with this stuff  the only r  reason we can design it is cuz we know what each question is asking 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i think that s true 
 none 	and then  so  the only reason   way we would know what question he s asking is based upon   oh  so if   let s say i had a construction parser  and i plug this in  i would know what each construction   the communicative intent of the construction was and so then i would know how to weight the nodes appropriately  in response 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so no matter what they said  if i could map it onto a where is construction 
 none 	ge 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i could say   ah  well the  the intent  here  was where is   and i could look at those 
 none 	o_k  right 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yes  i mean  sure  you do need to know   i mean  to have that kind of information 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah  i m also agreeing that a simple pru 
 none 	take the ones where we have a clear winner 
 none 	forget about the ones where it s all sort of middle ground 
 none 	prune those out and just hand over the ones where we have a winner 
 none 	yeah  because that would be the easiest way 
 none 	we just compose as an output an x_m_l mes  message that says 
 none 	 go there now  
 none 	 enter
 none 	historical information  
 none 	and not care whether that s consistent with anything 
 none 	right 
 none 	but in this case if we say    definitely he doesn t want to go there  he just wants to know where it is   or let s call this   this  look at h  
 none 	he wants to know something about the history of  so he said 
 none 	 tell me something about the history of that  
 none 	now  the e  but for some reason the endpoint approach gets a really high score  too 
 none 	we can t expect this to be sort of at o_ point three  three  three  o_ point  three  three  three  o_ point  three  three  three  right 
 none 	somebody needs to zap that 
 none 	you know 
 none 	or know  
 none 	there needs to be some knowledge that  
 none 	we  
 none 	yeah  but  the bayes net that would merge  
 none 	i just realized that i had my hand in between my mouth and my micr  er  my  and my microphone 
 none 	so then  the bayes net that would merge there  that would make the decision between go there  info on  and location  would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted  and based upon that node  then you would look at the other stuff 
 none 	yep 
 none 	i mean  it  i 
 none 	yep 
 none 	does that make sense 
 none 	yep  it s sort of one of those  that s   it s more like a decision tree  if   if you want 
 none 	you first look o  at the lowball ones  and then  
 none 	yeah  i 
 none 	yeah  i didn t intend to say that every possible   o_k 
 none 	there was a confusion there  k  i didn t intend to say every possible thing should go into the bayes net  because some of the things aren t relevant in the bayes net for a specific question 
 none 	like the endpoint is not necessarily relevant in the bayes net for where is until after you ve decided whether you wanna go there or not 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	show us the way  bhaskara 
 none 	i guess the other thing is that um  yeah  i mean  when you re asked a specific question and you don t even  
 none 	like  if you re asked a where is question  you may not even look   like  ask for the posterior probability of the  uh  e_v_a node  right 
 none 	cuz  that s what   i mean  in the bayes net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node  so  i mean  you may not even bother to compute things you don t need 
 none 	um 
 none 	aren t we always computing all 
 none 	no 
 none 	you can compute  uh  the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes  given some other nodes  but totally ignore some other nodes  also 
 none 	basically  things you ignore get marginalized over 
 none 	yeah  but that s   that s just shifting the problem 
 none 	then you would have to make a decision   o_k  if it s a where is question  which decision nodes do i query  
 none 	yeah  so you have to make  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yes 
 none 	that s un 
 none 	but i would think that s what you want to do  right 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	well  eventually  you still have to pick out which ones you look at  so it s pretty much the same problem  isn t it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah   it s   it s   it s apples and oranges  nuh 
 none 	i mean  maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance  computational time  so either you always have it compute all the posterior possibilities for all the values for all nodes  and then prune the ones you think that are irrelevant  or you just make a p  a priori estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so basically  you d have a decision tree query  go there 
 none 	if k  if that s false  query this one  if that s true  query that one  and just basically do a binary search through the    
 none 	i don t know if it would necessarily be that  uh  complicated  but  uh  
 none 	i mean  it w 
 none 	well  in the case of go there  it would be  in the case   cuz if you needed an  if y  if go there was true  you d wanna know what endpoint was  and if it was false  you d wanna d  look at either lo  income info on or history 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s true  i guess  yeah  so  in a way you would have that 
 none 	also  i m somewhat boggled by that hugin software 
 none 	o_k  why s that 
 none 	i can t figure out how to get the probabilities into it 
 none 	like  i d look at  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	it s somewha  it s boggling me 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	alright 
 none 	well  hopefully it s fixable 
 none 	ju 
 none 	oh yeah  yeah  i d  i just think i haven t figured out what   the terms in hugin mean  versus what java bayes terms are 
 none 	it s   there s a  
 none 	o_k 
 find_calendar_entry 	um  by the way  are    do we know whether  jerry  and  nancy  are coming   or    
 none 	so we can figure this out 
 none 	they should come when they re done their stuff  basically  whenever that is 
 none 	so 
 none 	what d  what do they need to do left 
 none 	um 
 none 	i guess 
 none 	jerry needs to enter marks  but i don t know if he s gonna do that now or later 
 none 	but  uh  if he s gonna enter marks  it s gonna take him awhile  i guess  and he won t be here 
 none 	and what s nancy doing 
 none 	nancy  um  she was sorta finishing up the  uh  calculation of marks and assigning of grades  but i don t know if she should be here 
 none 	well   or  she should be free after that  so   assuming she s coming to this meeting 
 none 	i don t know if she knows about it 
 find_email 	she s  on the email list  right  
 none 	is she  o_k 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	because
 create_calendar_entry 	basically  what   where we also have decided  prior to this meeting is that we would have a rerun of  the three of us  sitting together  sometime this week  again and  finish up the  uh  values of this   
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so we have  uh  
 none 	believe it or not  we have all the bottom ones here 
 none 	well  i  
 none 	you added a bunch of nodes  for    
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	we   we   we have   actually what we have is this line 
 none 	uh  what do the  uh  structures do  so the   the   the  
 none 	right 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	for instance  this location node s got two inputs  that one you  
 none 	four inputs 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	four 
 none 	those are   the bottom things are inputs  also 
 none 	oh  i see 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  that was 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	that makes a lot more sense to me now 
 none 	yep 
 none 	cuz i thought it was like  that one in
 none 	stuart s book about  you know  the  
 none 	alarm in the dog 
 none 	u  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	or the earthquake and the alarm 
 none 	sorry  yeah  i m confusing two 
 none 	yeah  there s a dog one  too  but that s in java bayes  isn t it 
 none 	right 
 none 	maybe 
 none 	but there s something about bowel problems or something with the dog 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and we have all the top ones  all the ones to which no arrows are pointing 
 none 	what we re missing are the   these  where arrows are pointing  where we re combining top ones 
 none 	so  we have to come up with values for this  and this  this  this  and so forth 
 none 	and maybe just fiddle around with it a little bit more 
 none 	and  um 
 none 	and then it s just  uh  edges  many of edges 
 none 	and  um   we  won t meet  next monday   
 none 	so 
 none 	cuz of memorial day 
 none 	yep 
 create_calendar_entry 	we ll  meet  next tuesday   i guess  
 none 	yeah 
 find_calendar_entry 	when s  jerry   leaving for   italia   
 none 	on   on friday 
 none 	which friday 
 none 	this   this friday 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh  this friday 
 none 	ugh 
 none 	this friday 
 none 	as in  four days 
 none 	yep 
 none 	or  three days 
 none 	is he   how long is he gone for 
 none 	two weeks 
 none 	italy  huh 
 none 	what s  uh   what s there 
 none 	well  it s a country 
 none 	buildings 
 none 	people 
 none 	but it s not a conference or anything  he s just visiting 
 none 	pasta 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	just visiting 
 none 	vacation 
 none 	it s a pretty nice place  in my brief  uh  encounter with it 
 none 	do you guys   oh  yeah  so  part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when   when he comes back 
 none 	um  so  
 none 	oh  i think we should disappoint him 
 none 	yeah  you   or have a finished construction parser and a working belief net  and uh  
 none 	that wouldn t be disappointing 
 none 	i think w  we should do absolutely no work for the two weeks that he s gone 
 none 	well  that s actually what i had planned  personally  i had   i   i had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guys do a lot of work  and i do nothing 
 none 	and then  i sort of   sort of bask in   in your glory 
 none 	oh  yeah  that sounds good  too 
 find_calendar_entry 	but  uh  i  do  you guys  have any  vacation  plans  because i myself am going to be  um  gone  but this is actually not really important   just this weekend we re going camping 
 none 	yeah  i m wanna be this   gone this weekend  too 
 none 	ah 
 find_calendar_entry 	but  we re all  going to be here on  tuesday  again  
 none 	looks like it 
 none 	yeah 
 create_calendar_entry 	o_k  then   let s meet   meet again  next tuesday   
 add_agenda_item 	and  um   finish up this bayes net   
 none 	and once we have finished it 
 none 	i guess we can  um   and that s going to be more just you and me  because bhaskara is doing probabilistic  recursive  structured  object oriented  uh 
 none 	killing machines 
 none 	reasoning machines 
 none 	yes 
 none 	and  um  
 none 	killing  reasoning  what s the difference 
 find_calendar_entry 	wait  so you re saying  next tuesday  is it the whole group meeting  or just us three working on it  or   or    
 none 	uh 
 none 	the whole group  
 add_agenda_item 	and  we present our results  our final  definite  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  when you were saying we need to do a re run of  like  
 none 	h  what 
 none 	what   like  just working out the rest of the  
 none 	yeah  we should do this th  the upcoming days 
 none 	this week 
 none 	so  this week  yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	when you say   the whole group   you mean the four of us  and keith 
 none 	and  ami might 
 none 	ami might be here  and it s possible that nancy ll be here 
 none 	yep 
 none 	so  yeah 
 none 	because  th  you know  once we have the belief net done  
 add_agenda_item 	you re just gonna have to explain it to me  then  on tuesday  how it s all gonna work out   
 none 	you know 
 none 	we will 
 none 	o_k  because then  once we have it sort of up and running  then we can start you know  defining the interfaces and then feed stuff into it and get stuff out of it  and then hook it up to some fake construction parser and  
 none 	that you will have in about nine months or so  yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and  um 
 create_single_reminder 	the first bad version ll be done in nine months   
 none 	yeah  i can worry about the ontology interface and you can   keith can worry about the discourse  i mean  this is pretty   um  i mean  i   i   i hope everybody uh knows that these are just going to be uh dummy values  right  where the  
 none 	which  
 none 	which ones 
 none 	s  so   so if the endpoint   if the go there is yes and no  then go there  discourse will just be fifty fifty 
 none 	right 
 none 	um  what do you mean  if the go there says no  then the go there is  
 none 	i don t get it 
 none 	i don t u  understand 
 none 	um 
 none 	like  the go there depends on all those four things 
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  what are the values of the go there  discourse 
 none 	well  it depends on the situation  if the discourse is strongly indicating that  
 none 	yeah  but  uh  we have no discourse input 
 none 	oh  i see  the d  see  uh  specifically in our situation  d_ and o_ are gonna be  uh   yeah  sure  so  whatever 
 none 	so  so far we have  
 none 	is that what the keith node is 
 none 	yep 
 none 	o_k  and you re taking it out  for now  or    
 none 	well  this is
 none 	d_  
 none 	o_k  this  i can   i can get it in here 
 none 	all the d_  s are  
 none 	i can get it in here  so th  we have the  uh  um  sk  let s   let s call it  keith johno
 none 	node  
 none 	johno 
 none 	there is an h_ somewhere printed  
 none 	there you go 
 none 	yeah  people have the same problem with my name 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oops 
 none 	and  um 
 none 	does th  th  does the h_ go b  before the a_ or after the a_ 
 none 	oh  in my name  before the a_ 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  good 
 none 	cuz you kn  when you said people have the same problem  i thought   cuz my h_ goes after the uh e  e  e  the v 
 none 	people have the inverse problem with my name 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i always have to check  every time y  i send you an email  a past email of yours  to make sure i m spelling your name correctly 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s good 
 none 	i worry about you 
 none 	i appreciate that 
 none 	but  when you abbreviate yourself as the  basman    you don t use any h_ s 
 none 	 basman   yeah  it s because of the chessplayer named michael basman  who is my hero 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	you re a geek 
 none 	it s o_ k  i 
 none 	how do you pronou 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	how do you pronounce your name 
 none 	eva 
 none 	eva 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	not eva 
 none 	what if i were   what if i were to call you eva 
 none 	i d probably still respond to it 
 none 	i ve had people call me eva  but i don t know 
 none 	no  not just eva  eva  like if i u  take the v_ and s  pronounce it like it was a german v_  
 none 	which is f_ 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um  no idea then 
 none 	voiced 
 none 	what 
 none 	it sounds like an f_  there s also an f_ in german  which is why i  
 none 	i  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well  it s just the difference between voiced and unvoiced 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	as long as that s o_ k  i mean  i might slip out and say it accidentally  that s all i m saying 
 none 	um 
 none 	that s fine 
 none 	yeah  it doesn t matter what those nodes are  anyway  because we ll just make the weights  zero  for now 
 none 	yep 
 none 	we ll make them zero for now  because it   who   who knows what they come up with  what s gonna come in there 
 none 	o_k 
 create_calendar_entry 	and  um  then should we start on thursday 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and not meet  tomorrow   
 none 	sure 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i ll send an email  make a time suggestion 
 none 	wait  maybe it s o_k  so that   that   that we can   that we have one node per construction 
 none 	cuz even in people  like  they don t know what you re talking about if you re using some sort of strange construction 
 none 	yeah  they would still c  sort of get the closest  best fit 
 none 	well  yeah  but i mean  the   uh  i mean  that s what the construction parser would do  uh  i mean  if you said something completely arbitrary  it would f  find the closest construction  right  but if you said something that was completel  er   h  theoretically the construction parser would do that  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but if you said something for which there was no construction whatsoever  n  people wouldn t have any idea what you were talking about 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	like  bus dog fried egg   i mean 
 none 	you know 
 none 	or  if even something chinese  for example 
 none 	or  something in mandarin  yeah 
 none 	or cantonese  as the case may be 
 none 	what do you think about that  bhaskara 
 none 	i mean  
 none 	well  
 none 	but how many constructions do   could we possibly have nodes for 
 none 	in this system  or in r 
 none 	no  we  like  when people do this kind of thing 
 none 	oh  when p  how many constructions do people have 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i have not the slightest idea 
 none 	is it considered to be like in   are they considered to be like very  uh  sort of s  abstract things 
 none 	every noun is a construction 
 none 	o_k  so it s like in the thousands 
 none 	the   yeah 
 none 	any   any form  meaning pair  to my understanding  is a construction 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so 
 none 	and form u  starts at the level of noun   or actually  maybe even sounds  yeah 
 none 	phoneme  yep 
 none 	and goes upwards until you get the ditransitive construction 
 none 	and then  of course  the c  i guess  maybe there can be the  
 none 	s 
 none 	can there be combinations of the dit 
 none 	discourse level constructions 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	the  giving a speech  construction 
 none 	rhetorical constructions  yeah 
 none 	yes 
 none 	but  i mean  you know  you can probably count   count the ways 
 none 	i mean 
 none 	it s probab  yeah  i would s  definitely say it s finite 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and at least in compilers  that s all that really matters  as long as your analysis is finite 
 none 	how s that  how it can be finite  again 
 none 	nah  i can t think of a way it would be infinite 
 none 	well  you can come up with new constructions 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	if the   if your   if your brain was totally non deterministic  then perhaps there s a way to get  uh  infin  an infinite number of constructions that you d have to worry about 
 none 	but  i mean  in the practical sense  it s impossible 
 none 	right  cuz if we have a fixed number of neurons    
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so the best case scenario would be the number of constructions   or  the worst case scenario is the number of constructions equals the number of neurons 
 none 	well  two to the power of the number of neurons 
 none 	right 
 none 	but still finite 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	no  wait  not necessarily  is it 
 none 	we can end the meeting  i just  
 none 	can t you use different var  different levels of activation  across  uh   lots of different neurons  to specify different values 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	um  yeah  but there s  like  a certain level of  
 none 	there s a bandwidth issue  right  yeah 
 none 	bandw  yeah  so you can t do better than something 
 none 	turn off the mikes  otherwise it gets really tough for the tr 
 none 	i  uh  had some communications with him yesterday or the day before  so  he doesn t plan on coming real soon  but he is taking sabbatical this year and so he ll probably come for six weeks at some point 
 none 	ah  so comfortable 
 none 	smooth 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	good 
 none 	i know that he s going to like  taiwan and other places to eat  so 
 none 	right 
 none 	everyone   so are your microphones on  make sure to turn the batteries   the switch on  everybody 
 none 	on  am i on  i think i m on  good  good 
 none 	yep  yep  bye 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k  great  thanks very much 
 none 	actually  
 none 	i just had one of the most frustrating meetings of my career 
 none 	it s definitely not the most frustrating meeting i ve ever had 
 none 	you a 
 none 	you re   you remember you re being recorded at this point 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  yeah  so  w  we didn t yet specify with whom  but um 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	uh  right  uh 
 none 	so that s why keith and i are going to be a little dazed for the first half m  the meeting 
 none 	huh 
 none 	yeah  i m just gonna sit here and growl 
 none 	right  yeah  i  
 none 	i   i avoided that as long as i could for you guys  but  uh  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	for which we thank you  by the way  i know you were   you were doing that  but  anyway 
 none 	are very appreciative  yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	oh yeah  how di  how d  exactly did  uh  that paper lead to anti lock brakes 
 none 	oh  i could tell you had a rough day  man 
 none 	nah 
 none 	what 
 none 	i love that story 
 none 	yeah  it s a great story 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	oh my goodness 
 none 	oh yeah  um  liz suggested we could start off by uh  doing the digits all at the same time 
 none 	what 
 none 	all at the same time  i don t know if   i would get distracted and confused  probably 
 none 	e 
 none 	really  do we have to like  synchronize 
 none 	well  i think you re supposed to   o_k  we can do this  everybody s got different digits  right 
 none 	are you being silly 
 none 	oh wait do we have t 
 none 	uh  
 none 	yep 
 none 	yeah  do we have to time them at the same time or just overlapping  
 none 	you re kidding 
 none 	no  e  yeah   the 
 none 	no  no  just   just start whenever you want 
 none 	and any rate 
 none 	alright 
 none 	well  they   they have s  they have the close talking microphones for each of us  so   yeah  there s separate channels 
 none 	yeah  that s true 
 none 	alright 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	just plug one ear 
 none 	so when i say
 none 	yeah

 none 	you lose 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k  bye  that was a great meeting 
 none 	right 
 none 	so 
 none 	alright 
 none 	now  uh  why 
 none 	just to save time 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	does matter for them 
 none 	are we gonna start all our meetings out that way from now on 
 none 	no 
 none 	oh  too bad  i kinda like it 
 none 	well  could we 
 none 	it s strangely satisfying 
 none 	yeah  it s a ritual 
 open_agenda 	are we to r  just to make sure i know what s going on  we re talking about robert s thesis proposal today   is that true 
 none 	we could 
 none 	we are 
 none 	we might 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	well  you   you had s  you said there were two things that you might wanna do  one was rehearse your i  i  talk  
 none 	is  
 none 	oh yes  and that too 
 none 	not   not rehearse  i mean  i have just not spent any time on it  so i can show you what i ve got  get your input on it  and maybe some suggestions  that would be great 
 none 	and the same is true for the proposal 
 none 	i will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains  so  um 
 none 	i don t know how much of a chance you had to actually read it because   but you could always send me comments per electronic mail and they will be incorporated 
 none 	i haven t looked at it yet  but i will 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	um  the  
 none 	it basically says  well
 none 	 this is construal   and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general  domain general rules how things are construed  and then the idea is to use ontology  situation  user  and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what in our beloved tourism domain 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	but  with a focus on
 none 	can i s 
 none 	i think i need a copy of this  yes  i  is there an extra copy around 
 none 	sorry 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	o_k  we can   we can   we can pass   pass my  uh   we can pass my extra copy around  er  actually  my only copy  now that i think about it  but  i already read half of it  so it s o_k 
 none 	uh  he sent it 
 none 	o_k  you can keep it 
 none 	alrigh 
 none 	um  i don t   i  uh   i don t need it  um  actually this is the   the newest version after your comments  and  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah  no i s  i s  i see this has got the castle in it  and stuff like that  yep 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	oh  maybe the version i didn t have that i   mine   the w  did the one you sent on the email have the  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that was the most recent one 
 none 	uh  yeah  i think so 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yep 
 none 	cuz i read halfway but i didn t see a castle thing 
 none 	i m changing this 
 none 	just so you know  but  anyway 
 find_email 	yeah  um  if  you  would have checked your email you may have received a note from  yees   asking you to send me the  uh  up to d  current formalism thing that you presented   
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh  sorry 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	sorry 
 none 	o_k  i will  o_k  o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but for this it doesn t matter  but  uh  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	we can talk about it later 
 none 	that s not even ready  so  um  o_k  go on t  to  uh  whatever 
 none 	and  
 none 	i m making changes   don t worry about that   o_k  mmm mmm 
 none 	oh  o_k  sorry  go on 
 none 	and any type of comment whether it s a spelling or a syntax or readability  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	there s only one  s_  in  interesting  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	there s only one  s_  in  interesting   on page five 
 none 	interesting 
 none 	anyway 
 create_single_reminder 	and y  uh   email any time   but most usefully before  
 none 	the twenty first i m assuming 
 none 	the twenty first 
 none 	no  this is the twenty first 
 none 	twenty ninth 
 none 	that s  
 none 	what   today s the twenty first  oh  man 
 none 	well  better hurry up then 
 none 	the twenty ninth  
 none 	before the twenty ninth  o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 find_calendar_entry 	that s when i m meeting with  wolfgang wahlster   to sell him this idea   
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 find_calendar_entry 	then  i m  also going to  present a little talk at e_m_l  about what we have done here  and so of course  i m   i m gonna start out with this slide  so the most relevant aspects of our stay here  and um  then i m asking them to imagine that they re standing somewhere in heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning   the cave forty five is a   is a well known discotheque which is certainly not open at that   that time  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	and so they re supposed to imagine that  you know  do they think the person wants to go there  or just know where it is  uh  which is probably not  uh  the case in that discotheque example  or in the bavaria example  you just want to know where it is 
 none 	and so forth  so basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it s nine   nine p_m in the evening then the discotheque question would be  for example  one that might ask for directions instead of just location 
 none 	um  and so forth and so forth  that s sort of motivating it 
 none 	then what have we done so far  we had our little bit of  um  um  smartkom stuff  that we did  um  everth 
 none 	oh  you ve got the parser done 
 none 	sorry 
 none 	that s the   not the construction parser  that s the  uh  tablet based parser  and the generation outputter 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	easy parser 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	halfway done  yeah 
 none 	that s done  you have to change those strategies  right  that s  ten words 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  i  it  you know 
 none 	maybe twelve 
 none 	twelve  o_k 
 none 	and  um  and fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak 
 none 	that s all about that  then i m going to talk about the data  you know these things about   uh  actually i have an example  probably 
 none 	two s 
 none 	where is a nightclub 
 none 	can you hear that  or should i turn the l  volume on 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	i  i can hear it 
 none 	i could hear it 
 none 	i heard it 
 none 	they might not hear it in the   well maybe they will  i don t know 
 none 	where is a nightclub 
 none 	this was an actual  um  subject  ah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	sounds like fey 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but they re   they re mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer  the   you can observe that all the time  they re trying to match their prosody onto the machine 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	oh really 
 none 	interesting 
 none 	a popular disco is the young ganz  
 none 	oh  it s pretty slow 
 none 	where is it 
 none 	yeah  you have to  
 none 	in order to get there take bus number forty two towards the  and exit at the birdband  
 none 	o_k 
 none 	wh 
 none 	the system breaking 
 none 	what is the s    oh 
 none 	hello  hello 
 none 	i m sorry  something seems to have gone wrong with our system  so  i m going to have to take over from here  what can i help you with 
 none 	uh  i m looking for the university 
 none 	o_k   i can get the address  or if you know where you are  i can tell you how to get there 
 none 	the address would be fine 
 none 	it s at the hauptstrasse and  gasse 
 none 	is that anywhere near the castle 
 none 	o_k  and so forth and so forth 
 none 	um  i will talk about our problems with the rephrasing  and how we solved it  and some preliminary observations  also  um 
 none 	i m not gonna put in the figures from liz  but i thought it would interesting to  uh  um  point out that it s basically the same 
 none 	um  as in every human human telephone conversation  and the human computer telephone conversation is of course quite d  quite different from  uh  some first  uh  observations 
 none 	then sort of feed you back to our original problem cuz  uh   how to get there  what actually is happening there today  and then maybe talk about the big picture here  e  tell a little bit   as much as i can about the n_t_l story 
 none 	i   i wa  i do wanna  um  
 none 	i m not quite sure about this  whether i should put this in  um  that  you know  you have these two sort of different ideas that are   or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works  and then  talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude 
 none 	i ll talk about monkeys in italy 
 create_single_reminder 	and  um   srini  was gonna  send me some slides  but he didn t do it  so from   but i have the paper  i can make a resume of that  and then i stole an x_schema from one of your talks i think  
 none 	oh 
 none 	i was like   where d you get that   o_k   looks familiar  
 none 	yeah  that looks familiar 
 none 	i think that s bergen  chang  something  or the other 
 none 	whatever 
 none 	uh 
 none 	um  and that s   now i m not going to bring that  so that s basically what i have  so far  and the rest is for airplanes 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so x_schemas  then  i would like to do   talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our bayes net 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	end of story 
 none 	anything i forgot that we should mention 
 none 	oh  maybe the f_m_r_i stuff  should i mention the fact that  um  we re also actually started   going to start to look at people s brains in a more direct way 
 none 	you certainly can  i mean i  y  i  you know  i don t know  
 none 	you might just wanna like  tack that on  as a comment  to something 
 none 	right  um 
 none 	 future activities  something 
 none 	well  the time to mention it  if you mention it  is when you talk about mirror neurons  then you should talk about the more recent stuff  about the kicking and  you know  the   yeah  yeah   and   that the plan is to see to what extent the   you ll get the same phenomena with stories about this  so that   and that we re planning to do this  um  which  we are 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so that s one thing  um 
 none 	depends  i mean  there is a  um  whole language learning story 
 none 	o_k  which  uh  actually  i  i  even on your five layer slide  you   you ve got an old one that   that leaves that off 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  i   i   i do have it here 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um 
 none 	and  of course  you know  the   the big picture is this bit  but  you know  it would  
 none 	right 
 none 	but i don t think i   i am capable of   of do  pulling this off and doing justice to the matter 
 none 	i mean  there is interesting stuff in her  terms of how language works  so the emergentism story would be nice to be   you know  it would be nice to tell people how   what s happening there  plus how the  uh  language learning stuff works  but  
 none 	o_k  so  so anyway  i   i agree that s not central  what you might wanna do is  um  and may not  but you might wanna   this is   rip off a bunch of the slides on the anal  there   the   there   we ve got various i  generations of slides that show language analysis  and matching to the underlying image schemas  and  um  how the construction and simulation   that ho  that whole th 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah  th  that   that s c  that comes up to the x_schema slide  so basically i m gonna steal that from nancy  one of nancy s st 
 none 	o_k  right 
 none 	o_k  i can give you a more recent   if you want   well  that might have enough 
 none 	uh  i   yeah  but i also have stuff you   trash you left over  your quals and your triple a_i 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	the quals w  the   the   the quals slides would be fine 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	you could get it out of there  or some 
 none 	which i can even email you then  you know  like there probably was a little   few changes  not a big deal 
 none 	yeah  you could steal anything you want  i don t care 
 none 	which you ve already done  obviously  so 
 none 	well  i   i don t feel bad about it at all because   because you are on the  uh  title  i mean on the   the  you re   that s   see  that s you 
 none 	sorry
 none 	no  you shouldn t 
 none 	oh  that s great  that s great  i m glad to see propagation 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	propagated 
 none 	yes  that s great 
 none 	i mean i might even mention that this work you re doing is sort of also with the m_p_i in leipzig  so 
 none 	it s   it s certainly related  um  might wanna say 
 none 	because  um  e_m_l is building up a huge thing in leipzig 
 none 	is it 
 none 	so it  
 none 	it s on biocomputation  would  
 none 	yeah  it s different  this is the  uh  d_n_a building  or someth  the double helix building 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	kind of a different level of analysis 
 none 	the   yeah it was   it turns out that if   if you have multiple billions of dollars  y  you can do all sorts of weird things  and  
 none 	wait  they re building a  building in the shape of d_n_a  is that what you said 
 none 	what 
 none 	roughly  yeah 
 none 	oh  oh boy 
 none 	including cr  cross bridges  and
 none 	o 
 none 	what 
 none 	that s brilliant 
 none 	oh my god 
 none 	hhh  oy 
 none 	you d  you really   now i  i spent   the last time i was there i spent maybe two hours hearing this story which is  um  
 none 	of what the building 
 none 	y  you definitely wanna w  don t wanna waste that money on research  you know 
 none 	right 
 none 	that s horrible 
 none 	right 
 none 	well  no  no  y  i  there s infinite money  see you th  you th  you then fill it with researchers 
 none 	and give them more money  they just want a fun place for them to   to work 
 none 	right 
 none 	right 
 none 	and everybody gets a trampoline in their office 
 none 	well  the   the offices are actually a little   the  think of um  ramps  coming out of the double helix and then you have these half domes  glass half domes  and the offices are in   in the glass half dome 
 none 	really 
 none 	alright  let s stop talking about this 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	does it exist yet 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	uh  as a model 
 none 	they are w  now building it 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	but i th 
 none 	so  yeah  i think that s   that s a good point  th  th  that the date  the  uh  a lot of the   this is interacting with  uh  people in italy but also definitely the people in leipzig and the  
 none 	the b  the combination of the biology and the leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys  yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	anyway  enough of that  let s talk about your thesis proposal 
 none 	yeah  if somebody has something to say 
 none 	yep 
 create_single_reminder 	you  might want to  uh   double check the spellings of the authors  names on your references  you had a few  uh  misspells in your slides  there    like i believe you had  jackendorf  
 none 	um 
 none 	uh  unless there s a person called  jackendorf   yeah 
 none 	no  no  no 
 none 	on that one 
 none 	but that s the only thing i noticed in there 
 none 	in the presentation 
 none 	in the presentation 
 none 	i ll probably   i c  might have   i ll probably have comments for you separately  not important   anyway 
 none 	oh  in the presentation here  i was ac  actually worried about bibtex  uh  no  that s quite possible 
 none 	yeah  that s what he was talking about 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	that s copy and paste from something 
 none 	so i did note  i  i  it looks like the  uh  metaphor didn t get in yet 
 none 	uh  it did  there is a reference to srini  
 none 	well  s  reference is one thing  the question is is there any place   oh  did you put in something about  uh  the individual  we d talked about putting in something about people had  uh   oh yeah  o_k 
 none 	metonymy and metaphor here  right 
 none 	good  i see where you have it 
 none 	so the top of the second   of pa  page two you have a sentence 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	but  what i meant is 
 none 	i think even before you give this  to wahlster  uh  you should 
 none 	unless you put it in the text  and i don t think it s there yet  about   we talked about is the  um  scalability that you get by  um  combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism  is that in there 
 none 	yeah  mmm  um 
 none 	uh  o_k  so where   where is it  cuz i ll have to take a look 
 none 	um  but i   i did not focus on that aspect but  um  
 none 	ehhh  um  it s just underneath  uh  um  that reference to metaphor  so it s the last paragraph before two  so on page two  um  the main focus  
 none 	uh  o_k 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but that s really  
 none 	that s not about that   is it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	no  it   it   it s  says it but it doesn t say   it doesn t   it d  it d  yeah  it doesn t give the punch line 
 none 	why 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	cuz let me tell the gang what i think the punch line is  because it s actually important  which is  that  the constructions  that  uh  nancy and keith and friends are doing  uh  are  in a way  quite general
 none 	but
 none 	cover only base cases  and to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things  requires this additional mechanism  of construal  and the punch line is  he claimed  that if you do this right  you can get essentially orthogonality  that if you introduce a new construction at   at the base level  it should com  uh  interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and  similarly  if you introduce a new metaphor  it should then uh  compose with all of the constructions 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and it   to the extent that that s true then   then it s a big win over anything that exists 
 none 	so does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so that  you know  for example  uh  in the metaphor case  that you have a kind of direct idea of a source  path  and goal and any metaphorical one   and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff   you can do the same grammar 
 none 	and it is the same grammar 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	but  um  the trick is that the   the way the construction s written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container 
 none 	well   trouble  isn t a container  but it gets constr  construed as a c  container 
 none 	right 
 none 	et cetera  so that s   that s where this  um 
 none 	so with construal you don t have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule 
 none 	right 
 none 	so s it s   it   it s a very big deal  i  i  in this framework  and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn t  um  i don t think  say that as clearly as it could 
 none 	no  it doesn t say it at all  no 
 none 	even though  
 none 	one could argue what   if there are basic cases  even 
 none 	i mean  it seems like nothing is context  free 
 none 	oh  nothing is context  free  but there are basic cases  that is  um  there are physical containers  there are physical paths  there   you know  et cetera 
 none 	but  walked into the cafe and ordered a drink   and  walked into the cafe and broke his nose   that s sort of  
 none 	oh  it doesn t mean that they re unambiguous  i mean  a cafe can be construed as a container  or it can be construed you know as   as a obstacle  or as some physical object  so there are multiple construals 
 none 	mmm  yeah 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	and in fact that s part of what has to be done  this is why there s this interaction between the analysis and the construal 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yep  
 none 	the b  the   the double arrow 
 none 	yep 
 none 	so  uh  yeah  i mean  it doesn t magically make ambiguity go away 
 none 	no  
 none 	but it does say that  uh  if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose  then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	and if that s not consistent with other things  then you ve gotta reject that reading 
 none 	yep 
 none 	you con   you conditioned me with your first sentence  and so i thought   why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose   uh  oh  uh  
 none 	he slipped on the wet floor 
 none 	right 
 none 	you don t find that usage  uh   uh  i checked for it in the brown national corpus  the  walk into it  never really means  w  as in walked smack  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  run into  does 
 none 	yeah  but  y  y  if you find  walked smacked into the cafe  or   slammed into the wall   
 none 	yeah  no  but   run into  does 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	because you will find  run into   uh  well  or  into the cafe   for that m  you know    his car ran into the cafe  
 none 	cars run into telephone poles all the time 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  or you can run into an old friend  or run 
 none 	well  you can  run into  in that sense too 
 none 	no 
 none 	but  uh 
 none 	yeah   run into  might even be more impact sense than  you know  container sense 
 none 	right 
 none 	depends 
 none 	but   like   run into an old friend   it probably needs its own construction 
 none 	i mean  uh  you know  george would have i m sure some exa  complicated ex  reason why it really was an instance of something else and maybe it is  but  um  there are idioms and my guess is that s one of them  but  um   i don t know 
 none 	mm hmm  mm hmm 
 none 	all contact 
 none 	i mean  there  there s contact that doesn t   social contact  whatever  i mean 
 none 	uh 
 none 	sudden surprising contact  right 
 none 	yeah  but it s   it s   it s   it s   right  i  yeah  it s more  
 none 	forceful 
 none 	but of course  no  i  i  i mean it has a life of its own  it s sort of partially inspired by the spatial  
 none 	well  this is this motivated   but yeah   oh yeah  mo  for sure  motivated  but then you can t parse on motivated 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  right 
 none 	too bad 
 none 	uh 
 none 	you should get a t_shirt that says that 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	there s   there s lots of things you could make t_shirts out of  but  uh  this has gotten  
 none 	i mean wh 
 none 	we don t need the words to that 
 none 	pro  probably not your marks in the kitchen  today  not   not your marks 
 none 	what 
 none 	oh  no no no no no no no no no  we re not going there 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	in other news 
 none 	o_k  so  um  anything else you want to ask us about the thesis proposal  you got  
 none 	well 
 none 	we could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it 
 none 	well there   actually   the   i  what would have been really nice is to find an example for all of this  uh  from our domain 
 none 	so maybe if we w  if we can make one up now  that would be c  incredibly helpful 
 none 	so  w  where it should illustrate uh   wh  when you say all this  do you mean  like  i don t know  the related work stuff  as well as  mappings 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	how  
 none 	right   right   r 
 none 	w  well we have  for example  a canonical use of something and y  it s  you know  we have some constructions and then it s construed as something  and then we   we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that s also relevant to the   to the domain 
 none 	o_k  f  let s   let s suppose you use  in  and  on  
 none 	i mean  that s what you started with 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so  in the bus  and  on the bus   um  that s actually a little tricky in english because to some extent they re synonyms 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i had two hours w  with george on this  so it  um  
 none 	o_k  what did he say 
 none 	did you  join the club 
 none 	right  oh  h  that s  
 none 	um 
 none 	 on the bus  is a m  is a metaphorical metonymy that relates some meta  path metaphorically and you re on   on that path and th  w  i mean it s   he   there s a platform notion  right   he s on the   standing on the bus waving to me   but th  the regular as we speak  j  johno was on the bus to new york   um  uh  he s   that s  uh  what did i call it here  the transportation schema  something  where you can be on the first flight  on the second flight  and you can be  you know  on the wagon 
 none 	yeah  i   i believe all that  it s just  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right  so   so that   that may or may not be what you   what you want to do  i mean you could do something much simpler like   under the bus   or something  where  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but it s   it s   unfortunately  this is not really something a tourist would ever say 
 none 	so 
 none 	well  unless he was repairing it or something  but yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but um 
 none 	uh  but o_k 
 none 	so in terms of the   this   we had   we had   initially we d   started discussing the  out of film  
 none 	i see 
 none 	right 
 none 	and there s a lot of  out of  analysis  so  um 
 none 	right 
 none 	could we capture that with a different construal of  
 none 	yeah  it s a little   it s  uh   we ve thought about it before  uh t  uh   to use the examples in other papers  and it s   it s a little complicated 
 none 	out of   out of film  in particular 
 none 	cuz you re like  it s a state of   there s resource  right  and like  what is film  the state   you know  you re out of the state of having film  right  and somehow film is standing for the re  the resour  the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	it s   yeah  i mean  but   and plus the fact that there s also s  i mean  can you say  like 
 none 	i mean 
 none 	it s a little bit  
 none 	 the film ran out  you know  or  maybe you could say something like  the film is out  so like the   the film went away from where it should be  namely with you  or something  right  you know 
 none 	yeah  is film the trajector 
 none 	the   the film   the film is gone  right  um 
 none 	i never really knew what was going on  i mean i   i find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that   that  i m out of film  means that i have left the state of having film or something like that  but 
 none 	it s weird 
 none 	that  
 none 	uh 
 none 	or   having  is also  um  associated with location  right  so if the film left   you know   state is being near film 
 none 	yeah  yeah 
 none 	so running   running out of something is different from being out of somewhere 
 none 	or being out of something as  uh   as well 
 none 	so  running out of it  definitely has a process aspect to it 
 none 	mm hmm  but that s from run  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	so  b  that s o_k  i mean   b  but the difference is  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	is the d  the final state of running out of something is being out of it 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah  so th 
 none 	you got there  you got to out of it  yeah 
 none 	that part is fine 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but  uh  
 none 	hmm 
 none 	yeah  so   so nob  so no one has in   in   of the  uh  professional linguists  they haven t   there was this whole thesis on  out of  
 none 	uh 
 none 	there was  who 
 none 	well  there   i thought   or there was a paper on it  huh 
 none 	out 
 none 	there was one on   on  out  or  out of  
 none 	there was a 
 none 	well  it may be just  out   yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	i think there was  over  but there was also a paper on  out  
 none 	yeah  lind  susan lindner  right  the   the    the syrup spread out   that kind of thing 
 none 	or something 
 none 	oh  yeah  you re right  yeah 
 none 	yeah  and all that sort of stuff 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	and undoubtably there s been reams of work about it in cognitive linguistics  but 
 none 	o_k  but anyway  we re not gonna do that between now and next week 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	so  um  
 none 	it s not one of the y  it s more straightforward ones   forward ones to defend  so you probably don t want to use it for the purposes   th  these are   you re addressing like  computational linguists  right  or   are you 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	there s gonna be four computational linguists  computer  it s  
 none 	o_k  but more emphasis on the computational  or emphasis on the linguist 
 none 	more   there s going to be the   just four computational linguists  by coincidence  but the rest is  whatever  biocomputing people and physicists 
 none 	no no no  but not for your talk  i m  we re worrying about the th  the thes  it s just for one guy 
 none 	oh  o_k 
 none 	oh  the thesis  that s   that s computa  should be very computational  and  uh  someth 
 none 	oh  i meant this  you know  like  
 none 	o_k  so i would try to   i would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	you know  it s an obvious one   but  uh  
 none 	totally weird stuff 
 none 	i mean the   the old bakery example might be nice   is there a bakery around here   so if you c  we really just construe it as a  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	around 
 none 	no  it s the bakery itself   is it a building  uh  that you want to go to  or is it something to eat that you want to buy 
 none 	oh 
 none 	oh  oh yeah  yeah  we ve thought about that  right  right 
 none 	and then  
 none 	nnn 
 none 	no  what    bakery   can t be something you re gonna eat 
 none 	no  no  the question is d  do you wanna   do you wanna construe   do you wanna constr strue r  exactly  it s because do you wanna c  do you want to view the bakery as a p  a place that   that   i  for example  if   y 
 none 	sh 
 none 	it s a speech act 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	where you can get baked goods 
 none 	well th  well  that s one  you want to buy something 
 none 	but the other is  uh  yo  you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there d be a bakery in the neighborhood  or  um  pfff you know  you wonder how people here make their living  and   there re all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery that doesn t mean   i want to buy some baked goods  
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	o_k 
 none 	but um  those are interesting examples but it s not clear that they re mainly construal examples 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so it s a lot of pragmatics  there  that might be beyond what you want to do 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	there s all sorts of stuff going on  so let s   so let s think about this from the point of view of construal  so let s first do a   so the metonymy thing is probably the easiest and a  and actually the  
 none 	though  the one you have isn t quite  
 none 	you mean the s 
 none 	you mean  the steak wants to pay  
 none 	n  no not that one  that s   that s a   the sort of background  this is the t  uh  page five 
 none 	about plato and the book 
 none 	no 
 none 	oh  um 
 none 	no 
 none 	onward 
 none 	just beyond that 
 none 	how much does it cost 
 none 	where is the castle  how old is it  how much does it cost 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	a castle 
 none 	oh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	to go in  that s like  
 none 	two hundred million dollars 
 none 	right 
 none 	it s not for sale 
 none 	uh 
 none 	so
 none 	yeah  i think that s a good example  actually 
 none 	s 
 none 	yeah  that s good  u 
 none 	but as nancy just su  suggested it s probably ellipticus  huh 
 none 	ellipsis 
 none 	like    it   doesn t refer to  thing   it refers to acti  you know  j  thing standing for activ  most relevant activity for a tourist   you could think of it that way  but 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	well  shoot  isn t that   i mean  that s what   figuring that out is what this is about 
 none 	well  i mean  my argument here is   it s   it s   it s the same thing as  plato s on the top shelf   i m con  you know  th  that you can refer to a book of plato by using  plato   and you can refer back to it  and so you can   castles have   as tourist sites  have admission fees  so you can say  where is the castle  how much does it cost  
 none 	yeah  yeah  no  i  i agree 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	no no  i   i m agreeing that this is a good  um  
 none 	um 
 none 	 how far is it from here   so 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	you re also not referring to the width of the object  or so  www 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	o_k  can we think of a nice metaphorical use of  where  in the tourist s domain 
 none 	um 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so you know it s   you   you can sometimes use   where   f  for   when   in the sense of  you know 
 none 	o 
 none 	um  where   wh  where   where was  um 
 none 	 where was heidelberg  um  in the thirty years  war  
 none 	or something 
 none 	uh  yeah 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	you know  or some such thing 
 none 	like what side were they on  or    
 none 	um 
 none 	what 
 none 	yeah  essentially  yeah 
 none 	o_k  i was like   huh  it was here    like   um 
 none 	but anyway th  so there are   there are cases like that  um 
 none 	ah 
 none 	or like its developmental state or something like that  you could   i guess you could get that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	um 
 none 	um 
 none 	i mean  there s also things like   i mean  s  um  i guess
 none 	i could ask something like  where can i find out about blah blah blah  in a sort of   doesn t nece  i don t necessarily have to care about the spatial location  just give me a phone number and i ll call them or something like that 
 none 	yeah  there certainly is that  yeah 
 none 	you know   where could i learn its opening hours   or something 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	but that s
 none 	hmm 
 none 	not metaphorical 
 none 	it s another  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	so we re thinking about  um  or we could also think about  uh  
 none 	well  i   i   i  
 none 	how about  i m in a hurry  
 none 	state 
 none 	it i  but it s a state   and the   the issue is  is that   it may be just a usage  you know  that it s not particularly metaphorical  i don t know 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	right 
 none 	oh 
 none 	so you want a more exotic one   version of that 
 none 	yeah  yeah  right 
 none 	i m really into  
 none 	ah  how about
 none 	i   i   i   you know   i m in   i m in a state of exhaustion   or something like that  which a tourist w  huh 
 none 	do you really say that 
 none 	would you really say that 
 none 	a st  uh  well  you can certainly say  um  you know   i m in overload  
 none 	yeah 
 none 	i  i m really into art  uh  
 none 	tu  stur  tourists will often say that 
 none 	yeah  i was gonna say  like  
 none 	oh  you can do that 
 none 	really  of course that s   that   that s definitely a  uh   that s a  uh  
 none 	fixed 
 none 	a fixed expression  yeah 
 none 	right  but   
 none 	there re too   there re all sorts of fixed expressions i don t   like uh
 none 	 i m out of sorts now  
 none 	right 
 none 	like
 none 	 i m in trouble  
 none 	well i   when  uh   just f  u  the data that i ve looked at so far that rec  i mean  there s tons of cases for polysemy 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	so  you know  mak  re  making reference to buildings as institutions  as containers  as build  you know  whatever 
 none 	uh huh 
 none 	right 
 none 	um  so ib  in mus  for example  in museums  you know  as a building or as something where pictures hang versus  you know  ev  something that puts on exhibits  so forth  but  
 none 	right  as an institution  yeah 
 none 	um 
 none 	why don t you want to use any of those 
 none 	hmm 
 none 	so y  you don t wanna use one that s  
 none 	yeah  well   no  but this   that s what i have  you know  started doing 
 none 	the castle   the   that old castle one is sort of  
 none 	metonymy  polysemy 
 none 	i love van gogh 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	ah 
 none 	 i wanna go see the van gogh  
 none 	oh geez 
 none 	anyway  i m sorry 
 none 	but i think the argument should be   uh  can be made that  you know  despite the fact that this is not the most met  metaphorical domain  because people interacting with h_t_i systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical  construal still is  uh  you know  completely  um  key in terms of finding out any of these things  so  um 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	so that s   that s   that s a   that s a reasonable point  that it   in this domain you re gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy 
 none 	we  uh   i   with a   i looked   with a student i looked at the entire database that we have on heidelberg for cases of metonymy 
 none 	and polysemy  and stuff like that 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	hardly anything  so not even in descriptions w  did we find anything  um  relevant 
 none 	i have to go 
 none 	alright  yeah 
 none 	but o_k this is just something we ll   we ll see  um 
 none 	right  s  see you 
 none 	and deal with 
 none 	o_k  well 
 none 	i guess if anybody has additional suggestions  w  yeah 
 none 	i mean maybe the  where is something  question as a whole  you know  can be construed as  u  i  locational versus instructional request 
 none 	so  if we re not talk about the lexic  instruction 
 none 	location versus what 
 none 	instruction  oh  directions  yeah  oh  i thought that was   definitely treated as an example of construal 
 none 	sure 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	right 
 none 	yeah but then you re not on the lexical level  that s sort of one level higher 
 none 	oh  you want a lexical example 
 none 	but i don t need it 
 none 	well  you might want both 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	also it would be nice to get   ultimately to get a nice mental space example  so  even temporal references are  
 none 	we  
 none 	just in the spatial domain are rare 
 none 	but it s   it s easy to make up plausible ones 
 none 	you know 
 none 	when   when you re getting information on objects  so  i mean  
 none 	right  you know   you know  where r  yeah 
 none 	what color was this in   in in the nain  nineteenth century  what was this p  instead of   wh  what   you know   how was this painted  what color was this painted  um  was this alleyway open 
 none 	yeah 
 none 	yeah  maybe we can include that also in our second  uh  data run  we c  we can show people pictures of objects and then have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth 
 none 	uh 
 none 	mm hmm 
 none 	o_k  so why don t we plan to give you feedback electronically 
 none 	wish you a good trip 
 none 	all success 
 none 	for some reason when you said  feedback electronically  i thought of that   you ever see the simpsons where they re   like the family s got the buzzers and they buzz each other when they don t like what the other one is saying 
 none 	yeah  that s the   first one  i think  the very very first one 
 none 	it was a very early one  i don t know if it s the first one 
 none 	mmm 
 none 	mmm
