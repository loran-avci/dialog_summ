__label__False first you do a contextindependent
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah correct
__label__False i mean cuz there s this one instance when for example you re running down the stair i remember this meeting really well
__label__False yeah
__label__False um d and um ap ap apart from that i guess the the main thing i have t ta i have to talk is um where i m planning to go over the next week um
__label__False i mean there there s contact that doe nt social contact whatever i mean
__label__False improvement that s percentage increase is the percentage improvement over the baseline so that s
__label__False and
__label__False i mean let s put it this way i mean y you you have this complicated system with thousand and thousand parameter and you can tell it uh learn this thing
__label__False short meeting doe anyone have anything else
__label__False i mean the tcltk overhead is pretty high but it should nt matter
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but uh you know they both help each other if you have a if you have a better starting point then it help the aligner
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh channel one yes ok
__label__False this is wonderful to have a direct contact like that uh well th lem me ask you this it occurs to me one of my transcriber t told me today that she ll be finished with one meeting um by well she said tomorrow but then she said you know but the you know let s let s just uh say maybe the day after just to be s on the safe side
__label__False chuck
__label__False so it wa real
__label__False so of course it s around zero but well no it is
__label__False um i th i the other uh the the last w uh meeting eh i do nt know if you remain we have problem to with the with with the parameter with the representation of parameter because the the valley and the peak in the signal eh look like eh it doe nt follow to the to the energy in the signal
__label__False yeah so it s uh it s we do nt wan na hire a bunch of people a longterm staff because the the funding that we ve gotten is sort of a big chunk for this year but having temporary people doing some specific thing that we need is actually a perfect match to that kind of uh funding so
__label__False it s like like dynamic ra dram
__label__False ah
__label__False ah oh it w it wa you yeah
__label__False alright well
__label__False and so i m gon na apply that to um compare it with the result by um king and taylor who did um these um using recurrent neural net they recognized um a set of phonological feature um and made a mapping from the mfcc s to these phonological feature so i m gon na do a similar thing with with support vector machine and see if
__label__False exactly yeah also these thing may or may not get their own structure in the future
__label__False who us this uh this data structure
__label__False ok
__label__False ah
__label__False and eh so eh i wa eh i am transcribing the the first session and i i have found eh eh one thousand acoustic event eh besides the overlapping zone eh i i i mean the eh breath eh aspiration eh eh talk eh eh clap eh
__label__False yeah
__label__False eight three two four three eight seven three three eight
__label__False tha there are some case like where the the wrong speaker uh these ca
__label__False so they were sort of building here ok
__label__False that would be even even more distinct of a binary decision
__label__False i mean i do nt know if there s a way to replace a battery if it happens in the middle of a meeting maybe that s hopeless anyway but
__label__False i actually gave
__label__False just give it a title
__label__False a week week and a half
__label__False yeah
__label__False tu stur tourist will often say that
__label__False yeah
__label__False so i downloaded the software and compiled all of that and it compiled fine no problem
__label__False u yeah
__label__False like you have to go and yeah
__label__False like suppose you fixed some typ no jane fixed some typo and you wan na see what effect doe that have on the word error then we can f we c
__label__False hey what a good idea we could do the same sheet for everyone have them all read them at once
__label__False but if we look at it in one sentence it apparently it s good i think
__label__False so it s the paper that describe basically the um system that were proposed for the aurora
__label__False a usual
__label__False what what wa it
__label__False yep
__label__False and it look like the overall result a they are now even without you know any any bug being fixed is that uh on the the other task we had this average of uh forty uh nine percent or so improvement
__label__False ok so that s given in their input right
__label__False ok
__label__False i may even think that we could look take construction and and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammar that that tilman is using is a you said nothing but a mathematical formalism and you can just do anything with it whether it s syntactic tree
__label__False but what
__label__False we have the little tiny ibm machine that might someday grow up to be a big ibm machine
__label__False uh
__label__False whereas everything that we talked about them doing at at uw and so forth really doe they re actually talking
__label__False but i m using running that through my uh damp machine a a preamp a an alternative
__label__False yeah probably half
__label__False yeah ok fair enough
__label__False than just the feature yeah
__label__False porzel
__label__True i m not sure about the term
__label__False i i use the online scheme and only start the re recursion after the twentyfive twentyfifth frame
__label__False oh no
__label__True i can send it i ll send it yeah
__label__False well my feeling on it wa that it wa nt really important who said it you know
__label__False they tried to figure out the intention right simply by parsing it
__label__False and so we ve got it now htk s compiled for both the linux and for um the sparcs
__label__False o four two two zero two one
__label__False well it s sequential
__label__False so so i wa gon na ask i guess about any any other thing that that that either of you wanted to talk about especially since
__label__False well like this relation is not linear
__label__True ok bhaskara will do the big show on friday
__label__False mmm
__label__False so so the the other way to do the scoring is using a a nist format called
__label__False i mean what i wa envisioning wa a pda with a cellular link in it
__label__False yeah
__label__False but anyway yeah
__label__False i just wrote this down yeah actually cuz morgan will say well you had some idea and he never said li he looked
__label__False yeah
__label__False transcript one four three one dash one four five zero
__label__False and so that wa important to know a a baseline
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False well s
__label__False oops
__label__False so
__label__False and johno s already done that uh looked at the dem uh the looked at the smartkom stuff
__label__False and their their target are based on canonical mapping of phone to acoustic f feature
__label__False i is that a noisy condition
__label__False i do nt know if it actually manipulate the source though that might be a bit complicated i think it might it might be simpler to just have a script that you know
__label__False seven six three three three seven seven eight two three
__label__False like if you hold down alt and then tap tab you just the s just the task manager w window come up
__label__False yeah
__label__False getting ahead of myself
__label__False porzel
__label__False where s the midpoint and they do fine
__label__False and if we can do thing on linux some of the machine we have going already like swede
__label__False mmm
__label__False this
__label__False sure
__label__False i have several in my head yeah
__label__False eight one eight zero one eight three eight seven seven
__label__False oh well no i guess not but
__label__False uhhuh is not a frequent a it sort of would be in switchboard if you looked at just a word frequency list of oneword short utterance and yeah is way up there but not uhhuh and so i wa thinking thi it s not like you re being encouraged by everybody else to keep talking in the meeting and uh that s all i i ll stop there cuz i i think what you say make a lot of sense but it wa sort of
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False good
__label__False so by having an additional uh feature which say this is speech and this is nonspeech i mean it certainly help in some unseen noise condition for the neural net
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but i know i just remember it had to do with you know uh positional parameter and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them
__label__False that s how you get down to twentyeight
__label__False yeah so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False and i you know i ve also d uh discovered
__label__False nine zero nine three nine two five two five
__label__False hmm
__label__False um
__label__False so what i mean is like the implementation that you used wa something that you coded up here or you grabbed code from somewhere else
__label__False but so i wa just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digit doing a forced alignment and doing the timing
__label__False hmm
__label__False pardon me
__label__False right
__label__False right
__label__False right
__label__False so you re saying add the macrophone data to the training of the neural net the tandem net
__label__False i m just not sure what we should do
__label__False i i do nt remember the i th they were not using the htk delta
__label__False ok
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False so it s that s just how it is
__label__False you know they re doing it anyway and unless we tell them different they re gon na transcribe it
__label__False so there s a question of how easy or how hard to modify and how that impact the amount of changing that s done
__label__False nancy um she wa sorta finishing up the uh calculation of mark and assigning of grade but i do nt know if she should be here
__label__False interesting
__label__False i have no idea mmm i just yeah
__label__False y yeah yeah
__label__False no it s uh swi
__label__False but i mean you could uh if if if that look promising you could you know r uh run the overall test set with a with a few different uh pruning threshold for both and presumably he s running at some pruning threshold that s that s uh you know get very few search error but is is relatively fast and
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and check the segmentation yeah
__label__False i think wa both a a pruning problem and possibly a problem with needing constraint on word location and so we tried both of these st thing we tried saying
__label__False yeah ok then i think it s a good idea then i think it s a good idea because it
__label__False alright yeah
__label__False and um i think with an acronym that s a clear case where it would be an easy change to incorporate
__label__False well i m i m i m saying that s a simplified version of what s really happening what s really happening is well when i m talking to you right now you re getting the direct sound from my speech but you re also getting uh the indirect sound that s bounced around the room a number of time
__label__False uh
__label__False that s horrible
__label__False so so so this is so i it ll happen
__label__False no no because this is maybe something that we can do without involving dave and and putting more burden on him
__label__False well especially with morgan with the way we have the microphone arranged i m sort of right on axis and it would be very hard to tell
__label__False well we do nt know yet
__label__False ok
__label__False if they use ssh they have to have an account anyways
__label__False hmm
__label__False it could t it could
__label__False except i s got a pda way before well i wa doing hand i wa doing wearable computer at boeing so i guess i sort of count but
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i i i wa thinking ok so just set to set to some really low number the the nonvoiced um phone right and then renormalize
__label__False i i want to do it
__label__False yeah
__label__False th they re just doing their own thing like while they re waiting ok
__label__False i wan na ask about um some aud audio monitoring on some of the um well some of the equipment
__label__False which friday
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yes
__label__False yeah
__label__False huh
__label__False wow
__label__False or even if we could attach two headband like i do nt mind those but it they bounce around
__label__False right so the the tradeoff is you get longer utterance but you miss fewer utterance
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no no
__label__False a simultaneous digit ok
__label__False well it s it well because
__label__False or or just same digit see if anyone notice
__label__False nnn this well i ve i have project but then the my prof professor of one of my class also wa ha a final that he s giving u and he s giving u five day to do it which mean it going to be hard
__label__False hopefully
__label__False nothing against you and your handsoldering but
__label__False yeah
__label__True ok so um um i spoke i had a meeting with dave gelbart on on and he had uh excellent idea on how the interface could be modified to to do this kind of representation
__label__False what wa is that i
__label__False oh sorry
__label__False yeah and we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meeting
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah so we ll see what happen with this
__label__False eh n
__label__False i have a question about the slot of the spg action so the enterviewapproach the the the eva um those are fixed slot in this particular action every action of this kind will have a choice
__label__False no no i just figured you p
__label__False so they have to call me and ask
__label__False that s what
__label__False um
__label__False um
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah oh it s a good idea it s a good idea i think
__label__False or if uh you know in the future if linux machine become like way cheaper than uh you know solaris machine then you know that would nt be a reason not to use linux anymore so
__label__False you know if you if if if there s a lot of phone in one second maybe you ll get a a really good sampling of all these different thing and and uh on the other hand if someone s talking slowly maybe you d need more so
__label__False ok i see
__label__False um
__label__False i d like to see more
__label__False right we knew it would be longer to have multiple group
__label__False i m just surprised that you re getting fifteen percent relative worse on the wel on the highly mismatch yeah
__label__False um
__label__False this one is you do nt need it alright
__label__False uh yeah per e s s someone told that perhaps it s not fair to do that because the um to make a good vad you do nt have enough to with the the feature that are the baseline feature so mmm you need more feature
__label__False good
__label__False and this is dan with transcript ten five seven one one eight five o one six four six nine eight seven zero
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False and um so one of the thing that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is um w why are you spending so much time uh on the uh feature issue uh when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before and then just broadened it a bit instead of just ta using silence a putative change point also
__label__False and then and then here you on this scale you have it either be ego or allocentric
__label__False and the the the the thing that got mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he wa trying to do and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanism it turned out inherently not to cover the space
__label__False um so s
__label__False maybe
__label__False i mean that s why i did the web form because for me that would be my most convenient
__label__False you mean another transmitter or or
__label__False you could nt you could nt find the right connector to go into these thing
__label__False mmm
__label__False i think that s sufficient because actually the recognition of laughter once you kn um you know is pretty good so a long a you can stick a you know a t a tag in there that that indicates that there wa laughter that would probably be uh sufficient to train model
__label__False i think that for the recognizer for the meeting recorder that it s better that i do nt speak
__label__False mmm
__label__False and some some thing will always be sort of too not significant enough
__label__False why is it that i can read your mind
__label__False yeah
__label__False so we had
__label__False exactly and then you ca then you can do a s
__label__False uh yeah i i think definitely s so absolutely yeah whoever we have working on the acoustic for the meeting recorder are gon na start with that
__label__False for the aurora data that it wa trained on it wa different like for tidigits you used a a previous system that you had i guess
__label__False yeah but then you re effectively using the resource of the backup system
__label__False ah interesting
__label__False it s in my note
__label__False yeah i mean y y you folk have probably already told me but were were you intending to do a eurospeech submission or
__label__False it took me a couple hour to write the script and then it it probably took me maybe fortyfive minute just going through it now obviously it will be a lot faster from now on because now i sort of understand how it work
__label__False and so they had sixteen so that s pretty close
__label__False at the repository level there certainly is you can mark a file a a you ca nt check this out
__label__False well actu yeah when we looked at this
__label__False so why were you getting forty one here is this
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False so it s a very simple change to make and it doe nt seem to hurt all that much so i
__label__False hmm and
__label__False i do nt u understand
__label__True well we should talk to them about it because i know that sri is also in the process of looking at stuff and so you know what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that
__label__False june
__label__False i have had disk which are gone in a year
__label__False so far
__label__False anyway that wa just something we wondered about
__label__False well that s fine but we have to see the function now ha it become all point five or not
__label__False well for me it seems that uh r
__label__False mmm
__label__False halfway done yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False it s log o of capital y yeah right capital y
__label__False mmm yeah
__label__False you ll selfrepair yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False really
__label__False but there are no boot model in fact
__label__False i think it s not going to be i do nt think it s going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hour then to do one hour i think it s not going to be thirty t
__label__False and then of course the c i guess maybe there can be the
__label__False we have this problem with the overloading of the term feature so uh what are the variable what we re calling this one what are the variable that they re found finding useful um for
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False everyone s adjusting their microphone of course
__label__False hmm
__label__False is it two gig an hour i m off by an order of magni that s alright order of two factor of two
__label__False umh
__label__False what if
__label__False i did and now i love it so much
__label__False where is that seventynine fifty
__label__False it wa a technical term that she did nt recognize
__label__False ok
__label__False no i did nt mean anybody any particular system i meant this ht k backend if they
__label__False another option is to m make a non make it owned by a not real user and then root will be able to do it
__label__False so that s matched training is that what that is
__label__False yeah
__label__False what wa his name do you remember that guy
__label__False because what will happen then is that people repeat repeat or a much a they can of that phrasing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean uh we re talking about digit now and and so um there s a bunch of stuff that ha nt been marked yet
__label__False but we do nt even necessarily need to end up distributing password at all
__label__False so this is sort of what it look like now some simple go action from it from an object named peter s kirche of the type church to an object named powdertower of the type tower
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False food and drink and so forth so
__label__False uh anything to talk about
__label__False i consider acoustic event eh the silent too
__label__False right
__label__False right so you could s
__label__False oh i m channel must be channel one channel one yes ok
__label__False um
__label__False so what i have on these form here is for the read number read digit task and it s extracted directly from aurora and uh
__label__False i mentioned several that w had to do with implication drawn from intonational contour and that wa nt a directly relevant to what he s doing
__label__False but thanks to fey we already have sort of a nice blueprint and i can work with that
__label__False oh actually it s it it would nt affect any of our node right
__label__False i think so it s not
__label__False uh
__label__False um
__label__False it s a we have we have due to variation in funding we have we seem to be doing uh very well on m money for this this year and next year we may have have much le so i do nt wan na hire a
__label__False no no what i m saying is that we re gon na have to put together some kind of a little superstructure d some sort of demo box that it that doe nt do a whole lot but it somehow connects to uh remotely to this iram board which will be doing the real computation
__label__False uh yeah it s uh
__label__False well the term itself is you know
__label__False yeah
__label__False see because it because this is this is just like a single number to tell you um
__label__False five one six six three six seven seven three two eight nine
__label__False seven o nine o o four seven one one eight
__label__False yeah
__label__False let s look at an example
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so they do it right at the beginning of the semester
__label__True smartkom
__label__False hmm
__label__False i mean that s that s that s a fairly strong indication of dislike
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s ok
__label__True well i i will look to try if i move this parameter in their code what happens maybe everything is
__label__False so
__label__False well yeah but in the s uh let s just deal with the s the simple case of we re not worrying about timing or anything
__label__False yeah
__label__False well actually you have only have two choice you can either do a twopoint or a threepoint which is you
__label__False but i i i do nt know it s actually been awhile since i ve looked at it
__label__False yeah
__label__False the first testing is with task data
__label__False so we ll just have to see if that work
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah and i do nt need to be here particularly deeply
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so one of these transcript wa gone over by a transcriber and then i handmarked it myself so that we do have uh the beginning and ending of individual utterance
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False and of course i d we d we d like to see it too so yeah
__label__False so if he wanted to you know just have a few to start with he could
__label__False is
__label__False i mean he s talking about just using text pretty much or
__label__False but you may be in the wrong range for the pl p feature for some reason
__label__False yeah th that d be
__label__False yeah
__label__False just
__label__False and still i do nt have the result for tidigits
__label__False ok
__label__False mfcc feature
__label__False i used point five percent which wa the default value in the in the program here
__label__False wait what what are the day
__label__False so the previous syst it s based on the system that ha a fiftythree point sixtysix percent improvement
__label__False the nice thing about cv is is you can be on a different machine
__label__False well ok that s the point
__label__False yeah
__label__False what are the nature of most of the change
__label__True i m invited to do some consulting with a bank in geneva which ha an affiliation with a research institute in geneva which i forgot the name of
__label__False nope
__label__False oh f a lot of thing
__label__False yeah the the the cumbersome thing is is um is that you actually have to dump out little little file so for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out a separate file
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that s cool
__label__False two zero one one dash two zero three zero
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah that s right we ve got lot of bit of noise
__label__False great great great yeah i agree
__label__False right great ok
__label__False ah nice
__label__False g given i i mean i wa i wa i wa gon na ask you anyway uh how you assessed that thing were better
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok let s uh yeah they re
__label__False we ll see that
__label__False yeah
__label__False or to just do the clustering knowing that you re capturing both it s just that the kind of clustering we ve done before ha nt had that uh distance factor or location factor in it in the same way and so we re not really modeling it directly if somebody doe we sh maybe we add that because i think it would be a pretty big difference when you listen you can sort of tell where people are not which s you know side but
__label__False a couple time yeah that s right yeah
__label__False we can store them here
__label__False well eh you know that i work i begin to work with a new feature to detect voiceunvoice
__label__False it s starting to grow on me
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so bu l de fff
__label__False yeah well you know uh we ll get we ll get to uh spanish voice sometime and we do we want to recognize uh you too
__label__False eight eight four two five nine seven four five zero
__label__False and then it s got all it s a verb now
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False no
__label__False um but i i i what i take it to mean is doing doing the dumb thing uh with two microphone would be very difficult to get too much out of it but
__label__False the doing business is certainly not
__label__False yeah
__label__False huh
__label__False and and a and and also um part of what s nice about this is that this is uh um a realistic almost realistic database
__label__False robert like to be abstract and that s what i just thought he wa doing
__label__False and i thought that our conclusion wa that we did nt want to do that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i actually wanted to show that to you guy now but um
__label__False yeah but i do nt know that one so what s that mean
__label__False uh
__label__False ok
__label__False and now what do we do with it is is a s separate question
__label__False there were like the you know and all that stuff but
__label__False maybe yeah
__label__False but
__label__False no
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and so we think we think we have a shot at at that
__label__False have a good trip
__label__False the yeah it wa it turn out that if if you have multiple billion of dollar y you can do all sort of weird thing and
__label__False oh ok ok
__label__False oh ok
__label__False not the best
__label__False right s yeah um
__label__False huh
__label__False so the effect the immediate effect is gon na be to increase your error rate
__label__False i think
__label__False yeah
__label__False so they just do a little grep for
__label__False oh good
__label__False uh
__label__False the the three hundred is eh considered only you your transcription
__label__False ok
__label__False uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False w well you have distance and you have
__label__False that i look in the with the other nnn the other mlp that we have are more or le the same number
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False it
__label__False yeah
__label__False well there the and the other aspect of it is um that when the microphone is not welladjusted then y i i even if it s not a lapel mike you can get lapel mike type behavior cuz i m i m expecting for example with this that you re gon na end up you know picking up other people signal
__label__False no
__label__False be my guest
__label__False channel b
__label__False and then it will be you know this eve every now and then there ll be a a beep missing
__label__False we can rel open it up again
__label__False there could be some missing one but
__label__False because
__label__False i it make their their job extremely easy yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but it wo nt be installed for a little while
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False for one meeting
__label__False ok
__label__False well it s not trained on finnish
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok no i wa j curious yeah i do nt think it s a big deal for this application but but yeah it s a
__label__False yep
__label__False they run lda on the feature right before they train the model
__label__False yeah but
__label__False so uh you know it could be that we re just pruning too much
__label__False let s not forget we re gon na get some very strong input from these sub dis from these discourse thing right
__label__False i do nt know exactly because tsk maybe do better some step the general eh diagram
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False i m i i i think eh we need this information to nnn
__label__False yeah so we have the mel f filter bank we have the fft so we just
__label__False buying buying his food
__label__False if if that mean that it s not gon na be backedup standardly great
__label__False y
__label__False nnn
__label__False it look like it
__label__False no
__label__False i think we re uh
__label__False yeah there s a lot of pronoun
__label__False stuart s book about you know the
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False w we we have time yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we did it again morgan
__label__False yeah then after that it is s almost the same a the baseline prop system
__label__False ok but then there s another thing that also thilo s involved with which is um
__label__False seven one four four four two two two seven two one eight
__label__False the demo wa one of them
__label__False i have nt looked at these um cuz i wa gone last week but but don had told me that there s a difference in some of the convention
__label__False and so the filter bank is chosen in fact to sort of integrate out the effect of pitch and she s saying you know trying so the particular measure that she chose wa the variance of this m of this difference but that might not be the right number
__label__False yeah
__label__False and not care whether that s consistent with anything
__label__False yeah
__label__False a mailing list
__label__False right
__label__False i think that s a good idea
__label__False i start feeling the tip directly
__label__False n there wa also this uh email from dan regarding the speechnon nonspeech segmentation thing
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s also a question of the recursiveness and and a hier hierarchy um in there do we want the schema just blump blump blump blump
__label__False this happened
__label__False right
__label__False too bad
__label__False yeah it wa good having you
__label__False yeah yeah they re working away
__label__False yes i m using tandem feature
__label__False right so you could get email
__label__False on the same uh speechdatcar aurora
__label__False that s just background speech
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False right
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False w o
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that it doe nt this assume though that they re evenly weighted
__label__False and and not bother with with this acoustic uh processing but i think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noiseprocessing a well a uh the convolutional kind of thing we were doing
__label__False w
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh no
__label__False um and basically um in his variable that he used um or measure of snr at at subbands actually critical band like um the um measure of correlation and covariance um within the subbands and um and at the upper level detecting uh sonorance and voicing
__label__False yeah
__label__False although you know normally i mean the channel go to four four thousand right so um
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False or i or i it ll be tight you wo nt it ll be hard to decide but i mean i guess i guess the thing is uh this is another smaller case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty which make me think bayesnet should be the way to solve these thing so if you had if for every construction right you could say well there here s the whereis construction
__label__False we ll see whether it s gon na make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not i m not sure it partly depends on w what your thesis turn out to be and how that go
__label__False so that
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False i mean if it s a tapping sound you would nt necessarily or you know something like that it d be it might be hard to know that it wa two separate event
__label__False yeah so you ll have si
__label__False if this if this is the noise signal
__label__False right so let s see the variable disc admission fee is a binary thing time of day is like morning afternoon night is that the deal
__label__False different way yeah
__label__False so there is
__label__False well
__label__False yeah it feel funny huh if we have the capability
__label__False and and did an other number stay the same insertion substitution stay the same
__label__False i thought you you said you were adding stuff but i do nt know
__label__False yeah
__label__False and that mean that that s more of a problem because y then you have to be there
__label__True no the time is now pretty much fixed it s the last week of april until the fourth of may so it s twentysixth through fourth
__label__False when
__label__False they re stored on popcorn
__label__False yeah i mean that s the thing it s ok to g
__label__False cuz there s thing that they are doing there that we certainly are not doing
__label__False so i m not picking huge chunk right now of meeting for them but
__label__False yeah yeah no i i agree
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False hello hello
__label__False so you shift it somehow this this whole curve is shifted again
__label__False eight nine three zero six two eight two seven six
__label__False well yeah there would there would have to be somebody to enforce the consistency yeah
__label__False oh god
__label__False so for the um read number task
__label__False how s that how it can be finite again
__label__False then i i would need to find a way to like smooth le also when there is high energy
__label__False what wa that say that last part again
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i like that test the wizard
__label__False nine four six six five one nine three five five seven seven zero three two six two five eight four two o six three six nine five six eight two nine nine zero six five five nine six seven four four six zero five one three six three o two five three four seven eight zero one six seven one five four four seven zero seven four eight nine one two one five four
__label__False mmm
__label__False i guess everybody know about
__label__False um however we just have one result which is the italian mismatch so
__label__False yeah that s
__label__False yeah
__label__False so um it s a little more noise robust
__label__False we re getting close yeah so
__label__False ok
__label__False well
__label__False you do nt have a hidden purist streak
__label__False mmm
__label__False aha bed mn there is
__label__False yeah
__label__False really
__label__False sure yeah
__label__False right
__label__False right exactly
__label__False those are th those are th what is going into the tandem net
__label__True this afternoon uh oh right for the meeting meeting yeah that s just cuz of something on campus
__label__False yeah
__label__False well this
__label__False five five five two nine nine three three six five
__label__False so long a i so long a it s the same baseline you ll be able to tell but but i m just gonn i m just saying that if you were to compare that with running that on the new data that it would be an a more optimistic outcome
__label__False nice
__label__False oh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False eight one nine one six three eight zero four
__label__False uh
__label__False right right but i mean
__label__False yeah um
__label__False great
__label__False yeah
__label__False whoop that s a mistake disfluency scratch start over
__label__False so if we re not talk about the lexic instruction
__label__False oh ok i never heard it ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False but you do nt have this this problem morgan is the one who doe this most
__label__False we d have to mark them
__label__False hmm
__label__False so
__label__False sure
__label__False did you actually look through your transcript or you just approved them all
__label__False i think no i think it s actually i think what s going on is backchanneling is something that happens in twoparty conversation and if you ask someone a question you essentially initiating a little twoparty conversation
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False maybe we d be able to meet that request of his a little more
__label__False ptm model then you switch to a context
__label__False um if if uh you do nt have search mechanism you just sort of have this really really long document i mean whenever i ve had a really really long document that it wa sitting on the web i ve always ended up printing it out
__label__False right
__label__False but uh
__label__False i see
__label__False right
__label__False and the wellmatched condition is what you might imagine that you might be able to approach if you know that this is the application
__label__False it d probably take two week or so to actually go through and do it and i went through all the other package on murph kevin murphy s page and i could nt find the necessary mix of free and uh with the gui and with this thing that we want
__label__False ok
__label__False two one four nine one nine eight nine eight nine
__label__False oh no no no no no no no no no we re not going there
__label__False we will r
__label__False doe it uh
__label__False but but what i m more concerned with now a an operational level is uh you know what do we do in four or five day
__label__False no because we re doing the beep file
__label__False i do nt think this will work alone
__label__False or you can run it on the whole data which is which is you know a
__label__False ok
__label__False he s right there yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False ok to uh
__label__False it s probably gon na n
__label__False i mean we have segmentation for the old meeting that are from his segmenter and so
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False i see
__label__False right
__label__False that wa it
__label__False i see
__label__False but we just decided to keep all the thing we extracted to point at the middle and then down
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False maybe it s just a way to decrease the importance of this particular parameter in the in the world feature vector cu if you add noise to one of the parameter you widen the distribution and
__label__False how many eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session in five eh in fortyfive minute
__label__False but but the question is if you train on one language but you have a broad coverage and then test in another doe that is that improve thing i c in comparison
__label__False ye all of these adaptation ha assume that the same person
__label__False yep yep that s right
__label__False um they are doing they re using first term only of the vector taylor series
__label__False huh ok
__label__False and a morgan pointed out that there are actually some advantage to it in term of breath noise and clothes rustling if no one else is talking
__label__False yes
__label__False the transcribing is sort of something i can imagine doing whereas having this distraction of having sort of something that look like it might be right but ha got some very wrong bit in is sort of a le le easy thing to do
__label__False yeah
__label__False right you you need but you need the text to tell it where it got it wrong yeah
__label__False six
__label__False andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know if possible what we were gon na be talking about because he s sort of peripherally involved to this point and if there s gon na be a topic about discussion about something that he uh strongly care about then he would come and
__label__False but uh the way the mean is adapted um it s signal dependent
__label__False yeah you you do have to be careful because of com compounded result i think we got some earlier result in which you trained on one language and tested on another and you did nt have three but you just had one language so you trained on one type of digit and tested on another didn
__label__False ha anybody ever been on an amtrak
__label__False where you can get baked good
__label__False you know if if there are lot of mumble and parenthesis and thing like that
__label__False shall we do some digit
__label__False yes w we we would like to test the wizard but you know if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task or any of the set up we get a more realistic you know set up a
__label__False and and s shawn yeah
__label__False ok yeah w what yo what you re calling the excitation a i recall is you re subtracting the the um the mel mel mel filter uh spectrum from the fft spectrum right
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False yes
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False the most noisy case are the distant microphone for testing
__label__False yeah i have one
__label__False maybe just maybe not the whole day but just you know maybe some i mean part of it
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False and it and a you can see from those picture you do get something that show some periodicity uh in frequency you know and and and also in time so so
__label__False well th well that s one you want to buy something
__label__False you can come in if you want
__label__False seems like you wan na as
__label__False six eight seven eight five eight eight one four
__label__False and you and and it s uh uh right it s only it s only one
__label__False i m completely willing to to to throw all of this away and completely redo it you know and and and it after some iteration we may just do that
__label__False radio two
__label__False no i just
__label__False so where where doe how do you wear that what doe that
__label__False ok but i it s it s a big deal to get that
__label__False let s assume this is our our question
__label__False yeah that s the point
__label__False i do nt have the number in front of me so i m just imagining
__label__False four one two six four one five four three four seven three
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False take take several
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False right right definitely
__label__False so they could by hand
__label__False but um it s still an unlikely candidate for the tango mode i must say
__label__False on data from just that task that language
__label__False five five six two zero nine seven four zero four zero eight nine zero nine one six nine nine eight six six eight zero eight four two five seven seven two five seven two five two nine four eight eight four nine seven four six three eight zero one one eight zero seven three eight five six six five nine one nine six two nine three nine six six two zero five six two zero s three
__label__False yeah he popped in but i mean he s basically gone
__label__False it s with the noisy one yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False adam s agenda list he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition
__label__False that s right but i think javier s
__label__False um i mean what we were uh the condition it it gave u an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with meeting recorder digit even though there again these m macrophone digit were very very different from uh what we were going on here i mean we were nt talking over a telephone here
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False well i certainly read book by hand but for something like this i think it s easier to do it on the web
__label__False no you do nt need to
__label__False six nine eight four two two nine zero zero
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False you can actually never though really infer what you would get with a different
__label__False right right
__label__False that s all recorded
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False you could just mount it to that and they would nt even notice
__label__False yeah
__label__False you mean you do you do nt do all those normalization
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so that s a speech detector that s great
__label__False given that y and and do so instead of doing phonetic uh uh transcription for the whole thing which we know from the steve s experience with the switchboard transcription is you know very very timeconsuming and and you know it took them i do nt know how many month to do to get four hour and so that ha nt been really our focus
__label__False watch this yep that s me
__label__False and it certainly wa not a minute a chunk it wa a few second a chunk
__label__False i m not drinking tea what are you talking about
__label__False and uh with this i have to leave
__label__False um
__label__False yeah yep
__label__False zero one two nine four seven seven eight one
__label__False so you have uh you have uh nonspeech singleperson speech and multipleperson speech
__label__False cz czero and log energy also yeah
__label__False ok so there are certain cue that are very strong either lexical or topicbased um concept cue for one of those
__label__False sixteen over
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False they have a they have a thing for doing that and th they have for awhile in ht k
__label__False there s a link there that now say if you want to search by filter by a regular expression you can
__label__False it s the it s the spurt format
__label__False oh yeah ok
__label__False yeah nsa one and nsa three we re talking about those
__label__False yeah
__label__False and if we now do leave everything else a is the result should be the same right
__label__True well i m i sent a couple of item they re they re sort of practical i do nt know if you re if if that s too practical for what we re focused on
__label__False yeah
__label__True so i got in touch with joe and and uh from your email and thing like that and uh they added me to the list uh the mailing list and he gave me all of the pointer and everything that i needed and so i downloaded the um
__label__False yeah you can basically remove the the frame from the feature feature file and
__label__False ok
__label__False a long a they have one number and they know that there s only one beep maximum that go with that number
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh this is the like this but conditional no it s condition it s not exactly this it s modify
__label__False i m i m interested in it i just do nt have time to do it now
__label__False hmm
__label__False whereas you know if we d just get data we d never know what they actually wanted we d get no cue
__label__False pretty much the same
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah they re they re having birthday cake and such and so i ca nt miss that
__label__False this is what what do you uh what s in the paper there
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah the gothere the infoon and the location
__label__False this is in order to use the sri system or something right
__label__False oh ok
__label__False i i i think it you know another another bunch of digit more data is good
__label__False i do nt know what the
__label__False oh
__label__False and uh thilo had a e e a breakthrough with this this last week in term of getting the channelbased um uh s s speechnonspeech segmentation um up and running and i have nt i have nt been able to use that yet cuz i m working s re this is my top priority get the data clean and channelized
__label__False and if they have account here and they re modifying it if they re ac if they re so closely linked that they re actually modifying transcript and key file then they could do it by you know secureshelling into icsi under rcs at that point
__label__False sorry this microphone s moving around
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False um i think you re really trying very hard to make this a convenient a possible for people to do this
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh there is a minority in that group who is a arguing who are arguing for um uh having a further constraining of the latency
__label__False yeah i mean um um what you can do is um
__label__False yeah so that delay plus the lda
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh it depends what you what you do
__label__False course
__label__False i mean uh you know george would have i m sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really wa an instance of something else and maybe it is but um there are idiom and my guess is that s one of them but um i do nt know
__label__False so y you said if you i m only interested in whether he want to go there or not then i just look at that node look which one
__label__False right cuz if we have a fixed number of neuron
__label__False and uh the audio quality is so good
__label__False well this is
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False i i i m trying the htk with eh
__label__False so if it doe nt bounce around too much that s actually good placement
__label__False other way
__label__False two nine nine nine four five three four nine three
__label__False uh
__label__False two hundred and fifty thousand
__label__False oh i see
__label__True and um if it s useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at heidelberg or at the german ai center while you re in in the neighborhood
__label__False it s plugged in yeah
__label__False the giving a speech construction
__label__False ju
__label__False yeah i think he s taking two twentyfive a which is now
__label__False so it may get u some more information on the humanmachine pragmatic um that no one know anything about a of yesterday
__label__False ok
__label__False i wa just asking just out of curiosity if if with uh uh the sri recognizer getting one percent word error uh would we would we do better
__label__True the question we re gon na wan na go through next week when hynek show up i guess is given that we ve been if you look at what we ve been trying we re uh looking at uh by then i guess combination of feature and multiband
__label__False yeah
__label__True what doe what did um larry saul use for it wa the sonorant uh detector right
__label__False ok
__label__False much faster than doing everything alone ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False someone start someone stop
__label__False we can try them all and see which work better
__label__False ok
__label__False not a landmark at all
__label__False yeah i see
__label__False uh maybe
__label__False well let s look at it together and
__label__False which now is based on uh cleaned feature
__label__False and are those mutually exclusive set right got it uhhuh
__label__False it s it s
__label__False yeah i m wan na be this gone this weekend too
__label__False mc mcdonald s constant
__label__False yeah
__label__False then mmm
__label__False we
__label__False i do nt know how to notate that
__label__False there s supposed to be some out out outofwork shepherders or something in scotland but
__label__False so i you know might a well we i ju otherwise we wo nt get the work done on our deadline
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False i m sort of confused but this i m looking on the second page and it say
__label__False well if we apply the log we have e is n uh log
__label__False and um
__label__False hmm
__label__False one five three one one seven one five three zero five two
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False stage some political debate
__label__False the big problem wa they had the wrong number of beep in it
__label__False then we ll figure out the right the right set of weight for your tap for your filter in order to produce the effect of those those echo
__label__False mmm
__label__False by that time you ll be
__label__False you asked me to write to him and i think i forgot to ask him about that
__label__False so but you see now between between the male and the female there s certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range than there is say just within the male
__label__False um
__label__False have have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of in more of the meeting
__label__False uh the advantage being like it doe nt have the latency of the neural net if it if it can g and it gave me like uh one point
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh huh ok yeah so that s about eight per minute
__label__True might wan na try it both way
__label__False yeah
__label__False what s that
__label__True yeah i mean you can check with uh dave johnson i mean it it s
__label__False it s got two to both channel
__label__False eight eight three
__label__False that s we were nt that s why we increased the error rate
__label__False ok
__label__False i think we want to start off with the agenda
__label__False nine five one five three nine eight six one two nine one
__label__False but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False w what is the um the artifact you try to you re trying to get rid of when you do that
__label__False yeah i think
__label__False um
__label__False and so uh
__label__False plp doe the smoothing at the end by an autoregressive model and mel cepstrum doe it by just computing the lower cepstral coefficient
__label__False yeah
__label__False well you know and i also thought y liz ha this eh you know and i do also this this interest in the type of overlap that are involved these people would be great choice for doing coding of that type if we wanted or whatever so um
__label__False ok
__label__False i do nt see how someone could do forty hour a week on transcription
__label__False i
__label__False yep
__label__False so that s on th that s on the f the far field one though right yeah
__label__False uh beep bee
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you are in control
__label__False and then it doe also some
__label__False i could hear it
__label__False maybe you re done then
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False well i do nt think i well i do nt think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issue
__label__False yeah no i s i s i see this ha got the castle in it and stuff like that yep
__label__False but normally you re correct
__label__False hmm
__label__False i use the smoothed sm uh smoothed version but for high gain it s i do nt smooth
__label__False it s it s the htk result i mean so it s
__label__False but um we just did nt have time to play with you know tuning yet another yet another parameter
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False e
__label__False yep
__label__False what you you yeah
__label__False but the lunch meeting are pretty much one person getting up and
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False on the in the mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh ok
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False yeah
__label__False n i m successfully uh increasing the error rate
__label__False and in fact th thing get better with context dependent version
__label__False uh
__label__False depends i mean there is a um whole language learning story
__label__False yeah i mean make it a hundred or so
__label__False so uh i m suggesting we turn it around and and uh sort of we have anybody ha some mundane point that we could send an email later uh hold them for a bit and let s talk about the the researchy kind of thing
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah so maybe yeah when
__label__False i just do nt see why you would
__label__False but this number
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah so yeah so yep
__label__False wow
__label__False ok so i think we just got ta let thing slide for now and see see what s gon na happen nothing else really to do
__label__False so you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test
__label__False yeah
__label__False so how many channel do you get to have in a wireless setup
__label__False i did nt know that huh
__label__False uh n n not really because then we have the coordination issue
__label__False so you have uh basically two uh part the upper part is for tidigits and it s divided in three row of four four row each
__label__True and um srini wa gon na send me some slide but he did nt do it so from but i have the paper i can make a resume of that and then i stole an xschema from one of your talk i think
__label__False ok
__label__False from mike yeah
__label__False so uh bhaskara and i went off and looked at some technical question about were certain operation sort of legitimate beliefnet computation and wa there some known problem with them or had someone already uh solved you know how to do this and stuff
__label__False also another question might be
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah it s fixed the dictionary and the other estimation is when i do the uh online estimation i change the mean and variance of th for the noisy speech each time that i detect noise
__label__False it s all speech yeah yeah
__label__False so we have to come up with value for this and this this this and so forth
__label__False i speak into it and you hear it talk and i can sort of walk f through the information so this is like in half hour or fortyfive minute just fun
__label__False ok so uh he s not here so you get to
__label__False and um so out of these f s these high level category the subject can pick a couple such a if if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film the person can then decide
__label__False we could certainly break the meeting into pi piece
__label__False it s even more than that i think it it really give a very strong perspective that you know that what you were doing is not an unbiased experiment
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False or maybe could it be a click and the number
__label__False yeah ok i see your point
__label__False i mean uh some type of spectral subtraction y you get even worse result than the basis and uh
__label__False i i i knew that eh the signal eh eh would be different but eh the the problem is eh eh we eh detected eh difference event in the speech file eh collected by by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i guess if we have a ba another bayesnet to deal with this stuff the only r reason we can design it is cuz we know what each question is asking
__label__False robert
__label__False clean training and
__label__False um
__label__False ok
__label__False so for that reason when you in in in a hybrid system when you incorporate context one way or another you do get better score
__label__False no i mean it sound like i mean there there there are the usual number of of little little problem and bug and so forth but it sound like they re getting ironed out
__label__False um so this give like fiftyseven point seven percent uh s uh error rate reduction on the speechdatcar data
__label__False ok
__label__False but it it i st still see it a i mean there s there s a history to this too but i uh i do nt wan na go into but but i i i th i think it could be the thing that it the data is being viewed in a certain way uh that a beginning is here rather than there and so forth because the actual signalprocessing you re doing is slightly different
__label__False i mean that s the crucial part
__label__False zero
__label__False uh no no
__label__False yea
__label__False so he did nt know what i meant
__label__False and it would it seems like it would help them you know if they just finished a long passage and they heard one beep and then they hear it again they know it s the same beep
__label__False oh
__label__False but i mean it it it doe give a distribution
__label__False unprecedented
__label__False so that s getting a little cumbersome for them to type like five hundred
__label__False so the but i guess the k the question that i wa a er wondering or maybe robert wa proposing to me is
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m really into
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False we were thi yeah
__label__False i
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False hmm
__label__False well it is wonderful
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s it wa trained on some alignment obtained um uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s just
__label__False oh the yeah we could
__label__False yeah it d be interesting just to see i how much it change i bet it would nt change a lot
__label__False right
__label__False and then uh when y you sell it to somebody they will be a different person with a different car and so on
__label__False yeah let s let s see where we are at threethirty um
__label__False uh
__label__False no i m not sug i m not suggesting that we do nt have anything between the beep
__label__False six four one eight three one six six
__label__False yeah it wa is two
__label__False but there s a whole interesting discussion cuz of course the alignment are not perfect either and so um in fact we actually do nt have a a p
__label__False uh you y i think in some case you got some little improvement but it wa you know sort of a small improvement and it wa a a big added complication so you dropped it
__label__False well eh there is one thing that we can observe is that the mean are more different for for czero and cone than for the other coefficient
__label__False whew
__label__False yes
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean they they were people who did nt have account at icsi so they re they re harder to find
__label__False he wa in yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False one more than one percent relative improvement so from fiftythree point six it went to fifty f four point eight so it s like only slightly more than a percent improvement just like
__label__False i see
__label__False yeah i think
__label__False then
__label__False right
__label__False um if we could really get one percent on
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False precisely
__label__False d e i think yeah
__label__False but
__label__False so he doe nt have to have truth mark or ho
__label__False right or or ffts one or the other
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False and another might be that uh i d i would presume that in the studio uh uh situation recording read speech that if somebody did something a little funny or n pronounced something a little funny or made a little that they did nt include it they made them do it again
__label__False but some people have done exactly that sort of thing of of and the i mean it s not
__label__False you mean javier s
__label__False yeah
__label__False and then just close enough so that you get good volume so you know wearing it right about here seems to be about the right way to do it
__label__False that would
__label__False it s the transformation they re estimating on
__label__False ok
__label__True the other good thing about it is jerry can be on here on friday and he can weigh in a well
__label__False i i
__label__False we ve never signed anything that said that we could nt use anything that we did
__label__False oh so what do you have to do you have olt alt tab and
__label__False mmm
__label__False ok
__label__False we always get these people who are not in the class who it s interesting
__label__False this is le it s le robust
__label__False yeah i th
__label__False reason being you know it d be a pain to set up all the probability for that
__label__False yeah in pattern recognition or in
__label__False so yeah maybe i ll uh ping them a little bit about it to get that straight
__label__False ok
__label__False so
__label__False um that might actually
__label__False i trained them to uh f on about a minute or two of the one that wa already transcribed this also give me a sense of
__label__False actually if it is u
__label__False right i mean we we we were doing
__label__False but i think i need someone who know more about mike than i do because i could nt find a single other model that seemed like it would fit the connector which seems really unlikely to me
__label__False snack action
__label__False i mean i think that uh one of the thing that hynek wa talking about wa understanding what wa in the other really good proposal and and trying to see if what should ultimately be proposed is some uh combination of thing
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh god
__label__False eight five five eight five five eight six nine one
__label__False if we c if we could look at it while we re talking i think it d be uh
__label__False so now i think we should maybe have at least one navigational task with with sort of explicit uh not ex it s implicit that the person want to enter and maybe some task where it s more or le explicit that the person want to take a picture or see it or something
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False that make it g
__label__False there s no there s no lock when you check something out not like rcs
__label__False so if you wanted to have a new type of action you d create a new type of category
__label__False that s on digit
__label__False and you can do some uh you know firstorder thing about it which is to have people move it uh uh a away from being just directly in front of the middle but not too far away
__label__False i guess it yeah they re sort of succinct and and they uh
__label__False demo
__label__False well they
__label__False maybe they tres hole are on basis of this
__label__False well this
__label__False so
__label__False hey dave
__label__False i mean there s a there s change across several turn of discourse so
__label__False i would do a phone um phone recognition experiment um somehow putting in the the uh the perfect knowledge that i have about voicing
__label__False yeah exactly the
__label__True ok transcription uh microphone issue
__label__False but at after they ve given one utterance you ve got something you can compute your mean cepstra from that and then can use it for the next thing that they say uh so that you know the performance should be better that second time
__label__False digit
__label__False o seven three eight zero eight six nine one two o two
__label__False right
__label__False the easy way is yeah i know no yeah
__label__False well we have to sort of check that out that s
__label__False yeah
__label__False well i m no we may be in the same position and i figured we ll try because that ll at least get u to the point where we have we have this really nice database format that andreas and i were working out that
__label__False it go from this uh try to go it backwards this at this point it s two mixture per state
__label__False that
__label__False well we ve got ta wait until after di after we take the mike off
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep
__label__False so it s
__label__False um then there is um the neural network which use nine frame so it add forty millisecond
__label__False uh i i m i m slightly confused what what feed the uh the threeoutput net
__label__False that would be a good first pas
__label__False that doe nt follow
__label__False i do nt think so
__label__False and well normalizing
__label__False s oh yeah sunday yeah
__label__False so maybe
__label__False that s another thing you could do yeah yeah
__label__False you know actually what all that we would
__label__False and pick whichever s better
__label__False um i m in the process of doing it for quicknet but there s something going wrong and it s about half the speed that
__label__False uh you ll both be gone from here
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so the tourist node should be um very consistent with the context node right if you say that s more their in general what their background is
__label__False yeah
__label__False so that s fine f if we do nt need access to them
__label__False maybe not a constant but it doe nt uh do nt like to divide by the variance of that but i mean it s
__label__False i just do nt think a winnertakeall type of thing is the
__label__False alt tab
__label__False so so it s it should be just a straightforward reformatting issue of the reference so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False although the gain is pretty low
__label__False i mean they re much better than they were you know
__label__False and then um from the point of view of the frontend research it would be s uh substituting for htk
__label__False oh so this is trained on timit
__label__False that is to say use you know a a you re doing with the speech uh nonspeech use some very general feature
__label__False yeah but
__label__False ok so the ideal task um will have whatever
__label__False but i mean i mean train the net only on
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um the number o of mfcc that wa were used wa different you used thirteen and we used fifteen
__label__False you mean from the actual uh recording
__label__False they they should really should nt there s no particular reason why they would be exactly behave exactly the same
__label__False yeah so basically take these three thing and then put them into another beliefnet
__label__False how did he
__label__False i mean there s it s
__label__False no
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False s sixtyfour
__label__False and if it s you do go to three language including the english it s something like one point three
__label__False well we we obtain the mean for each gaussian and the variance
__label__False great
__label__False yeah
__label__False right now i m looking at jane and talking now i m looking at chuck and talking i do nt think the microphone would pick up that difference
__label__False that wa that
__label__False and then and then later we can uh replace it with
__label__False uh it s
__label__False ok
__label__False but if it is then the top block is sort of like um you know you have to list exactly what xschema or in this action schema there ll be a certain one that ha it own s structure and maybe it ha stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching but those could include role like the thing that you re viewing the thing that you re entering the thing that you re whatever you know that which are think think of enter view and approach a frame and they have framespecific parameter and and role and you can also describe them in a general way a sourcepathgoal schema and maybe there s other image schema that you could you know add after this that you know how do they work in term of you know a force dynamic or how do they work in f term of other thing so all of those have um basically f either specific frame specific role or more general frame specific role that might have binding so the question is are um how to represent when thing are linked in a certain way
__label__False with two an two hundred and seventy
__label__False now but of course this doe raise the possibility of allowing um an extra annotation for you know alternative interpretation of a stretch
__label__False hmm
__label__False we do nt care what what tool you use
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False um
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False so it like i mean
__label__False ok i i
__label__False doe there some kind of a distance metric that they use or how do they for cla what do they do for classification
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False can i i c i
__label__False yeah i thought it had to be a joke of your part you know like johno made it up i m sure
__label__False now
__label__False what
__label__False but um
__label__False well yeah or just if you re if you ha if there are meeting here that happen that we can record even if we do nt um have them do the digit or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like if it wa you know uh one string of digit or something they d probably be willing to do
__label__False yeah so if we have if i
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__True yeah i see this is this is getting into ami s thing
__label__False hmm
__label__False d
__label__False yeah
__label__False so doe anybody know what the frequency characteristic is
__label__False yeah we only want th useless thing yeah no why do nt we talk about practical thing sure
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i think we re alright um not much problem with that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no
__label__False yeah
__label__False i um uh started working on the uh
__label__False and uh uh with something that s still relatively realistic it s still very very hard to do very well
__label__False and so forth so basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge but if it s nine nine pm in the evening then the discotheque question would be for example one that might ask for direction instead of just location
__label__False so that would be even that would nt change this number down here to sixtytwo
__label__False and just have a marking
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False cep
__label__False oh yeah yeah yeah they re in the yeah if you do a pmake
__label__False particularly if if um what you re purist about doe nt actually work is real hard
__label__False so one form of different data wa is from different language but the other
__label__False did we need to do these thing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so we ll have to evaluate that when they come in and get people s opinion on on what they think of them
__label__False on what test set
__label__False oh ok
__label__False sometimes they re truly ambiguous and um uh um nice to have a notation for that but yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False transcript l dash three five two
__label__False but uh not clear what will go on
__label__False yeah no it s interesting uh w we have nt had anybody work with it before so it s interesting to get your get your feedback about it
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh yeah i m sorry
__label__False although we could tell them we could tell them if you hear someone reading a digit string just say
__label__False yeah
__label__False and so you have to be sure to pause between each line since we re going to be segmenting it and then doing it that way
__label__True yeah so i mean i think we d wan na standardize there would nt we
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and th it s and because you do nt know how people are gon na put them on you know
__label__False it s i think it s whitening
__label__False um he used uh um uh a a beliefnet where the lower level of the beliefnet are correspond to individual test of whether there is sonorance within this critical band and then at an upperlevel um there s like this soft or gate so if so if yeah yeah
__label__False so the i this idea of trying to find filter with shorter delay
__label__False and just a long a we have a little warning
__label__False if we trusted the gothere node more th much more than we trusted the other one then we would conclude even in this situation that he wanted to go there
__label__False well that would be pretty tight i in the machine room
__label__False ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False good
__label__False for the italian data
__label__False yeah
__label__False lee you liked that l huh
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh i see
__label__False yep
__label__False why
__label__False yeah
__label__False so yeah it s really uh white noise i th
__label__False no they make mistake
__label__False there is ten that come from the lda filter also right
__label__False yeah
__label__False but but it and it s pejorative with respect to a certain purpose i understand i i wanted to raise the issue
__label__False ok
__label__False four six nine three one three three six four six
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False j
__label__False what is this qual whispering
__label__False oh you ve got the parser done
__label__False oh
__label__False mmm
__label__False oh wow
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh ok yeah so the only
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so so if we e e even just had a a it sound like w we we almost do
__label__False what if we give people you know we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something
__label__False um
__label__False ok we seem to be recording
__label__False wa nt there some experiment you were gon na try where you did something differently for each um uh i do nt know whether it wa each mel band or each uh um fft bin or someth there wa something you were gon na uh some parameter you were gon na vary depending on the frequency
__label__False yes
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh so uh that s probably something wrong with the feature that we get from ogi
__label__False it s a novel idea
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we we did nt no we w
__label__False oh ok
__label__False and you and what we wanted to try with you know once we have this paper written and have a little more time uh t cloning that reject model and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the reject in the foreground like fragment and stuff and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker
__label__False yeah
__label__False whereas we could say other people you know these people are allowed to actually submit change
__label__False yeah
__label__False what the how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz let s say
__label__False um
__label__False doe that make sense
__label__False i mean like close to the end we were like uh you know we were like uh really adhoc
__label__False yeah that s it that wa it
__label__False yeah we we can try and look at that together
__label__False ok well if there is anyway
__label__False well
__label__False yeah
__label__False well what i wa gon na do is i wa gon na take um a couple of the utterance that he had run through then run them through again but modify the pruning threshold and see if it you know affect the score
__label__False yeah
__label__False huh
__label__False so
__label__False right
__label__False w
__label__False uh
__label__True yeah it seems like you should try to make your baseline a good a possible
__label__False mmm
__label__False but i it turn out not to be in an any of the contract and s deliberately
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so sometimes it is nt right and wrong sometimes it s multiple interpretation and
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False so for my class project i m um
__label__False ri you d like so you re saying you could practically turn this structure inside out or something or
__label__False um
__label__False two eight o three o seven nine eight two six
__label__False yeah what i mean is it s it s like in the hubfive evaluation you know and you read the system description and everybody s got you know lda on their feature and so uh
__label__False there s no
__label__False well i think this is what you were explaining the noise condition is the same
__label__False i guess i ll agree to that then
__label__False i m out of sort now
__label__False right otherwise you just count up the total number of beep
__label__False now for instance uh it s i think very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal s side and then for the server s side say here s a number of thing that could be done
__label__False oh well
__label__False i i mean if you re interested in speaker overlapping other speaker and not the other kind of nonspeech that s not a problem right
__label__False a i said who know
__label__False so even without an a ana anaphora somebody ha to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here
__label__False cuz i read halfway but i did nt see a castle thing
__label__False mmm
__label__False so one thing that we were thinking wa by doing the layer like this
__label__False ok
__label__False probably yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False i mean just exactly this sort of thing of you know why why these feature seem to be behaving differently uh in california than in oregon
__label__False i see
__label__False and um
__label__False two output
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah i di i did nt intend it an a policy though
__label__False oh i you want audio or do you want transcript
__label__False yeah this would be ok we we we think that this ha spike on it so it s not a good acoustically but
__label__False simultaneous one ok
__label__False continue
__label__False so you tried the global klt before and it did nt really
__label__False and then tell them to talk naturally
__label__False hhh damn this headset
__label__False so that uh now we have to worry about privacy we have to worry about all these password for different people
__label__False oh yeah it s not written anywhere yeah it s tidigits the first r spreadsheet is tidigits
__label__False yeah
__label__False right that that sometimes it might be better to do that
__label__False i will find eh eh a good eh parameter eh to detect overlapping i would like to to to test these parameter eh with the another eh eh acoustic event to nnn to eh to find what is the ehm the false eh the false eh hypothesis eh nnn which eh are produced when we use the the ehm this eh parameter eh i mean pitch eh eh difference eh feature
__label__False yeah so this is this is like the first proposal the proposal one it wa fortyfour actually
__label__False mmm
__label__False the idea is that we just extract those feature from them so we do nt actually have a node for the entire parse because we d never do inference on it anyway so
__label__False i m looking forward to seeing your representation that d be uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False and there are some case where there s um very little speech before you hear a beep so you hear a little bit of speech beep a little bit of speech beep
__label__False um not when we were doing this but i guess at some point we did
__label__False right so f
__label__False it could be that they will uh theirs will end up being a kind of fir first pas or something
__label__False um
__label__False jerry also said it would be he would be willing to have his group some of the ai meeting do it a well
__label__False then you do nt have to worry about the threshold and but just
__label__False so most most
__label__False so
__label__False i think we
__label__False well sri people easy to f find
__label__False when you get the mel
__label__False ok and then there s delta besides that
__label__False the how to g i wa thinking that for the asru paper we could have a section saying for smartkom we we d in we tried this approach in uh interactive system which i do nt think ha been done before
__label__False i take that back then
__label__False oh um the output of the net go into the standard h um icsi hybrid um recognizer
__label__False fairly substantially huh
__label__False and
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False yep
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i do nt know how many speaker there are and and how many speaker per utterance
__label__False yeah
__label__False that wa my intention so so s so part of the reason that i wanted to bring this up is do we wan na handle it a a special case or do we wan na fold it in we give everyone who s involved a their own user id give it session id let all the tool that handle meeting recorder handle it or do we wan na special case it and if we were gon na special case it who s gon na do that
__label__False officially yeah
__label__False it s a it s a technical term
__label__False we should
__label__False so um my impression is they also did very well on on the the uh evaluation set but um i i we have nt seen youve you have nt seen any final result for that yeah
__label__False and
__label__False right
__label__False or audio file
__label__False right
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so yeah i asked sunil for more information about that but uh i do nt know yet
__label__False alright
__label__False why
__label__False well
__label__False javabayes doe not support that
__label__False i m just telling you what i think you just hit the button and it s like
__label__True and i guess when he come here we re gon na have to start deciding about um what do we choose from what we ve looked at to um blend with some group of thing in what they ve looked at
__label__False although i do nt know
__label__False yeah mmhmm yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False look like it
__label__False so the point were the the weight how to weight the different error rate that are obtained from different language and and condition
__label__False i i avoided that a long a i could for you guy but uh
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and chuck s on the lapel here and he also say mixed but it s at the last one and of course the aligner th aligns it everywhere else to everybody else s mixed cuz there s no adaptation yet so there s
__label__False and this is everything
__label__False i think you know what we had meant by event i guess wa uh point of overlap between speaker
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well it s even if y if you could still transcribe the word based on the farfield microphone or something you could uh still use it for say language modeling you know
__label__False yeah so is it cuz with any luck there ll actually be a a there ll be collection at columbia collection at at uw
__label__False better maybe for voiceunvoice this is for the other one i should
__label__False for
__label__False use this analysis bandwidth or something
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False or or some high number
__label__False that s what i wa saying is that that you could have each speaker could have their own tone
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False and um so they said how much is significantly better what do you and and so they said well you know you should have half the error or something that you had before
__label__False right but it seemed to me that what you were what you were getting at before wa that there is something about the difference between the original signal or the original fft and with the filter which is what and the variance wa one take uh on it
__label__False and i calculate um the spectral mean of the log magnitude spectrum over that n
__label__False it took you a long time to mark twelve minute now my suggestion wa for the other thirtythree
__label__False yeah i
__label__False eight one six four six four eight two o three
__label__False oh no wait they re the beep file yeah it s a p hundred meg they re the beep file that s right so they re smaller
__label__True yeah and dave gelbart did volunteer and since he s not here i ll repeat it to at least modify transcriber which if we do nt have something else that work i think that s a pretty good way of going
__label__False you just run a program to restore them
__label__False zero two five nine eight five one four
__label__False right i mean that s what we want to avoid
__label__False and i have i have like another unbacked i ha have another six gig which jeremy if you re not using can on xa
__label__False i think he s right yeah
__label__False well yeah but this other thing is nt perfect
__label__False uh
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False so
__label__False so we ll see how this go oh there s yet another one of the incoming first incoming firstyear graduate student who s expressed interest so we ll see how that go
__label__False uh and the fact is that for right now for the english they have weight they they combine error rate but for the other language they combine improvement
__label__False the feature the input
__label__False with the noise i have worse result that if i doe nt use it
__label__False well maybe uh since that that wa a pretty short one maybe we should talk about the ibm transcription status someone can fill in liz and andreas later uh
__label__False and i i think that it s um
__label__False interesting
__label__False and there re two aspect to it one of which is you know technical getting the coding right and making it run and uh stuff like that and the other is the actual semantics
__label__False i th i i would say they re probably they do nt have o they do nt have other thing that are taking away their time
__label__False sort of a text template but i do nt know how we can do that
__label__False between the one point one case and the one point four case i m confused
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False what d be nice is a system that reburned the cd every year
__label__False hmm cool
__label__False ok
__label__False ok um the new microphone the two new one are in
__label__False o zero two two nine three four nine five o four five five four six seven eight
__label__False zero four five seven five five five eight two eight
__label__False because that mean multiple contact every time for every single meeting every time anyone want anything
__label__False yeah do you have a patent on it
__label__False i do nt know no u maybe it s this this idea of having different online normalization um tuning for the different mfcc s
__label__False ok
__label__False you have to plug your ear or just prepare not to laugh
__label__False yeah
__label__False with with whatever it wa a month and a half or something ahead of time the only time we could find in common roughly in common wa on a saturday
__label__False hmm
__label__False alright just a second i ll be back
__label__False ok
__label__False about ibm stuff
__label__False no no synchronized digit
__label__False what you what you int what you draw you know the conclusion that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording that um i that i we have enough space and he continues like we re so ahead of the game cuz now we have builtin downsampling
__label__True so find out who they are associated with in geneva probably we re connected to them
__label__False yeah y i i wa whe w w just yesterday when i wa thinking about it um w what what we could try to do or do about it i mean if you if you get at this in this situation that you get this this negative value and you simply set it to zero or to a constant or whatever if we if we would use there a somehow um a random generator which which ha a certain distribution u not a certain yeah a special distribution we should see we we have to think about it
__label__False yeah oh yeah
__label__False mmhmm we could uh potentially so i also wanted to be sure
__label__False also uh i mean there wa just the whole notion of having multiple net that were trained on different data
__label__False so it s a lot of pragmatic there that might be beyond what you want to do
__label__False you know you basically just give two timemarked sequence of word and it computes the um the uh you know the the th it doe all the work for you
__label__False ok so we can promote enterview all all up a bit and and get rid of the uh blahblahxblah uh asterisk subaction item altogether
__label__False within the segment yep
__label__False i i i i t i t
__label__False yeah the that s true that those those region are the cause for this those negative value or whatever you get yeah
__label__False i let uh my fiveyearold have a try at the digit eh
__label__False ok
__label__False so i m i m s so what is different between this and and what you
__label__False if you give them the line and they have to touch it they ca nt
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False so um
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False how would that help
__label__False i think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh they get access to this if they really need it
__label__False yep
__label__False it s although it s like it h my machine ha it on my desk so i do get job running on my machine all the time
__label__False so so it seems like the main different there is the is the uh filtering
__label__False ok it s april fifth
__label__False per utterance yes per utterance yes and th
__label__False well
__label__False yes i m playing
__label__False and at some point i d like to get back to uh porting quicknet to the multiprocessor linux box
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you have the distance to work with yeah
__label__False then
__label__False it s like uh fff fff um ten percent relative
__label__False why do nt we
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False four zero eight six four eight nine five zero three
__label__False right right they do nt all work but the nice one the um plan plantronic one work
__label__False ok
__label__False and and your result is with the
__label__False so i have a vested interest
__label__False mmm
__label__False we have some
__label__False oh sorry ok this is on oh ok
__label__False uh p the one that they have reported is a nist evaluation wall street journal
__label__False no we did four four kind of of testing actually
__label__False the
__label__False well what i wa thinking is map all the speech to the reject model and then you have a beep model
__label__False i think you could just add it i mean i have before ok whew
__label__False i wanted to ask one other question which is a different matter which is with respect to um this thing that you ve been r working on for the recording monitoring script
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no i say if i apply log i have uh log of e is equal to log of uh in this side is equal to log of x plus n
__label__False right
__label__False no he s not gon na do that
__label__False yeah
__label__False you can specify the minimum length of speech or and silence portion which you want and so i did some some modification in those parameter basically changing the minimum minimum length for s for silence to have er to have um yeah to have more or le uh silence portion in inserted so
__label__False yeah
__label__False the equip me and adam went through it yesterday just looked at everything but it s all kind of here and set up so it s just a question of turning it all on
__label__False just in the spatial domain are rare
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False o six nine zero six zero one four two three zero five one zero eight one four zero zero four seven two two six one seven four two eight seven eight nine nine seven five nine
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah i mean that s a separate problem we do in the long run wan na do better visualization and all that stuff
__label__False um
__label__False it s not so easy to find
__label__False and it s something like one point three of of the uh
__label__False well the for the forced alignment will run fa otherwise it ll take forever i mean to really run recognition
__label__False the i agree that the consent form were uh i con agree with what adam s saying that um the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit thing which they found offensive whe whether they said them or did nt say them
__label__False i just use um our loudnessbased thing now a they before there were they were some in in the log domain and i i changed this to the to the
__label__False wi
__label__False i do nt really see the people at uw that i know of right now making huge amoun investing huge amount of time in changing transcript but i could be wrong
__label__False so i huh i i guessed that they were gon na do it some time during the semester but they ll do it any time huh
__label__False well you know uh i all i need to do is mail um send them m a mail like two day in advance so they can schedule their time
__label__False we do we tend to do that anyway
__label__False yeah i think that s right just uh
__label__False also you know did nt we have a size a one
__label__False right
__label__False ok the the pressed one last for well not forever they ve been finding even those degrade
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False it s network service and application
__label__False not a cstruct that s not what i wa trying to k though yeah
__label__False but i mean w but the other feature that you have um th the non tandem one
__label__False so at any rate you were you ve you ve done some work on that and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh area that uh we re thinking about doing
__label__False huh
__label__False i mean that that s how we found a lot of problem before with um word being on the wrong place or something
__label__False ok sh explain to me why it s necessary to distinguish between whether something ha a door and is not public
__label__False if i wa actually working on it i d sit there and and play around with it and and get a feeling for it i mean the the the uh but uh you certainly wan na use the closetalking a a at least
__label__False so suppose you did this is almost cheating it certainly is nt realtime but if y suppose you use the real boundary that that you were in fact were given by the vad and so forth th th or i i guess we re gon na be given even better boundary than that
__label__False during during digit
__label__False it s much worse
__label__False the quality is quite good or
__label__False so it s jane that we have to coordinate that through
__label__False i m actually reoptimizing them
__label__False twentyninth
__label__False and that s just amazingly helpful
__label__False i do nt know how to
__label__False it s fascinating
__label__False hmm
__label__False ah ok
__label__True well i ll dig through the documentation to dragondictate and ste s see if they still have the little form
__label__False i sort of spotchecked i wa trying to remember
__label__False yeah
__label__False a minute uh several minute ago i like briefly wa wa not listening and
__label__False yeah so the final d decision is the combination of these three so again it s it s some kind of uh
__label__False uh we can write that the estimation of the clean speech is equal at an expected value of the clean speech conditional to uh the noise signal the probability f of the the statistic of the clean speech and the statistic of the noise
__label__False and then also should we go ahead and get another wireless system
__label__False just instead of the sequential number for perhaps just the speaker id or something just say speaker one or spea or just one two three four for four speaker or something
__label__False that s right
__label__False well
__label__False ok we ve got twenty minute so we should probably try to move along
__label__False if i found an error and i sent them email and said here s this error and i did nt get a response for a couple week
__label__False and then each meeting we ll only allow the participant who were at that meeting to look at it
__label__False so yeah i ve been exploring a parallel vad without neural network with like le latency using snr and energy um after the cleaning up
__label__False so they have the trajectory are very very similar and and
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False jrasta seems to perform better with the highly mismatched condition but slightly slightly worse for the well matched condition
__label__False s
__label__False yeah
__label__False he s i think that he is in la vega or something like that
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah but there is probably a a big change that will be made is that the the baseline th they want to have a new baseline perhaps which is um mfcc but with a voice activity detector
__label__False the train on twelve second
__label__False yeah yeah yeah yeah
__label__False at twenty hertz
__label__False oh you know or what if there wa an error in the transcript that did nt get detected and there wa a whole uh i segment a against some personal i th
__label__False ok
__label__False and uh
__label__False because there may be other consideration that will go into the design i mean uh our getting some experience with this may help to determine some of thing that are i do nt know might change this design
__label__False and what it doe is it it copy um
__label__True yeah so i think it s not worth going over in the group but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either robert or johno or i can walk you through it
__label__False yeah
__label__False well but they wo nt get that feedback
__label__False and callhome
__label__False so it s it s not really an excitation but it s something that hopefully tell you something about the excitation
__label__False right
__label__False i see
__label__False so which would mean that if we estimate the mean based on all the signal even though we have frame dropping but we do nt frame ev uh drop everything but uh this can hurt the estimation of the mean for speech and
__label__False i wo did they compare that i mean what if you just did phone recognition and did the reverse lookup
__label__False and then
__label__False well my
__label__False could could be helpful
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__True i sent it to um who did i send that to i sent it to a list and i thought i sent it to the e to the local list you saw that
__label__False ah great
__label__False yeah yeah e
__label__False th what i thought
__label__False i wa thinking that the the the reason is maybe because of these funny thing that happen between speech and silence which have different mean
__label__False mmm
__label__False it s a needle good idea is that the idea ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False you ll have y this is what you get
__label__False i
__label__False i guess we need to hook it to the network so we can get the file to it but
__label__False yeah we actually trained uh the on the italian training part we we had another system with u
__label__False yeah
__label__False it would
__label__False and more are supposed to come soon and there s only a moderate amount of dat of memory so i do nt think anybody ha been sufficiently excited by it to spend much time uh with it but uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s just so m w
__label__False i should nt be saying this but you can just you know since the backup are every night you can recycle the backedup diskspace
__label__False so we would be looking at um the variance of the spectrum of the excitation something like this which is should be high for voiced sound
__label__False so why doe that m smooth thing out i do nt i do nt understand that
__label__False right
__label__False channel four
__label__False so whose vad is is is this a
__label__False yeah
__label__False so that mean we ca nt um save meeting data either right
__label__False but um i i think we should leave japanese construction maybe outside of the scope for for now but um definitely it s interesting to look at at cross the bordered there
__label__False i swi i tried the trap eh triangular one
__label__False you end up with a similar difference over here
__label__False should you go back to the first one
__label__False there re too there re all sort of fixed expression i do nt like uh
__label__False oh yeah you re right yeah
__label__False that s forty minute
__label__False is that the reason
__label__False so we re gon na end up with these same kind of sheet that have the the percentage and so on just for the
__label__False uh in this case four
__label__False yeah
__label__False and in fact that s part of what ha to be done this is why there s this interaction between the analysis and the construal
__label__False yeah
__label__False how are we doing on
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean so if i just read that dan wa saying we re ahead of the game in that in that context
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah you could do fancy thing but it seems like that s enough
__label__False um no idea then
__label__True i had nt heard back from mari after i i u u uh brought up the point abou about andreas s schedule so um maybe when i get back there ll be some some mail from her
__label__False right
__label__False and generally i it s allows you to transmit like fifteen uh cepstrum
__label__False yeah
__label__False what are some type of action schema well one of the type of action schema is sourcepathgoal action
__label__False i mean it s it s uh um
__label__True yeah sixteenth eighteenth
__label__False i think it would save them time i think it would help them keep the track track of it
__label__False so i wo nt do that anymore
__label__False yeah right
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False and that s how we do
__label__False reference i have nt done it yet
__label__False i just had one of the most frustrating meeting of my career
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah and the other thing well there are other issue maybe for the tandem like uh well do we want to w uh n
__label__False he ha this on his board actually
__label__False ok so whatever people sort of wear to use l yeah something like tha with their cell phone it d be really great i think if we can argue t that people like that
__label__False it s
__label__False ok
__label__False so h
__label__False i agree and mari also we had this came up when she she wa here that s important
__label__False two eight six two zero two one eight one
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um and then it go to a real wizard and they re evaluating that and they wanted to use this equipment and so the w question came up is well here s some more data should this be part of the corpus or not
__label__False yeah and there s also the minor matter it d be kind of nice to able to bring people in and say yes this is where we do suchandsuch and then be able to see uh you know some kind of i mean it s le important than doing what we re doing right now but
__label__False and that way each person only ha to remember one password
__label__False and so we could replace our wired mike with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mike
__label__False do you guy oh yeah so part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when when he come back
__label__False i think a far a this group go um it s certainly worth continuing for the next few week to get closure on the uh beliefnet and the idea that are involved in that and what are th what are the concept
__label__False but i m sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or or some thing
__label__False that s good to know
__label__False get get rid of the sort of spg slash something uh or the subactions category because what doe that tell u
__label__False hiccup
__label__False it s some sort of oversampling thing i imagine right
__label__False but the demo doe nt work very well
__label__False anyway it s just an idea um
__label__False ha
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False are we only half i thought we were more than that
__label__False so i mean that s the easy way they might have a more complex setup at ibm i ve seen digital digital analog tape where it s controlled by the computer
__label__False that s right yeah so
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False yeah you would know that
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False well maybe i m not understanding where this come from and where this go to what are we doing with this
__label__False and the other one is what about transcription
__label__False well it sort of depends on on if you actually write down the the schema then you have to say it s either one of them or it can be none or it can be any of them however the uh it seems to be sensible to me to r to view them a mutually exclusive um maybe even not
__label__False well with the beep model is what s really you d have really g it would be really good though so so it s p so it s really just doing yeah a keyword like a spotting for beep with
__label__False but of course he doe nt use window
__label__False oh no
__label__False yeah i have yeah
__label__False so
__label__False but it it seems to me that u um it doe import some negative evaluation that um would maybe not be good if it ha shock value and to the wr to the wrong audience i think that that might be t a negative shock
__label__False ok
__label__False i see
__label__False yeah so you you were get
__label__False what s it trained on
__label__False so they re fairly you know hefty model and hynek wa saying that well probably in a real application you would nt have enough compute to handle model that are very big or complicated
__label__False final wa that
__label__False oh
__label__False somebody need to zap that
__label__False i beg your pardon
__label__False yeah
__label__False having access to it doe nt necessarily mean that having it right it just mean they have the right to have it
__label__False yeah the the th
__label__False i made that joke already nancy sadly the i do nt know myself joke
__label__False and we have five we re getting one more
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False whenever you re ready
__label__False yes
__label__False or yeah right
__label__False fixed
__label__False um
__label__False and the reason is um if i understand that
__label__False yeah i think so too
__label__False four eight four three four seven five one eight five nine eight
__label__False mmhmm that s right and with the right in interface
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False the
__label__False oh they wo nt
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False if we do need her for the technical stuff then of course one of you ha to sort of uh jump in
__label__False i have something just fairly brief to report on
__label__False o six one five three six three nine one one
__label__False yeah but i did not uh do that we
__label__False yeah
__label__False and it ha one hundred hidden unit
__label__False yeah
__label__False she s she s serious she is serious
__label__False so um
__label__False yeah
__label__False so can i ask can i ask whether you found uh you know how accurate uh jane s uh uh label were a far a you know did she miss some overlap or did she n
__label__False right
__label__False but you know i do nt know whether it s which one are safer you know statistically
__label__False yeah
__label__False the thing wa i wa hoping that we could in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect you know thirty to fifty hour
__label__False with timit ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it it is
__label__False well it never went all the way right i mean you always had to change train at omaha right
__label__False but since we can only deal with a finite amount of stuff
__label__False well no i i m i
__label__False every noun is a construction
__label__False we have to ask them
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False maybe we can take it offline but i i do nt know
__label__False i take that frame and four f the four i take sorry i take the current frame and the four past frame and the four future frame and that add up to six second of speech
__label__False i remember the date so
__label__False yeah
__label__True ok well holiday may have interrupted thing cuz in in in they seem to want to get absolutely clear on standard for transcription standard and so forth with with u
__label__False well i mean my argument here is it s it s it s the same thing a plato s on the top shelf i m con you know th that you can refer to a book of plato by using plato and you can refer back to it and so you can castle have a tourist site have admission fee so you can say where is the castle how much doe it cost
__label__False yeah but those are folded in and it s just you just mark the transcript differently so so one option is you fold it in and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction rather than another type of interaction
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ye
__label__False yeah
__label__False the person at the screen is trying to communicate some abstract idea like
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right i mean there s a whole sort of dis right we right
__label__False i see
__label__False yeah right
__label__False right eh or w but we really ca nt work on that problem we do nt have time we re not interested or w whatever
__label__False yeah so um
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False i see
__label__False so there are there wa like some problem in balancing the deletion and insertion when i try different threshold so
__label__False yep
__label__False that s interesting
__label__False right even with one microphone
__label__False and then it s it get worse with the multilingual
__label__False and i m really interested in this but we do nt have a whole lot of data so i wa thinking you know we ve got the room set up and you can always think of also for political reason if icsi collected you know two hundred hour that look different than forty hour even if we do nt transcribe it ourselves so
__label__False well that s maybe why they do nt f know that they have a crummy system i mean a crummy backend
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False yep
__label__False yes uh
__label__False is that ok
__label__False no because uw want to have access to these file that s the whole point
__label__False um for example i they ll say uh ninetytwo and you know so how you could e exactly so if you just say nine two the there are many s way that could have been expressed an and i just had them
__label__False yeah
__label__False well we ll see what it it s like that tha that can be quite good
__label__False wh uh the the vad what
__label__False can i s
__label__False but not for i mean for matched and the clean condition both you get log energy
__label__False sure
__label__True there is a d is nt final coming up then pretty much after that
__label__False both training and test
__label__False hmm
__label__False it s not
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah the same sort of number that we got those graph from right
__label__False right
__label__False those transcriptionists need to know their place
__label__False i see what you mean
__label__False yeah thank you
__label__False that s on digit it c it it could h it could have something to do with um downsampling that s that s worth looking into
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False ok
__label__False very helpful
__label__False h how many total have we recorded now altogether
__label__False yep
__label__False x time one plus uh
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah we can do it this week
__label__False one four two five two two seven zero three one
__label__False hey adam this is barry
__label__False yeah if you can get it to
__label__False s so i do nt know i wa h i m i m i m like that so that is the next thing once this i once i sort this pro uh problem out maybe i ll just go into that also
__label__False what s that
__label__False well i think what we wan na do is we want to eh and we ve talked about this in other context we want to have the ability to feed it different feature
__label__False so you have two set of thing that are kind of uncorrelated uh within themselves but they re pretty correlated with one another
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False i think
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False mmm uh
__label__False but that
__label__False yeah
__label__False and i think part of part of his motivation with this is that he s trying to help u out in the because of uh the fact that the meeting are are tending to become reasonably large now on day when everybody show up and so he figure he could help that out by not showing and and i m sure help out his own time by not showing up if it s a meeting that he s he s
__label__False beep
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False ok thanks
__label__False the nonbackedup yeah i is cheap i mean if we need to we can buy a disk hang it off a s uh workstation if it s not backedup the sysadmins do nt care too much
__label__False it look like there will still be some difference maybe between one and two percent um for the female and so um you know i m open to suggestion
__label__False iram
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False you can actually continuously vary it between the two and so i wen
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah th um
__label__False well it
__label__False hang on let s let s
__label__False that s wonderful
__label__False and then we should see how much of a pain it is for one of u i mean the o the other problem is you would wan na r do it on an unloaded machine
__label__False uh
__label__False made no difference whatsoever it s
__label__False yeah yeah that s fine
__label__False pruning in the
__label__False yeah
__label__False much faster mmhmm
__label__False transcript three seven nine one three eight one zero nine zero four zero two zero zero seven one one seven o four two four o nine two two one three six one three five o nine four nine five six zero six zero seven eight five six eight zero nine seven
__label__False yeah
__label__False so how did he combine all these feature what what r mmm classifier did he u
__label__False right
__label__False uh because cuz we ve had with the exception of forgetting to change the battery from time to time uh we ve really had no tr no trouble with this at all right and and the wired stuff is just gon na continue to degrade a you know and nobody will remember how to yeah nobody will remember how to repair a jimbox or a jimlet or a you know it s
__label__False i see
__label__False right but it ll it ll grab the next beep in other word it ll be
__label__False it s more like you say i want to uh i want to do an enter and then you re more interested in knowing what the parent category are of that
__label__False and the fourth test is uh excluding from these three language the language that is the task language
__label__False well the only other choice is that the person would say no do nt distribute this meeting at all and i would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say do nt distribute it at all
__label__False mmm yeah
__label__False so you have to sort of get the idea that um ahead of the game is sp speaking with respect to space limitation that um that in fact downsampling is gaining u enough space and that therefore we can keep the recording we ve done so far
__label__False from this you would say well it doe nt really matter if we put finnish into the training of the neural net if there s gon na be you know finnish in the test data right
__label__False i understand what you mean
__label__False um we do nt have headset though
__label__False it s strangely satisfying
__label__False yeah
__label__False it is true that tec that the content is technical i and so i and we re not having these discussion which
__label__False are the sp s optional i mean skip them
__label__False yeah
__label__False actually i had a question about that if you find that you can lower the false alarm that you get where there s no speech that would be useful for u to know so um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False what did you think he wa doing
__label__False oh wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on hold on let me give you a black screen
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False not a rich language
__label__False i mean it s always gon na give u a value of how likely we think i it is that he want to go there and doe nt want to go there or how likely it is that he want to get information
__label__False yeah
__label__False so look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for the icsiogi frontend
__label__False right
__label__False so it s not done basically
__label__False actually actually w w the the we do this i dunno who came up with it but i think it s a really clever idea
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i checked them this morning they should be
__label__False yeah
__label__False so is that it
__label__False it s like friendly it allows you enter thing well
__label__False and um the the sem semester will be over next week but then you have project for one more week to come
__label__False and we have done that on the automatic segmentation
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah a oh yeah sorry it is binary
__label__False but about the need for transcription i mean do nt we did nt we previously decide that the ibm transcript would have to be checked anyway and possibly augmented
__label__False but it ca nt be just the
__label__False i i m just looking at it the other way around
__label__False no
__label__False or will that change
__label__False hmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False that look good yeah
__label__False so we can figure this out
__label__False um but we should try to keep in mind that you know we re doing this sort of for research so we we should find a limit that s reasonable and not go you know all the way back to adam and eve
__label__False because eh for me is the is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral i do nt mind by the moment by the moment i i do nt
__label__False yeah it s alright
__label__False more than
__label__False i think the only one using it ha been javier but at this point i think it s he s only been using it for feature that he calculated quite a while ago so if nobody else is doing feature calculation
__label__False i m not sure i i thought about uh adding uh uh another class too but it s not too easy i think the the transition between the different class to model them in in the system i have now but it it it could be possible i think in principle
__label__False now i have these much better model i ll regenerate my initial alignment then i ll get much better model at the end
__label__False yeah
__label__False yes
__label__False yeah well but yeah
__label__False um no i did not
__label__False uh second thing is uh the training of uh online normalization with two different mean one mean for the silence and one for the speech
__label__False so
__label__False yeah yeah so you can r no you can run both and you can s
__label__False ok so how many of those thousand were silence
__label__False what are what are your f uh frame error rate for for this
__label__False good point
__label__False w w
__label__False where it is
__label__False and it s part of the talk itself so it s really not a big part
__label__False wa this code that you downloaded to do this or wa it
__label__False and they re mostly in english so
__label__False yep
__label__False it is
__label__False horrible
__label__False where is x and so we want to know um is doe he want info o on this or know the location
__label__False ok
__label__False well no i think he wanted u u to tell him when
__label__False sudden surprising contact right
__label__False ok
__label__True so have you used javabayes a lot
__label__False transcript l forty five
__label__False ok bye that wa a great meeting
__label__False and start by giving the transcript number
__label__False ok
__label__False uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False eh we used to do only three and then we found out we can squeeze
__label__False maybe i mean certainly it d be better
__label__False remove some noise but not too much
__label__False so i mean that would be a fine use for b for that machine
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s wideband yeah it s in in fact we looked it up and it wa actually twenty kilohertz sampling
__label__False is two hundred the d
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok well
__label__False now you can all turn off your
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False but you can control that by knowing you re making two corpus or knowing that you re adding um annotation on one version and you do nt have the latest correction maybe at that point and then you finish the project and you realize that there were correction made on your original and then you have to merge them
__label__False i guess one thing that might also be an issue uh cuz part of what you re doing is you re getting a a spectrum over a bunch of different kind of speech sound
__label__False it s it s always the wizard but it start where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it go through a uh speech generation system
__label__False which is which is the log domain
__label__False that s generally the way it s done
__label__False right
__label__False ok go ahead and read it and then fill it out
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah who know
__label__False well it could if they do a lot of it it s
__label__False but the first thing that i do nt understand is that they are using r the uh log energy that this quite i do nt know why they have some constant in the expression of the lower energy i do nt know what that mean
__label__False robert
__label__False uh but i started to play with the um uh tandem neural network
__label__False this bud s for no
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False well but
__label__False nine eight eight eight one nine eight one eight
__label__False maybe
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False i do nt know how much you d be training on
__label__False right the other other thing another issue is just getting a sound card up here
__label__False yeah that seems kind of redundant but
__label__False why do nt you want to use any of those
__label__False yeah
__label__False and there s this question of well so um in my test before with htk i found it worked it worked the best with about twelve second of data used to estimate the mean but we ll often have le in the smartkom system um
__label__False spike you mean like uh instantaneous click type spike or
__label__False great
__label__False oops
__label__False s self
__label__False and i ll mention it in my status report if people wan na take a look
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False a opposed to
__label__False uh
__label__False mmm
__label__True maybe you can send me that
__label__False we are
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah it s ok
__label__False yeah but the bayesnet that would merge
__label__False and this is out of like seven speaker so out of seven speaker four microphone
__label__False so what i m saying is the exact nature of these boot alignment is probably not a big factor in the quality of the final model
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s a different issue
__label__False rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get separation you sort of you want them very close and
__label__False yeah because that would be the easiest way
__label__False but uh we re we re basically ready to do it
__label__False mmm
__label__False well these feature actually
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh he wa gone these first few day and then he s here for a couple day before he go to salt lake city ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False twenty
__label__False yeah i um
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False oh
__label__False ok
__label__True about the um well the downsampling problem
__label__False and then we can ass it
__label__False i mean i i i do nt know what uh level of detail would be most useful i do nt know i if that s something that i should do when i look over it or if we want someone else to do or whatever
__label__False yep
__label__False which is w quite positive yeah
__label__False can we
__label__False ah
__label__False i have nt done a
__label__False yeah and everybody s putting that on their system now and so i that s what made me wonder about this but
__label__False yeah that s that s the dummy dummy pda
__label__False yeah that s true
__label__False no it would nt work it s it s not the aurora i mean it it s it s actually the aurora task
__label__False ok
__label__False i i m really into art uh
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False in
__label__False mmhmm ok
__label__False we do nt need all we do nt necessarily need it all online i mean it will be different subset so you wo nt you wo nt you know do all sixteen channel in a single
__label__False ok
__label__False an and you re gon na the you re gon na do phone recognition with that ok ok
__label__False so a long time ago people talked about thing where you would have uh a condensed nearestneighbor where you would you would you would pick out uh some representative example which would uh be sufficient to represent to to correctly classify everything that came in
__label__False it work like this the uh um
__label__False uh maybe at this stage we will we do want to uh sort of get uh modifier in there because they may also tell u whether the person is in a hurry or not
__label__True well uh first we discussed about some of the point that i wa addressing in the mail i sent last week
__label__False i m in trouble
__label__False right it s a
__label__False oh well that sound pretty easy
__label__False cuz viewing in a tourist domain is going up to it and or actually going from one place to another to take a picture in this in a
__label__False cuz you have score for that for the other case and
__label__False but ok this is just something we ll we ll see um
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh well
__label__False maybe we ought to switch off these thing before we continue
__label__False yeah it s just writing conversion tool from the format that the aligner
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah well
__label__False a which one i which one are important
__label__False dd s full that wa the first one
__label__False a far a i remember you you smooth somehow the envelope you smooth somehow the noise estimate and and later on you smooth also this subtraction factor
__label__False uh you know that s what i had thought
__label__False right
__label__False we do nt have this ninetythree seventyeight we have eight yeah
__label__False were you using the the normalization in addition to this i mean what wa the rest of the system
__label__False yeah
__label__False so first read the transcript number and then start reading the digit
__label__False you have the log magnitude spectrum and you were looking at that and the difference between the filter bank and and c c computing the variance
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False but i think one thing is that uh i would presume
__label__False i will read because it s better for my english
__label__False interesting
__label__False eight six zero three one zero nine seven five three
__label__False we re talking about which which version we re using for evaluating the recognition which version of the transcript
__label__True well there there is a term that s often used that s saliency or the salience of an object
__label__False eh um eh in the in the measurement uh the average uh dividing by the by the um variance
__label__False specifically in the nsa one and i noticed that when i tried to uh uh generate the transcript for nsa that there are a few with no speaker form
__label__False um
__label__False mmm
__label__False so we re thinking about um or we could also think about uh
__label__False fulltime yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah yeah no well that s a good idea
__label__False the the mel cepstrum
__label__False right what s it trained on
__label__False um ok yeah so let s back up because you were nt here for an earlier conversation
__label__False uh not here no i have s but not here
__label__False it s throwing out chunk of frame yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh or is there some adaptation
__label__False so this the this uh the sluggishness of the loading is all due to the parsing of the xml format right
__label__False um essentially you re adding a constant into everything
__label__False um
__label__False so
__label__False that i think that s
__label__False four input
__label__False just hacking dan s code and m stepping through it but i think it s close
__label__False w w if if
__label__False the frame
__label__False well there there re a couple different of doing it we could use the tool i ve already developed and transcribe it hire some people or use the transcriber to do it we could let ibm transcribe it
__label__False were were you basically done with the transcription part
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False an adaptor might be a better idea than do redoing the wiring all the time
__label__False and liz can look at it and see if she want anything else
__label__False yep yep
__label__False how do i how do i come at this question
__label__False yeah
__label__False i um
__label__False oh yeah yeah
__label__False i see
__label__False so actually we re gon na h start having a a pretty significant chunk and so you know adam s sort of struggling with trying to get thing to be le buggy and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff thing like that now that uh the thing are starting to happen
__label__False and these are very observable sort of from the from the ontology sort of thing
__label__False ok make sense
__label__False and you just happened to have picked a particular one by setting all the weight to be equal
__label__False that s that s really neat
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False i mean this wa something that we were talking about we could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five time
__label__False yeah
__label__False and in fact it is it is it is sensitive i i came up with something from the human subject people that i wanted to mention i mean it fit into the m area of the mundane but they did say
__label__False yep
__label__False i would maybe go with one second i do nt know it s a
__label__False of oz
__label__False ok
__label__False i think two second mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False excellent
__label__False it s eee messy but once you understand it you understand it it s it s there s nothing really complicated about it
__label__False so it it it ha currently about four gig on the drive that i think she s going to put it on um
__label__False uh and in that twenty percent it s very inconsistent across different noise condition so i have like a fortyfive percent for car noise and then there s a minus five percent for the babble and there s this thirtythree for the station
__label__False i could say a little bit about w stuff i ve been playing with
__label__False and you have to record every channel separately
__label__False that would be ft quick since i think he did it in matlab
__label__False right because they re they re presumably going to start recording next month
__label__False nine seven three seven five nine seven seven two three
__label__False right
__label__False if you extrapolate the speechdatcar wellmatched and mediummismatch it s around yeah maybe five
__label__False but yeah if they recycle through
__label__False and the way to do this is that well we have the we have the fft because it s computed in in the in the system and we have the mel filter bank and so if we if we like remove the mel filter bank from the fft we have something that s close to the excitation signal
__label__False so how much ha it cost to enter and the answer is two hundred fifty dollar and then the person say um yeah i want to see it
__label__False yep
__label__False this is for the lda
__label__False n
__label__True what doe that stand for
__label__False well we re g we re gon na automate that my intention is to do a script that ll do everything
__label__False and it doe have two processor you know and
__label__False mmhmm ok sure
__label__False yeah
__label__False six one one one eight two four s two six
__label__False i think that i i i think that for the other one for the three output is sixty sixtytwo sixty three more or le it s
__label__False and andre andreas your your microphone s a little bit low
__label__False what s interesting is it s exactly what um i in discussing with um sue about this um she um i i i indicated that that you know that s very important for overlap analysis
__label__False well u i
__label__False hhh oy
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh um
__label__False yeah and so i think it s just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it s face to face
__label__False yeah
__label__False so the only status ite well first of all we h have nt decided whether we re
__label__False plus mayb
__label__False and maybe someone ha two for the italian because
__label__False uhhuh if you have clean training you get also a fifty percent improvement
__label__False yeah
__label__False without thinking too hard um maybe yeah of course um opera premier
__label__False uh three month from now
__label__False i just
__label__False um the additional thing is i guess learning the probability also
__label__False did uh did everybody sign these consent
__label__False so they re set they re setting it based on that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well anyway for this this recording we re fine cuz we re only we re only how many mike are we recording right now
__label__False that s great
__label__False three six one three six nine oops three seven nine four o seven
__label__False two nine nine four three two eight seven eight seven four two
__label__False and if that s not consistent with other thing then you ve got ta reject that reading
__label__False just what do we do with digit we have so many of them and it d be nice to actually do something with them
__label__False yeah
__label__False right and that that included a fair amount of fiddling around since it s it s more or le the first time we ve tried to do it
__label__False i mean i i thought that you were maybe i misinterpreted what you said but it s
__label__False yeah do we have to time them at the same time or just overlapping
__label__False ok
__label__False i can share with barry
__label__False where you could send them audio file over the web and they send you back text file over the web i should look that up again
__label__False this is these are thing we will find out
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and actually i wa cuz i got a wireless mike on
__label__False what if i were what if i were to call you eva
__label__False i mean i you could argue about whether it should be linear interpolation or or or or zeroeth order but but at any rate something like this is what you re feeding your recognizer typically
__label__False right
__label__False just uh
__label__False that s really great
__label__False feature i see
__label__False right
__label__False and we re off
__label__False no so the the that s the that s the biggest one uh chunk so far but there s at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guy
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and these artificial distortion uh i have the feeling that they are the reason why why we have the problem in this multicondition training
__label__False yeah there there is a difference actually with b between plp and jrasta is that
__label__False actually there is one thing that well
__label__False maybe yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False are you saying that all of these estimate are done using um estimate of the probability density for the noise that are calculated only from the first ten frame
__label__False i mean because if i object to the conversation if i say
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and they find that the the spectrum between one and sixteen hertz in the modulation is uh is im important for speech recognition
__label__False and it s night
__label__False yeah and then put it in correctly and see how much that help i mean i wa just thinking do the one that s easiest first because you wan na know how much that s helping you in these case anyhow
__label__False alright
__label__False and then you know somebody ne either the computer or the user say alright well i know i want to do a sourcepathgoal action so what are my choice among that
__label__True yeah so i ll i ll the next experiment i m gon na try is to just um you know create uh model that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so this is like yeah fifty millisecond or something like that
__label__False it s interesting that um it m it s not clear whether it s better to have them written a a word or or figure
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False do you do you know nancy ok
__label__False ba based on some of the tran uh i
__label__False that s interesting
__label__False yeah so they they they have this they re working on the database it s still it s still being being uh transcribed and produced
__label__False um
__label__False yeah they re all genderdependent so we would have to at least do that
__label__False so that the
__label__False right but it ha one the first column ha the meeting name so it could actually contain several meeting um
__label__False so you re saying that when you train on english and uh and and test on
__label__False it s the back it s the backup capaci yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False because then if they have one off then then it would only screw up that file
__label__False so i might maybe look at is it due to the fact that um the probability of the silence at the output of the network is uh too too high or
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it may or may not be a just a pain it s it s
__label__False huh
__label__False um
__label__False um how re we doing on the on the rest of it
__label__False well that s more open than i realized
__label__False or overlooked or not overlooked
__label__False you mean you wan na cheat
__label__False good point yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False well th r well there there s only one person who it can be because they own that microphone i m just wondering there s
__label__False is there any word yet about the issue about um adjustment for different feature set or anything
__label__False but is it better than nothing
__label__False and so i think it wa it wa it wa very important for people then who were doing something diagnostic to say hey i know i m doing something that is nt kosher
__label__False i think it would be because they would know their place yeah
__label__False um the uh
__label__False right
__label__False now it s technically possible that you can fit schema within schema and schema within schema
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah that s a good point
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think you re gon na find a substantial gain in term of the word ac accuracy
__label__False yeah um
__label__False yeah silent ground to bec to detect eh because i consider acoustic event all the thing are not eh speech
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False so when you look at the trajectory of cone it s ha a strange shape and
__label__False ok
__label__False u that s pretty good i think yeah thanks
__label__False but you know that s just
__label__False to use clean speech
__label__False it s good to delegate
__label__False so ok
__label__False well so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere a little a possible with their choice of word uh uh
__label__False but if you only had your pda sitting in front of you
__label__False twoseventy
__label__False so it s a n neural network based on plp parameter uh which estimate silence probability and then
__label__False oh
__label__False so so i guess don would need your help to to create a new set of split uh meeting
__label__False one one thing i do nt understand is if you have the data if if you if the meeting data is put on disk exactly once then it s backedup once and the backup system should never have to bother with it uh more than once
__label__True yeah so i think hynek will be here monday
__label__False yeah so
__label__False right
__label__False cuz it s not remote
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False nine eight two four seven one eight one nine nine
__label__False or you can yeah you can use the one with one second or whatever i i i there s no not much difference between the the onesecond and the twosecond one
__label__False so i i i do nt understand because i
__label__False now why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the i mean you should nt need to do this p completely by hand right
__label__False either thi this is test with uh the same language but from the broad data or it s test with uh different language also from the broad data excluding the
__label__False which are plp or something
__label__False d do the lapel mike have any directionality to them
__label__False so inst replacing the beep with twenty three
__label__False transcript l dash one six eight
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um still working on my my quals preparation stuff
__label__False yeah so the only difference would be we would be putting the stuff on tape versus ibm
__label__False or anything else
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False three eight zero four five zero four three four seven
__label__False i know that s probably a good enough test of
__label__False oh
__label__False yes
__label__False so who is he in this context
__label__False right
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False this way we we worked around that
__label__False so so we get this whole list of of um thing and the question is what to do with it what to hand on how to interpret it in a sense
__label__False yeah i i um have i have no
__label__False that s
__label__False what would you do i mean
__label__False the combination yeah but i have nt result at this moment
__label__False the effect i do nt
__label__False uh
__label__False can use the oprah mike
__label__False sure
__label__False so
__label__False but not digit i mean it s
__label__False well
__label__False we have f a big im so the major improvement that we got wa in all the high mismatch case because all those number were in sixty and seventy because we never had any noise compensation
__label__False seven o nine six nine
__label__False cuz we had nt really done much with tandem system for larger stuff
__label__False did anybody uh do anything with the model a a an experiment or
__label__False touristy landmark also happen to be
__label__False eh no
__label__False so this is something that you know may also be a re a a result of your work in the future we may find out that you know there re really s these subtle difference between um even within the domain of entering in the light of a sourcepathgoal schema that we need to put in fill in additional structure up there
__label__False might be closer i guess if we did a soft soft target uh uh embedded neural net training like we ve done a few time uh f the forward um do the forward calculation to get the gamma and train on those
__label__False uh this way and just slightly to the left yeah
__label__False you know so i just e edited out the first i uh word of the utterance
__label__True uh maybe raise the issue of microphone uh um procedure with reference to the cleanliness of the recording
__label__False i d handle the number individually
__label__False based upon
__label__False so you know all this time we spent on it s gon na be thirty second of screen time
__label__False are we live or are we memorex
__label__False o three seven eight
__label__False the reference for for those segment
__label__False it s not within reach and you use the withinreach uh mechanism so i ll d i ll dig you up this reference
__label__False now the the reason for for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back each module will try have to go back to look up which uh you know entity can have which uh you know entity can have which parent and then
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False well that s one way to do it but i ve been saying the other thing is just go through it for the overlap right
__label__False so it s wizard in the sen usual sense that the person who is asking the question doe nt know that it s uh a machi not a machine
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so maybe if we w if we can make one up now that would be c incredibly helpful
__label__False i m rebuilding the net that we re gon na use for the tandem stuff and so what i m doing is um putting in the stream reader into the quicknet library for the sri feature file
__label__False yep
__label__False oh yeah i wa nt necessarily saying it should be better
__label__False what is the first variable in that probability
__label__False no i i think i ll be done everything by this uh by the end of this week
__label__False let s see
__label__False right
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False datdatdah
__label__False the crown
__label__False oh maybe the version i did nt have that i mine the w did the one you sent on the email have the
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False how much how much better wa the best system than ours
__label__False sound like an initialization thing
__label__False so i mean i t t i mean to first order what you d what you re doing
__label__False i mean he s still taking class so uh he may well have conflict
__label__False another wireless setup i mean it s expensive but it doe seem to be better than the wired
__label__False i mean that wa my intention
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False correcting
__label__False um
__label__False ok so here s where we are on the beliefnet stuff a far a i understand it um
__label__False what are the r s
__label__False um the
__label__False bracket digit bracket and do nt bother actually computing the di writing down the digit
__label__False huh
__label__False the layout of the table yeah
__label__False throwing somebody up the stair
__label__False most of them though really were visitor here and lila should have contact with them
__label__False well
__label__False i guess also even for the transcriber it s quicker to load a smaller file into the you know t for the checking problem
__label__False interesting
__label__False aha
__label__False yeah and u i think it would i actually i thi i like that i think it would
__label__False navigational landmark yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yes in a sense that s exactly the the the idea which is never possible in a in a s in a lab situation nuh
__label__False cuz i notice the tidigits number is exactly the same for these last two
__label__False yeah
__label__False that
__label__False we uh i with a i looked with a student i looked at the entire database that we have on heidelberg for case of metonymy
__label__False dave and dave and barry and stephane and u on the uh twentieth
__label__False and i then then i move to the next frame and i
__label__False but i d i m sorry doe it still have the median filter stuff
__label__False uh median
__label__False but
__label__False so that s
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean i guess the prudent thing to do would be for somebody to do the work on on getting our code running on that machine with two processor even though there are nt five or eight
__label__False what movie wa selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representation every di at each dialogue step by the discourse model discourse model yeah that s what it s called and um it doe some help in the anaphora resolution and it also help in coordinating the gesture screen issue so a person pointing to something on the screen you know the discourse model actually store what wa presented at what location on the s on the screen so it s a it s a rather huge huge thing but um um we can sort of it ha a very clear interface we can query it whether admission fee were discussed in the last turn and and the turn before that or you know how deep we want to search um which is a question how deep do we want to sear you know
__label__False the difference between three and four is not particularly great so that mean that whether you have the language in or not is not such a big deal
__label__False that s all i have
__label__False yeah those are e extremely efficient and i and i i agree that s a very good use of it
__label__False cuz well the va if the vad said since the vad is is is right a lot uh
__label__False they re not exclusive group are they
__label__False i put that in just for you
__label__False eight four seven two o seven two three o one seven o
__label__False doe a any you have any thought about what else y you re thinking that you did nt get to that you would like to do if you had more time
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False so
__label__False now the one thing about the s p model is really it only ha a single s emitting state to it
__label__False iram
__label__False yeah
__label__False the crown
__label__False it s one token from the from the corpus
__label__False ok
__label__False and you need a better user interface for displaying the result so
__label__False so the question is what characterization and you re playing around with this another way of looking at it is what characterization of the difference between the raw data and this smooth version is something that you re missing that could help
__label__False well we ve got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case cuz that that s the real goal
__label__False i do nt think we could do it on the mixed signal cuz it
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so he want to know something about it and what it doe
__label__False great well thanks for the filter uh it s really useful tha cuz if you re only at part of a meeting or something
__label__False so you can insert your hand something and there s a correspondence between
__label__False and it make a big difference um on tidigits trained on clean
__label__False transcript l dash one seven four
__label__False yeah i mean i i i we kinda walked through it a little bit on his p on his laptop
__label__False i think transcriber uh output ctm
__label__False oh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and did you handlabel who wa loud and who wa quiet or did you just
__label__False right
__label__False r r right so we have to we
__label__False right so i so my behavior is probably not natural so
__label__False so multifrench multispanish and multienglish
__label__False yeah actually to s eh what i observed in the hm case is that the number of deletion dramatically increase it it double
__label__False oh
__label__False cuz you know i m still sort of itching to to look at what look at the stuff and see what people are saying
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s it s certainly related um might wan na say
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False for
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the thing
__label__False transcript l dash one two seven two eight two two seven six eight six four eight eight three two zero six two six two eight seven five six seven six one seven zero zero seven eight three zero seven five two seven five three eight three five five seven three zero eight five nine five seven one four eight two eight nine six six seven zero two nine three six nine two one five zero five eight zero nine seven six six o three nine seven six
__label__False ldc all the ldc distribution are on cdrom
__label__False synthesis is where you sort of make this uh make these sound and concept to speech is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what need to be said and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce thing better presumably then just with text to speech
__label__False it s just a question of uh of how much uh annoyance i wanted to put uh people going to meeting through
__label__False yeah that s right
__label__False so i tried a hundred to four k yeah
__label__False i i i think eh i saw the nnn the eh but eh i eh i have eh any result
__label__False yeah
__label__False so when that thing when it stutter like that is it because there s a delay getting the data off a disk or is it because there s a delay in the d to a
__label__False um right so the the simple idea behind a support vector machine is um you have you have this feature space right and then it find the optimal separating plane um between these two different um class and um and so um what it i at the end of the day what it actually doe is it pick those example of the feature that are closest to the separating boundary and remembers those and and us them to recreate the boundary for the test set
__label__False right
__label__False yep yep bye
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well eventually you still have to pick out which one you look at so it s pretty much the same problem is nt it
__label__False um
__label__False and then that s a standard
__label__False true
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh well he can do it in something else but i mean you know it s
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False and we are
__label__False and of course you know the the big picture is this bit but you know it would
__label__False projector
__label__False um and so forth and so forth that s sort of motivating it
__label__False make everyone read digit
__label__False eight one nine six nine o three six three six
__label__False actually if you run though on a closetalking mike over the whole meeting during all those silence you get like four hundred percent word error
__label__False um
__label__False phone recognition right right
__label__False but well we are working in this also and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction i do nt
__label__False ok
__label__False i mean the u u
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False that s always warping on something some entity and um
__label__False wow
__label__False huh
__label__False yeah
__label__False eight three one
__label__False yeah good enough for government work a they say
__label__False mmm
__label__False but that s been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized the next step is to work on tightening up the boundary of the time bin
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False what what doe cv do if they if they do overlap
__label__False so d wa that the one that wa the meeting map
__label__False oh uh he he uh he wa here for a couple year and he uh got his phd he
__label__False what if you used a smaller window for the delta
__label__False and then not necessarily have the original data online
__label__False is that is that fifty percent improvement
__label__False no
__label__False yeah
__label__False and so uh
__label__False where where s it gon na be this year
__label__False i mean it s it s it s uh um
__label__False and that we so introduce again some natural behavior in this trajectory
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False right we already know that that we re three short and so if we just did spee uh beep and nonbeep all you would get is that you have three mistake but you would nt tell you which one were wrong
__label__False right
__label__False yeah very low
__label__False uh
__label__False nice wall
__label__False that also appeal to me so that you do nt have to you know
__label__True and uh we ll see which one of those seems closest to right and if they ramped up if towards the end it wa faster you know get some sort of sense from them uh from whoever doe it and um then uh like i say check it out with an external service and see if it s faster cheaper better worse whatever then we ll go from there
__label__False no no but it might not not even be true i mean it s it s it s it s it s a great idea i mean one of the thing that always disturbed me uh in the the resurgence of neural net that happened in the eighty wa that um a lot of people because neural net were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sort of thing without uh looking at all into the linear uh uh version of them and uh people were doing recurrent net but not looking at iir filter and you know i mean uh so i think yeah it s definitely a good idea to try it
__label__False so i wa adding a white noise energy uh that s fifteen db below the maximum energy of the utterance
__label__False in other word it s uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False of course nothing get done even in a meeting of seven people right so um two or three people is the size in which actual work get done
__label__False the i mean
__label__False yeah so now the result are more similar and
__label__False yeah but but we we re swit
__label__False so anyway there s at least probably thirty hour or something of
__label__False the other thing you can do this is on the mixed signal or are these the individual the one with the beep that they re getting that they made mistake on is the mixed one
__label__False i think it s eh i the boot model are recur
__label__False you mean the steak want to pay
__label__False so by uh by by reducing the noise a a decent threshold like minus thirty db it s like
__label__False um
__label__False we have right now like seventyfive or seventysix hour of meeting
__label__False boy they re moving right along
__label__False ok guess we re done
__label__False you could get a lot of lively discussion from those radio one
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s good
__label__False insertion penalty
__label__False ok
__label__False interesting
__label__False and um so this video tape is in front of me i m the origo and i m also the reference object those are twopoint
__label__False we have dropped so silence frame no we have nt dropped silence frame still
__label__False of the straight feature yeah
__label__False i think you were
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so the scoring program with if you give it an stm reference file it will actually compare the word based on their time mark so therefore you can um
__label__False well the idea well we have fixed this equa
__label__False no no no source is just not spelled out here source meaning source will be uh will have a name a type maybe a dimensionality maybe canonical uh orientation
__label__False ok
__label__False speechnonspeech ok
__label__False mmm one day or le
__label__False they have a random number generator right
__label__False i think what i mean by tha that is they re trying to come up with a block diagram that s plausible for the standard
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think i d i m not sure if i understand your question
__label__True and brian
__label__False so it wa really
__label__False you typically train i mean you d have fi you d have fifty hour we d only use one of the pzm channel something like this and so that would you would nt have to use all sixteen channel at once
__label__False well i think you re supposed to ok we can do this everybody s got different digit right
__label__False yeah so that that s actually the definitely the way to do it
__label__False um but i actually got worse result doing that unwrapping using the simple phase unwrapper that s in matlab than i did not unwrapping at all
__label__False i have to go
__label__False mmm
__label__False well you know you sh you you c we re c really concerned about you misleading people into thinking they should be increasing the error rate
__label__False well
__label__False it could be either i mean there are lot of different place it can be delay on the disk or it can be just load get high on the machine
__label__False oh
__label__False oh ok
__label__False so sorry about not not predoing everything the lunch went a little later than i wa expecting
__label__False right
__label__False yeah but that s that s that s risky
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well um the question is that well
__label__False i think javier s might be able to it doe nt have the same gaus uh hm m modeling which is i think a drawback
__label__False uh the the you know what you re doing in feature extraction for speech recognition is you have uh in your head a a a a simplified production model for speech in which you have a periodic or aperiodic source that s driving some filter
__label__False well it s more realistic but it ll it ll be a lot harder
__label__False yeah where doe the lda come from in the
__label__False cuz they have it
__label__False uh
__label__False little bit of noise
__label__False oh that ll be nice
__label__False some constant vector
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False ah
__label__False ok
__label__False you know it s it s probably more fair to rerun the whole th rerun that
__label__False so is this a seven or something or what is it
__label__False i mean dan dan is very interested in doing some other thing and collection at nist so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False ok because then once we have it sort of up and running then we can start you know defining the interface and then feed stuff into it and get stuff out of it and then hook it up to some fake construction parser and
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False i mean it s still not people who are really trying to accomplish something but but uh within the artificial setup it is nt noise artificially added you know simulated uh additive noise
__label__False coup
__label__False one more
__label__False ho how wa your thingy
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s great
__label__False huh
__label__False is that about right
__label__False yeah
__label__False is uhhuh
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah so it d be cool to see if it helped
__label__False kind of a different level of analysis
__label__False certainly for everybody who s been in the meeting so far it would be sufficient i m just wondering about
__label__False yeah i think what is important to see is that there is a big difference between the training mode
__label__False or we could print it up for them i mean we could offer that but but there s uh another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form um my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript and and i ha i do nt know that there s a chance of really skipping that stage
__label__False uh
__label__False i think what morgan s saying is the easier it is the more is gon na be bleeped
__label__False so that s actually interesting the pruning wa the same value that we used for recognition
__label__False nah
__label__False english sentence so uh
__label__True well u uh ibm wa going to um and i imagine they still plan to but but you know i have nt spoken with them about that recently
__label__False hmm
__label__False so hynek will try to push for trying to combine uh different thing or
__label__False so the uh
__label__False hmm
__label__False so i wan na do some test and um actually make some plot of um for a particular amount of data and test what happens if you vary the amount of data in train
__label__False so le let me
__label__False so anyway there s stuff there to sort out
__label__False and and brian actually forwarded me in advance he he wor he very nicely worked out a set of convention which is intermediate between ours and the one that they re used to which is which is really a good a good way to do it
__label__False that s ac actually a little side point is i think that s the first result that we have uh uh uh of any sort on the far field uh on on the far field data uh for recorded in in meeting
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False uh unless there s a person called jackendorf yeah
__label__False is that because the transcript get longer the f transcript file get longer
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False um so it s make fortyfive feature that are used a input to the htk
__label__False i could nt get the word and the waveform at the same time for some reason and there must be some
__label__False s so we ll see and then ami you can decide you know how much time you wan na put into it and uh it it s beginning to take shap shape so uh and i think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the your traditional question in this light uh keith who s buil building construction will be quite happy to uh see what you know you envision a the issue and the problem and um how they might uh get reflected in construction
__label__False absolutely
__label__False and um the reason is why i think it s a little bit more complex or why why we can even think about it a an interesting problem in and of itself is
__label__False yeah
__label__False right um but you know i uh my impression wa that you were actually interested in the farfield microphone uh problem i mean so you want to you want to that s the obvious thing to try right then eh because you you do nt have any that s where the most m acoustic mismatch is between the currently used model and the the r the set up here so
__label__False and uh the third one is how do we how do we merge all the uh information from the individual uh multiband classifier to come up with word word recognition or or phone recognition thing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we ve always viewed it anyway a the major difference between the two is actually in the smoothing that the that the um
__label__False um my counter argument is is an uh uh um a white rat uh which ha th it s two microphone exceedingly close together and it work pretty well
__label__False yeah
__label__False and also the smartkom thing should b
__label__False so right now yeah i th i d say the data is predominantly meeting meeting but there are scattered other meeting in it and that that amount is gon na grow uh so that the meeting meeting will probably ultimately i if we re if we collect fifty or sixty hour the meeting meeting it will probably be you know twenty or thirty percent of it not not not eighty or ninety but
__label__False is that what you re talking about or were there mislabelings a far a like the a adam wa
__label__False but m that may be because with this technique we are using really really clean speech
__label__False oh
__label__False and they re rare event but you can really go through a meeting very quickly you just you just you know yo you s you scroll from screen to screen looking for blip
__label__False so the only task that s similar to this is the training on two language and that
__label__False i i would just like to ask um like if it could happen for next time i mean just beca cuz i m new and i do nt really just i just do nt know what to make of this and what this is for and stuff like that you know so if someone could make an example of what would actually be in it like first of all what module are talking to each other using this right and
__label__False um but uh
__label__False but
__label__False yeah either one will work i think i mean it wa
__label__False and you look you take all o all of the nonspeech component in an utterance so you have a fair amount
__label__False um and in retrospect that s not a surprising a maybe i it should nt have been a surprising a i a a i felt it wa
__label__False but th what they signed in the consent form wa something that said you can use my voice
__label__False yeah
__label__False probably garbage
__label__False ok that s all i have for today
__label__False um
__label__False uh is it about equal between the two
__label__False ok
__label__False which is which is certainly giving a to yeah so it it s an additional discriminating information
__label__False well but i think the main thing maybe is the cleaning of the speech which take forty millisecond or so
__label__False i know it s a disaster
__label__False so there s this assumption that the v the voice activity detector can only use the mfcc
__label__False but it s you ca nt
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean i i i what i thought you were gon na say i but which i wa thinking wa um where did six come from probably came from the same place eighteen came from you know so
__label__False i mean it seems to me that you can get both in in english depending o you know like in front of the car could you know like here s the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something s in front of the car or whatever i could see that but
__label__False yep pretty much
__label__False so are we gon na do digit simultaneously or what
__label__False well it s it s it s an interesting thought i mean we we could disagree about it at length but the the real thing is if you re interested in it you ll probably try it and and we ll see
__label__False the the p the point here is that it would be nice t for there to be one repository
__label__True and uh i guess the main topic will be uh you telling u what happened
__label__False and i wa asking if you were going to do redo it uh for plp with the normalization done a it had been done for the mel cepstrum
__label__True great uh could you give adam a call tell him to
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False right
__label__False i mean this is how i wa imagining it anyway and then i figured that out of that group there would be a subset who would go hmm you know i m really not sure about this section here and then that group would need it
__label__False yeah i mean uh what i m arguing is that that that s givi you give you your intuition
__label__False right right i i see i wa i wa about to say so if if you ask it what what movie are on tv tonight if i look at my wristwatch when i say that it s about two second the way i currently have the mean subtraction um set up the the analysis window is two second so what you just said about what do you start with raise a question of what do i start with then i guess it because
__label__False are we going
__label__False well for example if we include that yeah um accessibility or something yeah
__label__False yeah so i think you re thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and i just do nt think that s gon na happen
__label__False but
__label__False yeah that s basically what i wa gon na say is that a disk is is so cheap it s e essentially you know close to free
__label__False yeah
__label__False on the far field also he did one pzm channel and one pda channel
__label__False temporal and spectral
__label__False uhoh
__label__False i thi
__label__False we just want to know how we should answer where is x
__label__False if we do it any other way that mean that we need a separate procedure and someone ha to do that
__label__False and we actually did not want to constrain it too much you know just see what people say
__label__False ok ok
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False the trouble is that you know i understand it in that context but it but it is almost resentful it s almost like you know resentful of the data resentful of the um the hard work that s going into preparing the data is
__label__False right but i missed it but it wa uh
__label__False yeah it s the power spectrum
__label__False right
__label__False well that s sort of what msg doe
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i could ask something like where can i find out about blahblahblah in a sort of doe nt nece i do nt necessarily have to care about the spatial location just give me a phone number and i ll call them or something like that
__label__False um
__label__False and it just it wa just terribly frustrating for him and he seemed fully committed to both side of this i i irreconcilable thing
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False there s a bunch of data that l around that people have done study like that w way way back right i mean
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False uh how are you how are you coming up with
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so i mean that s easy to do um it it move u away from this uniform all the mike are the same which some people had said wa a benefit
__label__False and if it if you do it
__label__False i checked it a little bit but there might be alignment error
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s really the backup issue rather than the file server issue
__label__False five with wireless so we could have eight
__label__False so um
__label__False and then she said and then he said
__label__False so that s where the biggest improvement came up not much in the well match and the medium match and tidigits also right now
__label__False yeah they have a x xray
__label__False right
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False um but the software seemed to compile fine and everything so
__label__False right it s
__label__False but after cleaning up you have now a different set of snrs right
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah that could be sizeable right there
__label__False four four six nine
__label__False mmm
__label__False oh so it is a sigmoidal
__label__False alright
__label__False no no
__label__False yeah although it it it it may be separating out these number from the rest yeah
__label__False but
__label__False well actually we we just basically do a s a fixed number of iteration
__label__False yeah
__label__False um after that um you have the um filtering of the silence probability
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__False um and i think the heuristic of exactly how people handle that and how they handle their training
__label__False i mean it s not like it s one or the other we can do both
__label__False yeah well when l when liz uh shriberg start coming then there s another woman although she
__label__False you might just wan na like tack that on a a comment to something
__label__True uh sunday
__label__False what what we need is a just a mechanism that say
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and run it on several machine and it just basically keep count
__label__True let s see maybe we should just get a list of item thing that we should talk about
__label__False hmm
__label__False well maybe
__label__False so
__label__False well i do nt see any way of avoiding that i mean we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove part that they do nt like
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so um i ve forgotten now what the name of that machine is but i can
__label__False hmm
__label__False so um i wan wan na wan na see what that is
__label__False do they have to be mutual
__label__False right
__label__False and then we ve got the uh
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False well maybe
__label__False is that a good characterization i do nt know
__label__False and then it wa uh and then it would come on and it wa very clear you know
__label__False ok
__label__False maybe i mean i i think you could make the same argument it d be just a legitimate for hybrid system a well
__label__False do we have anything else to say about transcription
__label__False boy the guy i knew who built them built them like twenty twenty year ago so they re it s the the technique work pretty well
__label__False so um y you ll have those say somewhere what their intention wa so you still have the the nice thing about having data where you know what the actual intention wa
__label__True wha what did i have on the agenda i mailed out
__label__False i asked uh hynek whether
__label__False well i mean i i think one thing to do is to just not rely on a single number to maybe have two or three number you know and and and say here s how much you uh you improve the uh the the relatively clean case and here s or or wellmatched case and here s how here s how much you uh
__label__False is my last my last day my my last meeting about meeting
__label__False wizardette
__label__True so he s he s going to icassp which is good i i do nt know if there are many people who are going to icassp so so i thought make sure somebody go
__label__False yeah
__label__False i had another thought
__label__False that s good
__label__False do you have the mean do you have the mean for the autocorrelation
__label__False yeah be uh actu actually
__label__False you know
__label__False no i i d
__label__False yeah
__label__False w w
__label__False yeah i i it even though the generator is a little bit more complex and it would have been not changing one hundred word but maybe four hundred word but it would have been
__label__False eight four two six one four six two seven
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah the only difference it s is that it s multilingual
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well in the proposal um the input of the vad network were just three frame i think
__label__False but you know they they re they re gon na macro for inserting the beep mark
__label__False let s see come on
__label__False he want to go there and know something about it
__label__False and
__label__False i d probably still respond to it
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh i would nt be
__label__False uh did you wan na go next stephane
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False cool
__label__False yeah not only cogsci also we will talk about linguistics and of course computer science
__label__False so
__label__False mmm how doe clean training do for the uh car stuff
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False all no because it doe nt automatically bleep it at the time it just sends me
__label__False and uh and uh a nice amount of memory uh so it ll be a pr pretty fast linux machine
__label__False the training and testing
__label__False so maybe this is a s a way out of it
__label__False well
__label__False yeah
__label__False i guess the fiftysix percent improvement in the speechdatcar becomes like sixtyseven percent
__label__False huh
__label__False so king and and taylor um did this with uh recurrent neural net and this i their their idea wa to first find a mapping from mfcc s to uh phonological feature and then later on once you have these phonological feature then uh map that to phone so i m i m sort of reproducing phase one of their stuff
__label__False yeah but but that it s
__label__False uh i mean calendar year two thousand one
__label__False and the reason wa because i transcribed that at a point before uh before we had the multiple audio available f so i could nt switch between the audio i i transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely which meant in overlap i wa at a at a terrific disadvantage
__label__False ok
__label__False you know liz all we would re
__label__False yeah
__label__False yes
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False you c you clip that part over your ear
__label__False so we were ah
__label__False street or airport or something
__label__False so you just archive it on the tape and then put it on cd a well
__label__False send email to jane that someone ha done a revision
__label__False but i think that you could certainly do d um distributed sort of ah no it s the each individual sentence is pretty tricky to parallelize
__label__False ok
__label__False well that s good
__label__False ok
__label__False so you see like the fzero contour
__label__False and then you hear the beep again and then you say well is that that beep or is that a new beep i do nt remember and so you know a couple time they got it wrong
__label__False well i it ha
__label__False nah
__label__False if you are using t if you are using three frame if you are phrasing f using three frame it is thirty here for delta
__label__False n
__label__False yeah
__label__False r right but in term of for norm for adaptation right
__label__False oh sorry go ahead
__label__False could you go ahead and turn on uh stephane s
__label__False ok
__label__False so once everything get converted over to the disk we re supposed to be using we ll be probably uh seventyfive percent
__label__False so only enter will be if we if our if our module decided that enter is the case
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well you re doing that anyway
__label__False no no i m sorry in in the one you pointed at what s that variable
__label__False t t um
__label__False yeah
__label__False this wa um kemal sonmez at sri who s a coworker with uh liz
__label__False i would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we we all uh agree on what what the meaning of these thing is at the moment and maybe what change we
__label__False yeah th
__label__False we could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it
__label__False yea are you talking are you talking about the the structure
__label__False see i thought you showed me something like that last week
__label__False well i in fact uh m in those experiment it wa nt so much combining multiple net it wa a single net that had different
__label__False the c
__label__False i mean it s consistent in the speechdatcar and in the clean training also it give it but this fifty percent is is that the the high mismatch performance equivalent to the high mismatch performance in the speech
__label__False what wa the w what wa the downsampling problem again i forget
__label__False it generates byte code
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False he used the identical pruning threshold even though the s the range of p of the likeli
__label__False no
__label__False well if yo if you re interested in that so how how i mean it doe sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent so
__label__False so we have to equip him with a with a with a headmounted uh cell phone and
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean can we keep the microphone and just somehow attach a more comfortable thing over your head
__label__False i
__label__False sorry
__label__False alright let s stop talking about this
__label__False yeah a commercial event or something yeah so uh so we would we would instantiate the spg schema with a sourcepathgoal blahblahblah and the buying event you know at which however that look like the place f thing to buy
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False uh i mean the vad stuff they both had right
__label__False the beep file
__label__False we ve never just trained on one lang
__label__False hmm j i do nt know
__label__False transcript two eight seven one dash two eight nine zero three three eight four four six five two five eight zero six seven eight zero
__label__False are you oh they re clean
__label__False so the v
__label__False and um they were they were perturbed with me because i wa breathing in instead of breathing out and they had model for they they had markov model for br breathing out but they did nt have them for breathing in
__label__False uh let s see it start with one here and then go around and end with nine here
__label__False a st uh well you can certainly say um you know i m in overload
__label__False yeah exactly so it s not i do nt think the filter shape by itself will make a huge difference
__label__False yeah
__label__False and they re certainly gon na wan na change tool
__label__False uh right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False fifty millis yeah
__label__False yeah if there are any problem
__label__False right
__label__True i guess morgan s leaving on saturday
__label__False so maybe just looking at this frequency range for from five hundred to two thousand would improve somewhat the vad and
__label__False i listened to probably uh five or ten minute of it from the beginning
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False eight three nine five six zero four nine one one
__label__False you w
__label__False yeah
__label__False well let s say for in see mfcc for instance doe nt have anything in it uh related to the pitch
__label__False ok then uh on to the modeling
__label__False right
__label__True so maybe if you tested it using that you d have more reliable stretch of nonspeech to do the estimation from and see if that help
__label__False that s brilliant
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False um well we w we do nt have it actually because it s it ha a high rate energy the vad ha a
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False that s why i wanted to avoid having to do that if we could but
__label__False indeed
__label__False i just wa nt saying it very well i guess
__label__False hmm yeah
__label__False and we also
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah i mean we could certainly break the meeting
__label__False um
__label__False well w would nt we just take the structure that s outputted and then run another transformation on it that would just dump the one that we wanted out
__label__False not exactly
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah we have the um the one we ve been using the one we got for the pc
__label__False oh yes well you see that s part of the cleaning process i spent um actually um i have a segment of ten minute that wa transcribed by two of our transcriber and i went through it last night it s it s almost spooky how similar these are word for word and there are some difference in comma cuz comma i i left them discretion at comma
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False basically we have three type of broad phonetic class
__label__False right
__label__False he s he s very interested in that
__label__False yeah it s very short interval
__label__False i i m sorry i do nt understand your question
__label__False and
__label__False oh that s right i i did look that up i could nt remember whether that wa tidigits or one of the other digit task
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh uh but
__label__False aurora s very specific
__label__False yeah
__label__False he said it s hard to find thing you say wrong
__label__False so going from channel zero to channel one uh almost double the error rate
__label__False do i have more slide
__label__False oops
__label__False like bus dog fried egg i mean
__label__False yeah
__label__False this is you
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False and we discussed on some method to do it my approach originally and i ve already hacked on it a little bit it wa too slow because i wa trying to display all the waveform but he pointed out that you do nt really have to i think that s a good point
__label__False alright so
__label__False yeah so that s maybe a problem with what i wa just saying but but i i guess
__label__False whereas what we were doing is is uh taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that which mean that it s it s uh i it could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you do nt want to um uh train a particular band train the detector for a particular band you you wan na ignore that band cuz that s a ban band is a noisy noisy measure
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well cuz they re s distinguishing between twentythree that s your indicator there and twentythree that somebody happens to say in a meeting
__label__False no i mean this it it s the htk that is trained on a very limited amount of data yeah
__label__False uh huh
__label__False o eight six three zero nine four nine seven four four one two zero eight four w one five four eight four zero six eight three o three eight seven seven eight
__label__False ok
__label__False and there s no adaptor for it
__label__False and uh i i found the same problem just taking um what we were used to u use
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False um
__label__False ah
__label__False there must be because otherwise you re going a whole
__label__False oh yeah yeah
__label__False well they are trained on the same data a the final hmm are
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok and uh e i do nt know when chuck will be back but that s exactly what he he s gon na
__label__False and then then even if you know that can that help you i mean what can what strategy can you do to do well without that particular band in the spectrum
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yeah it s it s nice to know and also i think a a human like i do nt always hear these in the actual order that they occur so i can have two foreground speaker you know morgan an and um adam and jane could all be talking and i could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time and then look where they are relative to each other and that s not really what i heard
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok so we do nt have to worry about transcribing it
__label__False uh and
__label__False you wan na
__label__False ok so while we re still at this sort of top level anything else that we oughta talk about today
__label__False well the time to mention it if you mention it is when you talk about mirror neuron then you should talk about the more recent stuff about the kicking and you know the yeah yeah and that the plan is to see to what extent the you ll get the same phenomenon with story about this so that and that we re planning to do this um which we are
__label__False well i mean you yeah of course you re you re also uh your volume is is greater but but still i mean they they say
__label__False no they re using a ninepoint window which is like a four on either side which is like f so they did nt include that
__label__False i think you ve got one on hand huh
__label__False i think it would also be interesting to have uh a couple of the meeting have more than one transcriber do cuz i m curious about interannotator agreement
__label__False but the point is that that kind of construction is also used in english you know like right where you start to go up the hill or just when you get off the train or something like that to uh to indicate where something is so we ll have to think about
__label__False than
__label__False right
__label__False so this is word word error rate so a high number is bad
__label__False uh and for that mmm uh that purpose uh they d like to pull it out
__label__False have them
__label__False it is wideband ok
__label__False i ll say it wrong but anyway some some potential collaboration there about about the about the working with these data
__label__False six five one seven three six two six zero
__label__False and if so like can are you able to enforce that you know if if it s if it s spg action then you have that schema if it s a forced motion then you have the other schema present in the
__label__False yeah
__label__False oops
__label__False my my feedback from the transcriber is he is always close to crystal clear and and just fan fantastic to
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False right
__label__False well even i mean coming down from campus is sort of a big thing but what about or what about people in the in the building
__label__False three eight four six five five two zero two five
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so i i do nt know if it s a noticeable difference but it is
__label__False tell me the location of x
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False so ok let s go back to what you thought i wa asking you
__label__False um but um it uh i guess i maybe i said this last week too but it it it really became apparent to u that we need to to take account of noise
__label__False nuh
__label__False more than three of u
__label__False i think that wa chuck
__label__False yeah
__label__False so um in particular i wa thinking um in in the hybrid framework just taking those lna file and um setting to zero those probability that um that these phone are not voicing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i bet the pruning
__label__False cu cube root
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean we could try it
__label__False yeah i mean right yeah i mean it wa
__label__False is that nine frame u s uh centered around the current frame or
__label__False well
__label__False and really the reason we ca nt do it is just that we do nt have a we do nt have ground truth for these so we would need a handmarked um wordlevel alignment or at least sort of the boundary of the speech betw you know between the speaker
__label__False and the audio file it s not worth doing cuz they re too big you re never gon na be copying them around and making working copy of them
__label__False well to some extent i have to do that anyway because a i said we have to distribute password
__label__False yeah
__label__False not directly i m trying to think if if i could have gotten it over a list i do nt i do nt think so
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh
__label__False yep
__label__False so that when you re developing it and it s really rough you do nt put it in the repository
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah so
__label__False oh
__label__False ok
__label__False not not rehearse i mean i have just not spent any time on it so i can show you what i ve got get your input on it and maybe some suggestion that would be great
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False yep
__label__False and so the
__label__False right
__label__False two two four one nine three six eight four one nine five five nine five seven seven six two three four six four five three two three one five six four six nine o two o one eight nine six six five nine seven four o two six eight five eight three two six seven five two seven five nine eight two six nine five one six six o six six nine one seven four six nine
__label__False is that possible
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh ok
__label__False be i mean because the there are more uh mismatched condition than the matching condition for testing
__label__False so i ve been trying to find where the problem came from and then it look like i have some problem in the way there is some some very silly bug somewhere and ugh
__label__False right
__label__False one suggestion i have is that um
__label__False um so there is u normally a figure for the finnish and one for italian
__label__False a fixed expression yeah
__label__False this is a cate this a category structure here right action schema
__label__False let s l let s see um
__label__False yeah yeah yeah yeah
__label__False yeah right
__label__False six two six five five two five two eight
__label__False because um i think that ll be running linux and sw swede and fudge are already running linux so um i could try to get um the train the neural network training or the htk stuff running under linux and to start with i m wondering which one i should pick first
__label__False like it doe nt refer to thing it refers to acti you know j thing standing for activ most relevant activity for a tourist you could think of it that way but
__label__False but tcl is wonderful
__label__False an an and and our and our
__label__False ok so i guess about eleven thousand parameter which actually should nt be a problem even in in small phone yeah
__label__False yep i we know about it
__label__False so like it s not really doing any distinction between speech and nonspeech or i mean different among class
__label__False porzel and the uh
__label__False right and that i mean at the moment that s not the limitation so
__label__False so it s just based on like the material you had about heidelberg
__label__False mmm
__label__False i mean
__label__False yes i know myself it s ok it s a
__label__False well i ll talk about it when i get the picture up
__label__False yeah
__label__False and um we have a little description of asking peop subject to contact fey for you know recruiting them for our thing and um there wa some confusion a to the consent form which is basically that that what what you just signed and since we have one already um
__label__True and uh somebody eh e and uh i guess chuck you were nt there either so the uh
__label__False that is so he d put all th all the dot down and we went through this and i think more or le convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the node that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of were in there
__label__False ok
__label__False training condition
__label__False are you gon na do any dry run for your thing or are you just gon na
__label__False yeah it s it s it s apple and orange nuh
__label__False so what about
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and the the other thing wa about the subspace approach
__label__False and and s several of them are trained in ipa c they really could do phonetic transcription if if we wanted them to
__label__False oh oh boy
__label__False hi
__label__False ok i can give you a more recent if you want well that might have enough
__label__False right
__label__False i built this thing it s that s it s very noisy we re actually recording i m i m going through it at the moment but it s so noisy that i am not using for this it s it s designed to be used for the for the desktop meeting a well
__label__False this is another voiced example yeah
__label__False look like uh you t you explaining in the blackboard the yeah yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False basically reference from the role in the schema the bottom schema to the action schema is wha uh i m assuming
__label__False oh you have nt oh ok
__label__False and again i do nt think we ll be able to do with that alone because um sometimes people correct themselves and thing like that
__label__False um one suggestion and you may already be doing this but
__label__False yeah yeah no no there s no no it is nt sensitive at all i wa just
__label__False is x
__label__False it it like this
__label__False ok
__label__False i mean it uh like i i i it is well known this this medium match condition of the finnish data ha some strange effect i mean that is
__label__False so you ve got two week huh
__label__False six five six nine eight two eight four nine four four six
__label__False you have a specific intention to cross the traffic light to get there you have a further specific intention to left to lift your right foot and so uh uh i mean y you really have to focus on on on and decide the level of of abstraction that that you aim at it kind of zero in on that and more or le ignore the rest unless there is some implication that that you want to constant draw from from subtasks um that are relevant uh i mean but very difficult
__label__False wa there any conclusion about that
__label__False five three seven three six seven seven five zero seven
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah but
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False it just basically look like it just specifies a bunch of structs
__label__True ok so friday whoever want and come and can
__label__False but and when we use the filter that s derived from clean speech we jumped so from eightytwo point seven to eightyfive point one which is a huge leap
__label__True smartkom
__label__False th this yeah ok
__label__False yeah that s funny
__label__False especially if we get a few more processor and upgrade the processor
__label__False oh right i see what you mean
__label__False oh do i not
__label__False they were doing similar enough thing
__label__False mmm i wa just thinking maybe about like generalized diphones and come up with a a reasonable not too large set of context dependent unit and
__label__False yeah if we re very
__label__False yeah that s doe nt make it a great term it s just like those joke where you have to work on both level do you see what i mean like
__label__False othe other than lengthening the transcript
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah y
__label__False so is
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh that s right tomorrow
__label__False so so in reality if you put this this system in into uh the field it would be twentyfour hundred bit per second not fortyeight hundred
__label__False uh do we know about disk
__label__False all al
__label__False so that look good
__label__False eight five eight zero three four seven one four
__label__False yeah and there is the delta at the input which is um
__label__False no we have to r
__label__False so mark them
__label__False and then i wanted to talk about but a i said i we may not have time what we should do about digit we have a whole pile of digit that have nt been transcribed
__label__False any any form meaning pair to my understanding is a construction
__label__False hmm
__label__False just make shorter file
__label__False ok could it it could also be blocked out then a ok
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False and that s always worse than using sixtyfour hertz
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False transcript l dash four nine
__label__False oh so this upper third
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False easy enough to figure out we have all that data
__label__False i wa these meeting i m sure someone thought of this but these this uh reading of the number would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation um
__label__False wiener filter for example i do nt know maybe it s it s possible to to have the same result i do nt know exactly
__label__False great
__label__False th th the boot model are trained from scratch so we compute um
__label__False i do nt know wha whatever you generate yeah the last one you did were compressed
__label__False i just thought if it wa tried and true then and he s gone through additional level of of development
__label__False i think we were recognition
__label__False maybe it wa just
__label__False uh yeah the next thing is i started to play
__label__False before it wa just
__label__False it s not a meeting
__label__False um i m
__label__False mmhmm hmm
__label__False i mean it seems to me if you have exactly the right thing then it s better to do it without the net because otherwise you re asking the net to learn this you know say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication
__label__False yeah i d
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False like if you re asked a whereis question you may not even look like ask for the posterior probability of the uh eva node right
__label__False one thing that bug me about javabayes is you have to click that and do this
__label__False yeah this is not an xml this is sort of towards an a schema nuh definition
__label__False y you know basically three three microphone bak basically flaked which make it hard for the data to be used for all possible purpose
__label__False so
__label__False but a thousand event in twelve minute that s
__label__False plus there is a delta at the input
__label__False yeah
__label__False is that t san francisco chicago
__label__False it s just our our old munich uh loudnessbased spectrum on mel scale twenty twenty critical band and then loudness
__label__False but if that then you would think you d hear much more clamoring about data loss and
__label__False no or if you did i did nt include them cuz it wa
__label__False i m sorry
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False bec because the result are a little bit better but we have in a point that everything is more or le the similar more or le similar
__label__False i think we ve we ve covered that one up extremely well
__label__False but what he is doing language dependent is measuring what that number i reference is that he come down twenty five down from
__label__False yeah i want to get to the church quickly and uh
__label__False i assume that you can send them anything that they can access with http
__label__False you mean there re more than ten
__label__False for for aurora
__label__False so there are number then there are acronym and then um there s a he she want the uh actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is so i curly b inside the curly bracket i m gon na put either
__label__False are how big are these file that we send to brian
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i think it s i
__label__False well i think it s important both for the notation and the machine representation to be the same
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False but the the problem with what you re suggesting is it s not just inconvenient for them it s inconvenient for me
__label__False that s the not the construction parser that s the uh tabletbased parser and the generation outputter
__label__False so um in term of password distribution i think phone is really the only way to do it phone and in person or mail physical mail
__label__False i i had nt thought about this but i thou i wanted to raise this when you were uh with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignment potentially but that s
__label__True the smartkom data
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s real noise condition
__label__False yeah
__label__False speech research
__label__False not at all that s that that need a lot of work but uh that would ve made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter so we decided that for the purpose of this it d be simpler to just have three verb
__label__False i m not sure i totally understand this but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and similarly we re not gon na tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meeting
__label__False yeah mmm
__label__False i m sorry it wa two three week for training up for the large broadcast news test set training set
__label__False yeah
__label__False huh
__label__True i do nt know beliefnets very well
__label__False if it s night time they have not discussed admission fee and the n wall are nice so yeah
__label__False s ok so d the detection threshold is very
__label__False well tilman s
__label__False but but but um
__label__False you know cuz we re gon na wan na be playing with the uh help my brain with the uh prosody stuff anyway
__label__False oh oh so this i is this the difference here for that
__label__False and polysemy and stuff like that
__label__False yeah
__label__False there s also um oh yeah noise so the echo cancellation doe not really allow for noise
__label__False no
__label__False and good submission right well
__label__False well it s not it s not actually a very actually it doe nt actually
__label__False so train a phone in the neural net
__label__False what
__label__False uh but ok
__label__False uhhuh yeah exactly yeah yeah
__label__False transcript l dash threeonetwo
__label__False so hang on so that would ok
__label__False can he send them i guess he could send them multiple tape
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so it s in the uh
__label__False ok i understand now alright thanks
__label__False you can use time where that person is talking only from the transcript but the segmentation were were synchronized or you can do a forced alignment on the closetalking to determine that the you know within this segment these really were the time that this person wa talking and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping and just frontend those piece
__label__False oh you mean you would need to rerun the recognition
__label__False you said that there were some place where it wa nt what y wa written already but you could see how they might have thought that s what it said
__label__False uh true false that s acceptable
__label__False people reach their level of uh max their level of at which they re incompetent or whatever
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and so it s just a way of putting it all out on the table uh a opposed to
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False o o nine o one one nine four two five four three four six eight nine two seven four nine o one uh correction four nine one o five seven zero eight four six seven o seven five seven nine three
__label__False ok our our uh
__label__False uh i mean we re in conjunction with uh sri washington and um columbia
__label__False ok f let s let s suppose you use in and on
__label__False right
__label__False i do nt know about that
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah because they re two different thing one of which is l you could think of one a sub you know pru whatever precondition for the second
__label__False um do you know the signaltonoise like that s another one i see all the time where you assume it s known
__label__False but there s the idea is that there are these microphone on the table there are some cable coming down sort of under a nice mat and then that s they a bunch of them get sort of converged with digital there
__label__False give px and uh p the noise
__label__False right right i m expect i m not expecting
__label__False oh at the front it say uh log energy is equal to the rounded version of sixteen over the log of two
__label__False yeah is film the trajector
__label__False yeah
__label__False i might not realize that he wa talking about disk space a opposed to anything else
__label__False and he s saying you you know i always thought chuck spoke really well
__label__False so you would keep it in a separate file structure until you were ready to put it in the repository
__label__False i have had an experience not often but a certain number of time when for example i m working with a tool a screwdriver or something for a long time
__label__False yeah
__label__False but if on the ha other hand uh it s say somewhere in between what you re seeing now and and and uh what you d have with just the pure feature then maybe there is some problem of a of a uh combination of these thing or correlation between them somehow
__label__False twelve minute
__label__False yeah
__label__False right by hand yeah
__label__False fifty percent looking in the lower righthand corner fifty percent relative performance
__label__False mmm
__label__False no actually i i have to i have to shuttle kid from various place to various other place
__label__False did it get rid of other stuff besides the speech ok wow interesting
__label__False hmm
__label__False no
__label__False yeah
__label__False and you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work and so it s
__label__False yeah
__label__False i have nt looked at it yet but i will
__label__False is that anywhere near the castle
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean we ve got a lot more data than we have transcription for we have the audio data we have the closetalking mike so i mean it seems like one kind of project that s not perfect but um that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is you know if you infer form the closetalking mike where the onoff point are of speech you know how can we detect that from a farfield
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False but you re saying for this for the adaptation you mean
__label__False they re doing some noise removal thing right
__label__False and those those system work very well by the way i mean so people use them in panel discussion and so forth with sound reinforcement differing in in sort of uh and uh those if
__label__False it doe all the work for you
__label__False they re going to have to make speaker assignment and wh and which recording are they gon na listen to
__label__False th well this is
__label__False but we will use the the lda filter f derived from clean speech
__label__False input reader and an output stream yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep
__label__False uh no it doe nt have to but that that s i find that s the only way to wear it
__label__False and my attitude wa yes because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustic a opposed to just for language
__label__False yeah yeah he you talked about it oh ok so you know what he s doing alright
__label__False it s interesting uh
__label__False i think it would be
__label__False um
__label__False um right uh
__label__False are they is it using the database the german tv movie ok so all the actual data might be german name
__label__False ok what all you know what are the consideration and how and what are the way in which they relate
__label__False then you can go up to sixtytwo percent error rate reduction globally
__label__False right
__label__False yeah that wa gon na be my question
__label__False and it
__label__False i i
__label__False so usually you have maybe in clean condition you have something which look like this and if it is noisy it is somewhere here
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False we should have a look first at perhaps the modulation spectrum
__label__False yeah one of the thing i wa thinking with transcript is that if we take the near field and we do an initial recognition pas is it easier for a transcriber to correct a transcript if the near field mike doe a reasonably good job
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok so there s you know sort of yeah deep really deep emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh complete
__label__False ok
__label__False nine eight two four eight eight eight one two
__label__False for some reason when you said feedback electronically i thought of that you ever see the simpson where they re like the family s got the buzzer and they buzz each other when they do nt like what the other one is saying
__label__False so which which meeting what meeting do we have
__label__False ok the landmark is facing to the tourist
__label__False one more
__label__False yeah
__label__False w ok
__label__False yeah people have the same problem with my name
__label__False um and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than lda
__label__False and then you try to subtract it or wiener filter or whatever and what you get is you have always these problem that you have this these these these zero in there
__label__False i mean i like that idea because even a casual user can always send email to whoever s in charge and say you know we d like these change and you know hopefully we ll give them a response and if they really do it a lot and they say
__label__False um
__label__False ok
__label__False transcriber will export stm
__label__False um so what i wa started playing with wa the th again this is the htk backend and um
__label__False ok
__label__False you could affect
__label__False right
__label__False it s a smoothing over the the gain of the subtraction algorithm
__label__False ok
__label__False well it improves on the wellmatched and the mismatched condition but it get worse on the highly mismatched
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False well it s i think it s better than anything uh anybody got
__label__False yeah so i think yeah we just wanted to understand how you re defining it so then in the region between since there there is some continuous region in between region where there is only one person speaking and one contiguous region like that you re calling an event
__label__False and this is the mixed signal
__label__False sorry to interrupt
__label__False they they clearly did actually remove silent section in order because they got these word error rate result
__label__False good
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s what i
__label__False but not at the same time
__label__False oh to get r to get rid of the wired thing yes absolutely
__label__False smartkom group are collecting some dialogue basically they have one person sitting in here looking at a picture and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere
__label__False five
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh ok sorry go on
__label__False well
__label__False so
__label__False though maybe not
__label__False i thi it s just an issue we have nt dealt with before how you timealign thing that are overlapping anyway
__label__False i talk eh about eh acoustic event in general but eh my my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone
__label__False ok that much from the parser and generator side unless there are more question on that
__label__False alright
__label__False wh
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s like a disclaimer
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False e o do y well we we re connected to uh there s a there s a a very significant connection between we ll we ll go through this
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so
__label__False mmm
__label__False it is different
__label__False so that so that otherwise you do nt you
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False uh yeah that s all
__label__False i m i m hiring people who uh really are
__label__False ok
__label__False i guess yeah i guess if we segmented it we could get one percent on digit
__label__False what else
__label__False yeah so the w
__label__False ok
__label__False and all the name could should be taken cum grano salis so this is a the fact that we re calling this action schema right now should not entail that we are going to continue calling this action schema but what that mean is we have here first of all on the in the in the first iteration a stupid list of sourcepathgoal action
__label__False yeah i think this context node is a bit of a
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False which make sense
__label__False transcript l dash three zero four
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh ok
__label__False and four additional feature which is energy loudness modified loudness and zero crossing rate
__label__False so if it s not optional you know it s it s not gon na hurt a whole lot and it s tied to the center state of the silence model so it s not it own um
__label__False and we think that with this approach perhaps we could reduce the number of output of the neural network
__label__False hmm
__label__False i guess just
__label__False yeah
__label__False also it would be nice to get ultimately to get a nice mental space example so even temporal reference are
__label__False there s a spectral subtraction style piece it wa basically you know wiener filtering
__label__False it basically say well
__label__False oh yeah the f
__label__False well i have nt sent them yet because i wa having this problem with the missing file
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah and then this time constant increase and i have a threshold that well if it s higher than a certain threshold i keep it to this threshold to still uh adapt um the mean when if the utterance is uh long enough to to continue to adapt after like one second or
__label__False every construction
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so we have to jiggle it somehow
__label__False yeah
__label__True and then we re going to have another we re gon na have w another trial run ie the first with that new setup tomorrow at two and we have a real interesting subject which is ron kay for who those who know him he s the founder of ici so he ll he s around seven seventy year old or something
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i you know i i had several that had to do with backchannels and this wa nt one of them this this one really doe um m make you leap from so he said you know we re ahead of the game w we have builtin downsampling
__label__False two three seven four zero four two two six five seven one
__label__False i i actually thought it wa it wa doing fine when i tested it once i it s like using a small section of the code and then i ran the whole recognition experiment with italian and i got like worse result than not using it
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False if you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the the warping uh factor so um
__label__False right
__label__False in in what
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah that s what he wa talking about
__label__False oh the remote will do it ok cuz i m already up there
__label__False yeah
__label__False how many eh not i
__label__False you have to may add some jitter to it
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s on the filter bank so so yeah probably
__label__False and then there ll be a subset of people right ok there s i mean think of who it is we ve been recording mostly ok there ll be a subset of people who um will say uh well yeah i really would like to see that and for them the easiest way to flip through if it s a really large document
__label__False ok well maybe it s not a big deal
__label__False really
__label__False um
__label__False well i think it s
__label__False that
__label__False mmm
__label__False so
__label__False ok
__label__False building
__label__False well
__label__False well i guess
__label__False but i ca nt
__label__False because they ch i know they changed it their compression they have their own crc their their own error correction mechanism so they do nt have to wait more than one more frame to know whether the current frame is in error
__label__False no i wo nt ask the next question then
__label__False yeah otherwise it d be a good idea
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh o oh ok so that s that s that s standard um
__label__False having it well the in the consent form is right in there if anyone want to look at it so
__label__False ninepoint
__label__False couple tenth of a percent or something right
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False ok
__label__False eight five six three one nine eight eight seven
__label__False yeah
__label__False and if we can actually get it get it going that would be neat
__label__False it s overlapping
__label__False yeah
__label__False r right so so i guess this sri system is trained on a lot of s broadcast news or switchboard data
__label__False mmm
__label__False i dunno if you want that
__label__False and we should be there pretty soon with at least like at least with you know being able to search over c certain amount of meeting just like really basic stuff just asking fo looking for a word and looking through a bunch of different meeting
__label__False right
__label__False i consider the the nnn the nnn nnn eh the entirety eh eh all all the time there were the voice ha overlapped
__label__False that s wonderful
__label__False so we ll do that t maybe uh
__label__False yeah just give a dedi
__label__False so no sample generator output yet
__label__False so i i i is german uh closer to to e uh uh uh uh to e i mean uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False right
__label__False mmm because i have mmm worse result in medium mismatch and high mismatch
__label__False ok doe nt look like it crashed that s great
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False italy huh
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh well
__label__False yeah
__label__False right in that case you would nt necessarily expect it to be better at all
__label__False hmm
__label__False no but those are all different people with different i mean i in y
__label__False ok
__label__False i mean that are le well i do nt uh that have some more emotional aspect to them or strong
__label__False but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that s the weird one
__label__False face yourself with this pr question you get this
__label__False you want me to wait what do you want me to do
__label__False oh
__label__False what
__label__False yeah did you break the microphone
__label__False o o eight one two two eight six eight three five three seven one zero nine four five
__label__False but i think that fiftyfive wa for the when the output are the fiftysix phone
__label__False you do ok
__label__False i wa just i wa overreacting just because we ve been talking about it it s ok to
__label__False i do nt know w
__label__False so it s it s not bad but the problem is still that the latency is too large
__label__False yeah yeah well
__label__False hmm
__label__False this is a simple way to basically link uh role to action
__label__False twenty four
__label__False you should get a tshirt that say that
__label__False ok i ll do that
__label__False um
__label__False mmm
__label__False right so the decision wa that jane did not want the transcriber to be doing any of the paperwork so i did the all that last week
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well uh maybe
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so
__label__False mike five
__label__False right but the speechdatcar data that you re seeing is also reduced in noise by the noise compensation
__label__False right a we are
__label__False thanks adam
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah it s
__label__False yeah there certainly is that yeah
__label__False in the presentation
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False so is the end of the month still the the d
__label__False yeah but it s it s it s it s right i yeah it s more
__label__False so not
__label__False oh really ok
__label__False so
__label__False the uh the the remote
__label__False and they basically said they have they have uh a tool they developed themselves and they ca nt give away uh f it s too errorprone and had it s not supported a a a and
__label__False what wa the other problem oh
__label__False i did nt e
__label__False let you you start
__label__False uh so you have three she sheet one is the um proposalone system actually it s not exe exactly proposalone it s the system that
__label__False yeah
__label__False so is the is the is the training is the training based on these label file which you take a reference here
__label__False uh it may be free to academic like i i do nt know
__label__False so
__label__False you do nt find that usage uh uh i checked for it in the brown national corpus the walk into it never really mean w a in walked smack
__label__False you know or some such thing
__label__False i have here the same frame for the clean speech the same cle but they are a difference because here the fft is only with two hundred fiftysix point and this is with five hundred twelve
__label__False it s clean training well close microphone training and distant microphone um high speed i think well
__label__False yeah
__label__False i is that independent or related to also being able to write out the uh feature file i in the sri format f r
__label__False no
__label__False so uh yeah i mean it doe nt magically make ambiguity go away
__label__False ok
__label__False the the weird thing is that actually delay in some beamforming is not is not the clever thing to do the the the underwater guy do this stuff which is different
__label__False i mean you you have now several stage of smoothing so to say you start up
__label__False yeah so the b b biggest classification would be the speech and silence
__label__False just because it force u to be specific about the value here
__label__False yeah so you know all yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh sure terminology is always context dependent no question about it
__label__False yeah but there s
__label__False no no no no no no no this not no
__label__False you can definitely change the the filter bank from being uh a uh trapezoidal integration to a a a triangular one which is what the typical mel mel cepstral uh filter bank doe
__label__False what s going on at the end of the tool or whatever
__label__False i wa eh look at eh nnn the difference speech file um for example eh if eh we use the ehm the mixed file to to transcribe the the event and the word
__label__False i expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch a it wa the case for the
__label__False so i mean that s pretty quick to run it it s um
__label__False great
__label__False mfcc
__label__False uh yeah and yeah r right so uh who know
__label__False no gain
__label__False yeah depends on which one you mean
__label__False so then if they do have acc
__label__False yeah i mean similar to what what you see really u in in the real um noisy situation
__label__False a b oh it s a s sort of feature normalization t uh like f speaker adaptation which uh which i wr which i wrote about in the last status report which seems to be helping about a percent and a half on
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm yeah but i think
__label__False a
__label__False you know that if some peopl if you re actually are getting at something that ha some conceptual substance to it it will port
__label__False so
__label__False i could
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah no it s that s the good thing about these pape paper deadline and uh you know class project and and thing like that because you you really get g yeah
__label__False if it s done right and if you have data then there are technique for learning the number given the structure and there are even technique for learning the structure although that take a lot more data and it s not a and so forth and so on so uh but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise
__label__False it is different in previous year eurospeech only had the abstract due by now not the full paper
__label__False or that wa the last one that w filled up and de still had like last time i looked it wa like seven gig or something so
__label__False right so your your point is and i think it s a good one that we could just get more disk and put it there
__label__False that s what we should do
__label__False it s it s it would be able to handle any error so if they make on the average that many and it cost them more time to do something different than what they re doing which i do nt know but if it doe then we could try doing that a a postprocess and um have a student or a transcriber run this alignment or we can do it and then you can iteratively figure out where the problem are
__label__False um
__label__False but but we c but i think you know we get some scattered thing from this and that and i i d i do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the with the radio uh i i have better contact in radio than in television but
__label__False hmm
__label__False i think what the landscape is like
__label__False oh
__label__False doe this so if you had an overlap involving three people how many time wa that counted
__label__False ok
__label__False di did you have anything n that s going on or
__label__False uh you could but the thing is what he s talking about here is a uh a translation to a perframe feature vector
__label__False i mean we were getting uh lot better recognition using that than
__label__False i d say we re done
__label__False right put morgan always like this and
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False there is because there is lda filtering but that s perhaps not uh the best w m well
__label__False yeah
__label__False they re might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False if you agree to participate you ll have the opportunity to have anything ex anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set
__label__False transcript one two one one dash one two three zero nine
__label__True oh i think it s july fifteenth is that it
__label__False yeah i mean a lot of the open source pro project face this same problem
__label__False five seven six four five six seven zero four six nine three
__label__False rhetorical construction yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__True uh and about the f the length of the filter and
__label__False and some of these are rather uh unexpected
__label__False wait a minute so
__label__False cuz otherwise i wa gon na say we have to cancel
__label__False the reason i say the demo doe nt work very well is yesterday we uh observed everything in favor of taking a tour and it came up a tango right over and over again
__label__False it d help it figure it out
__label__False so are we worrying about that or not for now ok
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False i do nt what their script are set up to do for the aurora stuff but
__label__False right because you would nt want it to start stuttering
__label__False i do nt understand you mean it s throwing out frame
__label__False including cr crossbridges and
__label__False yeah it s around one point one yeah
__label__False right
__label__False that s a whole set of discourse related cue to your middle layer right
__label__False so
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False i m sure there s a commercial event schema in there somewhere
__label__False and uh p the fiftysix percent is like comparable to what the french telecom get but the thirtyfive percent is way off
__label__False and you also can choose your feature in such a way a to prove improve recognition they may not be the same thing
__label__False yeah but you yeah pfff yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False on the test set yeah
__label__False and try it with tidigits
__label__False but they they had
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah noisy timit
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False and
__label__False yeah
__label__False no it it it s say it but it doe nt say it doe nt it d it d yeah it doe nt give the punch line
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False so we have this big thing that we got from ibm which is a fiveprocessor machine
__label__False um yeah
__label__False i i mean a certain number of them did put the word down but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by um a gloss th and thing
__label__False yeah
__label__True but it s after the thresholding so maybe maybe we might do it before yeah
__label__False how about i m in a hurry
__label__False do you want to trade
__label__False but the solution to that is just set the option so it doe nt compute the shape file and it will work and the only problem with that is you ca nt uh zoom out on it you can zoom in but not out
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False that s the that wa the intent of of it basically
__label__False mmm
__label__False i know nancy
__label__False i mean uh
__label__False i mean this maybe it sound paleolithic but but i just thought if you handed them some sheet of paper that said uh here s what wa said in this transcription is it ok with you and if it is here s this other sheet of paper that you sign that say that it s ok and then they d hand it back to you
__label__False work with this i do nt know
__label__False it s fortyfive minute
__label__False i think what we have now
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False then you have this over time and and both kind of measure and uh you might get uh something better
__label__False yeah we may run across one or two more but of course the connection were nt
__label__False and i i have prepared the the pitch tracker now
__label__False yeah right
__label__False whoa
__label__False and in this case only only had to remove beep because that wa th always the error is that they put in it extraneous beep but it s not easy to do because the whole thing get offset and basically it s assigning the wrong speaker to the text and it all get unaligned so it s very difficult to do so it took me several hour just to do that
__label__False yeah but y but you would be anyway
__label__False now i
__label__False and um there s the issue that that they we know what what wa said but do we because people make mistake and stuff
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so um how h how much in in the work they reported how much noisy speech did you need to get uh good enough statistic for the to get this mapping
__label__False wow
__label__False so i i the thing is when
__label__False ok
__label__False so
__label__False people
__label__False i think that s the intention
__label__False so other topic i wanted to talk about are um the darpa demo which i guess since morgan is nt here we ca nt really talk about i just wanted to make sure it wa ready to go
__label__False mmm
__label__False it s always morgan s fault
__label__False i think we still need uh a recording device for the wizard just a tape recorder that s running in a room
__label__False morgan said something about stopping at the end of the year like when we get around a hundred meeting
__label__False anything else
__label__False like
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False but what do you what about if i w i fed it through some kind of um speech processing algorithm that changed the speech rate
__label__False ok great
__label__False it doe nt necessarily work that way
__label__False but it s o k
__label__False and so i i do nt think it ll be a problem we ll have to see but i do nt think it s gon na be a problem
__label__False is that what you re
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False um how are we going to combine with what they ve been focusing on
__label__False um
__label__False but if you looked at it real close you could see the the in intricacy of the of the wall
__label__False experiment yeah
__label__False yeah so it might be four
__label__False uh but cheating is is p sure but chea but cheating is is is pretty commonly used to mean this it really is
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False this is on popcorn or something yeah ok
__label__False and
__label__False actually you maybe you remember this when you in in the old experiment when you ran with the neural net only and did nt have this side path um uh with the the pure feature a well did it make thing better to have the neural net wa it about the same
__label__False hmm
__label__False i think it wa oh yeah i do nt know
__label__False ok
__label__False i agree
__label__False the a the argument i is kind of i in and it s not like we really know but the argument anyway is that um uh we always have the prob i mean discriminative thing are good lda neural net they re good
__label__False everyone so are your microphone on make sure to turn the battery the switch on everybody
__label__False no i think we have to be able to print it out it s not just if they want to print it out i i think
__label__False i i i saw the the speech file collected by eh the fet mike and eh eh signal eh to eh to noise eh relation is eh low
__label__False so what i wa thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading reading the number on the form
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s yeah i mean but and plus the fact that there s also s i mean can you say like
__label__False yes exactly
__label__False yeah exp one s triangular one s trapezoidal so
__label__False right and then how do you go from there to the
__label__False ok
__label__False i mean that s interesting because it it seems like what it s saying is not so much that you got hurt uh because you uh did nt have so much representation of english because in the other case you do nt get hurt any more at least when it seemed like uh it it might simply be a case that you have something that is just much more diverse but you have the same number of parameter representing it
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False the best is to do the smoo smoothing a early a possible
__label__False oh
__label__False can you hear that or should i turn the l volume on
__label__False and are th
__label__False right
__label__False so it s just an idea if if it turn out that
__label__False n s
__label__False well but then there s other change so i mean there s other
__label__False and um uh yeah
__label__False mmm if it s music
__label__False i mean absolutely yeah i m really scared
__label__False so you re saying feed that also into the neural net yeah yeah
__label__False for the france telecom uh spectral subtraction included in the our system the tidigits number are the right one but not for the other system because i did nt test it yet this system including with spectral subtraction on the tidigits data
__label__False i i do nt know if that it probably doe nt mess it up it probably just ignores it if it determines that it s already in the right format or something but the the the two process that happen are a little different
__label__False so doe so th so doe doe um the tidigits database have speaker that are known
__label__False is nt it
__label__False i ll get the door
__label__False yeah it s a little it s uh we ve thought about it before uh t uh to use the example in other paper and it s it s a little complicated
__label__False actually it wa better with slightly better or about th it wa the same with tighter pruning
__label__False that s point three percent
__label__False the vad use uh lda filtered feature also
__label__False january and late march or something like that
__label__False of of nondigits
__label__False i guess that sort of make sense
__label__False yeah
__label__False and i do
__label__True and so um mike shire in his thesis um did a a series of experiment um training lda filter in d on different condition and you were interested in having me repeat this for for this mean subtraction approach is is that right or for these long analysis window i guess is the right way to put it
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False um and inside the word or between the word you now have begin and end tag for overlap so you you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speaker and how their speech relates to the other speaker speech
__label__False so it s mostly well car is stationary
__label__False so that s sort of the best you could hope for
__label__False two hundred
__label__False some of them come from the utterance and some of them are sort of either world knowledge or situational thing right so that you have no distinction between those and ok
__label__False and back up
__label__False um
__label__False uh
__label__False oh
__label__False you you put it over the corner of your ear
__label__True so i mean clearly there s i can talk about the um the parser change on friday at least so
__label__False shoot i i i ca nt remember now what happens at that first one uh i have to look it up and see
__label__False alright
__label__False right and i m now talking on microphone number two uh the wireless microphone number two
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False should we do digit
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__True if you re getting fiftysix here try adding together the probability of all of the voiced phone here and all of the unvoiced phone and see what you get then
__label__False yeah just say ok is ten minute is i mean maybe there s other thing to do that are more clever but this just seemed to be the sort of the obvious thing because again if you make one mistake then everything after that mistake is off
__label__False and he he always talk about these
__label__False um
__label__False it s uh
__label__False it just died
__label__False so the reason i d like you to understand uh what s going on in this demo system is not because it s important to the research it s just for closure so that if we come up with a question of
__label__False ha
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False eight eight one two two six seven four one nine
__label__False well someone who s associated with the meeting could have like a summary of point handled in the meeting you know maybe if we could pay one person who know that subject matter to do an outline of the meeting s content
__label__False do you wan na go sunil maybe we ll just start with you
__label__False however these are of course then the the node the observed node for your middle layer
__label__False yeah
__label__False well it s a thought
__label__False and maybe there s a trivial mapping if you wan na do it and it s e but it
__label__False ok
__label__False mmm
__label__False msg and and plp
__label__False i i mean if you were gon na uh for for this purpose that is
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um but they re faster
__label__False yeah i mean y you d have to actually run it continuously but it s
__label__False you know if uh uh the example i wa giving wa that if if you had um onset of voicing and and end of voicing a being two kind of event then if you had those a all marked correctly and you counted cooccurrences you should get it completely right
__label__False we re probably a little more than that because we re using up some space that we should nt be on
__label__False training is longer
__label__False i ll send an email make a time suggestion
__label__False you were nt talking about just overlap were you you were just talking about acoustic event
__label__False maybe i ll send it to the list
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s a little bit
__label__False it s something that s like a a a train of p a pulse train for voiced sound and that s that should be flat for
__label__False ok yeah wonderful um did you run into problem or did you run into not h having time
__label__False ok
__label__False i looked into uh spatial description so we can generate spatial description how to get from a to b
__label__False well it it well it d be preceded by i m reading transcript soandso
__label__False it just sends me the time interval and then at some point i ll incorporate them all and put bleep
__label__False i do nt know whether i understand what you mean but again in this
__label__False yeah he might have
__label__False well they they re very perce they ll so one of them said well you know he really said n not really and so what what should i do with that and i said well for our purpose
__label__False yeah so that d be anoth another interesting data point i mean i i guess i m saying i do nt know if we d want to do that a the a
__label__False yeah
__label__False well well high low is pretty straightforward yeah
__label__False i think it ll work
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False they re not mutually exclusive
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False huh
__label__False i can give a i wa just telling this to jane and and
__label__False thilo eh working eh with a new class not only eh nonspeech and speech but eh in in in the speech class dividing eh speech eh of from a speaker and overlapping to try to to do eh eh a fast a fast eh experiment to to prove that nnn this fea eh general feature eh can solve the the the problem and wh what nnn how far is
__label__True i i still have a hunch that there s it s in there some place but it may be given that you have a limited time here it it just may not be the best thing to to to focus on for the remaining of it so pitchrelated and harmonicrelated
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False me
__label__True i have nt started writing the test yet i m meeting with adam today um and he s going t show me the script he ha for um running recognition on mee meeting recorder digit
__label__False it ca nt match up the
__label__False yeah
__label__False right so she is
__label__False uh go ahead
__label__False th d
__label__False well that s the nice thing about it is that i since it s coarse parallelism you do nt have to do anything special
__label__False we re saying about twelve hour
__label__False i think they have one output
__label__False ah ok and then it wo nt
__label__False yeah now you know maybe you d use something from the others just because at the beginning of a call you do nt know anything and so you might have some kind of general thing that s your best guess to start with but
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False s so so if the endpoint if the gothere is yes and no then gothere discourse will just be fiftyfifty
__label__False interesting
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh ok
__label__False ok well if that s what it said
__label__False y you mean just uh on each on each line there s a one word right
__label__False n v yeah ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False you know there are so many thing about this that are nonuniform that i think having having some modicum of uniformity is a good thing but you re just not going to i mean we ve uh
__label__False i think we were gon na work with with this or this new system or with
__label__False uh
__label__False uh so s
__label__False you could what you could do is you could sell little ring and stuff with embedded you know transmitter in them and thing and
__label__False yeah i m did nt have time to to look at that so
__label__False we
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok and the transcriber h i uh do nt have the exact number but i think it would come to about eleven hour that are finished uh transcribing from them right now the next step is to that i m working on is to insure that the data are clean first and then channelized what i mean by clean is that they re spellchecked that the markup is consistent all the way throughout and also that we now incorporate these additional convention that uh liz requested in term of um um in term of having a s a systematic handling of number and acronym which i had nt been specific about
__label__False bhaskara
__label__False did the did they get good result with that
__label__False and uh one of the thing i do nt remember the detail on but i remember at some point when you were working with a second stream and you tried a lowpass filtering to cepstrum in some case you got
__label__False uh so carmen is just looking at the ericsson ericsson code
__label__False you can fill those out uh after actually so
__label__False so this is sort of the st the straightforward approach
__label__False that would j just be one
__label__False ok
__label__False and uh but i do nt know i think he wa wa nt he asking about
__label__False perhaps if the answer have something to do with the question for example
__label__False where where s the meeting
__label__False right right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah mmhmm
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean we don
__label__False hubfive yeah
__label__False terrific
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh
__label__False ok and the pru the question he wa asking at one point about pruning uh
__label__False and so we re doing it via mouse but the whole system wa designed to work with this thing and it wa it wa a lot of engineering stuff
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah but
__label__False fortyfive minute for that one
__label__False yeah well i think in a p you know if if you were going for an evaluation system you d care but if you were doing a live system that people were actually using nobody would notice it s uh i think the thing is to get something that s practical that that you could really use
__label__False well y we can expre we can put this expression
__label__False it s behind the tree from me or something like that i think in in in certain circumstance in english right a sort of from where i m standing it would appear that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep
__label__False thilo s is a good a any probably
__label__False they re gon na hate this meeting
__label__False they got sa apparent
__label__False good
__label__False and um that wa the phoneloop adaptation and then there wa a very small like point one percent on the native uh win from doing um you know adaptation to the recognition hypothesis
__label__False yeah exactly and this is just then just one
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah so there s uh a group at um edinburgh is working on um this mocha database where um they have measurement of um articulatory position so you you put some some pellet on people s tongue and lip and and they can tell and they
__label__False yep
__label__False uh part of it if it work right is wh it look like we re now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same a the construction analyzer that nancy need for the child language modeling
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False i mean we re s we re not we re not in terrible shape
__label__False oh ok
__label__False and then we cut in half by
__label__False doe that make sense
__label__False actually no th th
__label__False but you have the distance to work with
__label__False the they they will be aud adhoc for for for some time to come
__label__False ooo
__label__False oh it doe
__label__False that s his major
__label__False so can we do we do another set are we are we are we sort of we talked out about what we re
__label__True how however i suggest that if you if you look at your email carefully you may think you may find that you already have it
__label__False really that big
__label__False yeah yeah you you caught up yep that s true
__label__False that headphone the headphone that you have to put on backwards with the little little thing and the little little foam block on it
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and uh
__label__True di did i send you some result without adaptation
__label__False i did look into that uh in term of you know exploding the node out and down ag
__label__False i think it would be very helpful
__label__False ok
__label__False yikes
__label__False ok
__label__False so what i m saying is maybe that s not a killer because you re just getting some characterization one that s driven by your intuition about voicedunvoiced certainly but it s just some characterization of something back in the in the in the almost raw data rather than the smooth version
__label__False yeah i i i i
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh and you re putting it all together ignoring the difference in context
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False th we wanted them to be to be typical of what would be in a pda so they are they re not the pzm three hundred dollar type they re the twentyfive cent buy them in pack of thousand type
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False well we have step forward
__label__False right
__label__False say hi for me
__label__False oh yeah i know what i wa go w
__label__False so
__label__False so actually this is in between what we had with the previous vad and what sunil did with an idl vad
__label__False ok cool
__label__False how long would it take to to add another node on the observatory and um play around with it
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmmhmm
__label__False everything
__label__True uh well in in some email that uh we had
__label__False yeah it doe look good i mean i found several error but they were not significant
__label__False yep
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False and um let s make those four
__label__False i mean i think um i m more worried about thing being kept in a funky state long enough that that uh stuff get broken or or you know
__label__False right
__label__False but the other is uh yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there d be a bakery in the neighborhood or um pfff you know you wonder how people here make their living and there re all sort of reason why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery that doe nt mean i want to buy some baked good
__label__False right
__label__False that s true
__label__False that wa with zero literature search
__label__False that s
__label__False and that might help cue the transcriptionist
__label__False and the whole breakdown thing kinda make sense
__label__False one five eight five one two eight nine three
__label__False right
__label__False oh ok
__label__False kind of done actually i wa gon na
__label__False it s difficult
__label__False yeah
__label__False um so i m i m thinking about um starting some uh cheating experiment to uh determine the um the relative effectiveness of um some intermediate category that i want to classify
__label__False yeah that s right
__label__False well maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech wh
__label__False oh ok
__label__False oh good good
__label__False but you think if you include that plus the other feature
__label__False well the and the other thing is it take only a a minute to rescore all the old output with if you had new transcript then we j we just re rescore the old
__label__False so it wa a f f a phonetic classification system for the italian aurora data
__label__False hmm
__label__False oh i
__label__False right i mean yeah generally in these thing you you turn back pruning really far so
__label__False i think the date s written in there yep and actually if everyone could cross out the rnine next to session and write mr eleven
__label__False then i
__label__False uh well
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False shorten
__label__False yeah
__label__False no
__label__False yep
__label__False this th
__label__False out
__label__False that s a difference that i do nt think we put any way to get around since it wa an advantage um uh but we did eh we did hear this comment from people at some point that um it uh they got some better result with the triangular filter rather than the trapezoidal so that is an option in rasta
__label__False yeah
__label__False one five five two seven three eight nine two
__label__False and it seems to work i ve i m sort of fiddling with the parameter to get it to actually generate something and i have nt i do nt what i m working on wa working on wa getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have into transcriber
__label__False ok
__label__False so in general they ll be binding across both intention and the action so
__label__False yeah uh
__label__False based on the web site yeah at the
__label__False i wonder if you could do an adaptor i do nt know if you can or not
__label__False i yeah so i would think exploratory thing now
__label__False your mike is a little low there
__label__False yeah
__label__False i do nt know if we can get some handlabeled data from other language
__label__False and this um m wo nt differentiate between all mode yeah but at least it ll tell u ok here we have something that somebody that want to go someplace now it s up for u to figure out what kind of going there is is is happening and um if the discourse take a couple of turn before everything all the information is needed what happens is you know the parser par it and then it s handed on to the discourse history which is um o one of the most elaborate elaborate module it s it s actually the the whole memory of the entire system that know what wh who said what which wa what wa presented it help an an anaphora resolution and it and it fill in all the structure that are omitted so um because you say ok how can i get to the castle
__label__False hmm
__label__False show u the way bhaskara
__label__False so why do nt you make it multiple file
__label__False so there are like some some s some parameter you wanted to use or something or yeah
__label__False it doe nt require it own training data it just share that state
__label__False yeah
__label__False i i really would like to suggest looking um a little bit at the kind of error i know you can get lost in that and go forever and not see too much but sometimes but but um just seeing that each of these thing did nt make thing better may not be enough it may be that they re making them better in some way and worse in others or increasing insertion and decreasing deletion or or um um you know helping with noisy case but hurting in quiet case and if you saw that then maybe you it would something would occur to you of how to deal with that
__label__False this is so so basically our our position is that um we should nt be unduly constraining the latency at this point because we re all still experimenting with trying to make the performance better in the presence of noise
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right ok
__label__False oh hang on
__label__False plus it would make for interesting noise background noise
__label__False no first year coming so she s she s now out here she s moved and she ll be a student a of then and probably she ll pick up from you on the beliefnet stuff so sh she ll be chasing you down and stuff like that
__label__False yeah and and there will be a a a relatively high level of redundancy in the sense that um ultimately one so th so that if we want to get really cocky we we will say well if you really look at it you just need our rad
__label__False i have to look at that but i m not sure that they are
__label__False or
__label__False we are able to we were able to observe that w the element um of the location that the car is near
__label__False ca nt you just you just put them on
__label__False o two seven four o zero two three one nine zero nine one three o two eight nine o two eight three five four
__label__False right
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False well the
__label__False hmm
__label__False chafe speaks about intonation unit
__label__False ok
__label__False the
__label__False uh four kind of feature the plp the plp with jrasta the msg and the mfcc from the baseline aurora
__label__False hello hello
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False maybe we shouldnt ve subsampled it down to sixteen bit for our first try
__label__False he s at two nine seven seven
__label__False read and write do nt hurt them too much unless you scratch them
__label__False yeah
__label__False so we found this this uh this macrophone data and so forth that we were using for these other experiment to be pretty good so that s i after you explore these other alternative that might be another way to start looking is is just improving the training set
__label__True can you maximize the window
__label__False and then uh he doe some fine tuning um for um special case
__label__False and they they have to
__label__False i i th
__label__False yeah uh exactly so in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place you also apparently have this proximaldistal thing which is very deeply uh embedded
__label__False this is that i looked at
__label__False i think probably the bottom four bit are not any good
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i think we re already gon na i mean there s already some chance that different annotation different place you know
__label__False we were th
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh um
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False forceful
__label__False it s just that i i mean you re right that there s more poten if we never say anybody s name then there s no chance of of of slandering anybody but
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False and we can uh put this inside
__label__False um so i m taking this qualifier exam that s coming up in two week and i i finish writing a proposal and submit it to the committee um
__label__False uh
__label__False mmm
__label__False and it allows you to show m many different resolution so there s a little user interface component that let you sh select the resolution
__label__False no
__label__False that s not a bad idea at all so that uh
__label__False should we take turn you want me to run it today
__label__True yeah and i sent you an email with the instruction
__label__False ok
__label__False this is this is ti digit we re looking at this whole page is tidigits or this is
__label__False yeah and
__label__False i have just because it s such an un
__label__False it s the hotel zum ritter which is the only renaissance building in heidelberg that wa left after the big destruction and for the thirty year war blahblahblah
__label__False i have to go
__label__False well i can do that but then i have to end the presentation in the middle so i can go back to open up javabayes
__label__False well you know it s not but
__label__False but um he in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already um existing interface which might already have these property so do you wan na say something about that
__label__False uh because we still have even once we choose we ve still got uh another month or so i mean there s holiday in the way but but uh
__label__False they would know their place darn it
__label__False yeah
__label__False i i did nt think it would be that big a deal because i wa figuring well you have it turned back so far that you know it
__label__False so here here i mean i found that it s if i changed the noise estimate i could get an improvement
__label__False i wa wondering if there s maybe um certain setting of the parameter when you compute plp which would basically cause it to output mel cepstrum
__label__False we do nt have yet um
__label__False so pay a visit uh uh d
__label__False oh that s a good idea that s that would be a good match
__label__False so um i think the hope would be that it would uh it would work well for the good case and uh it would have reasonable reas soft degradation a you got to worse and worse condition um
__label__False right exactly
__label__False is there any point which you think that you know you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it cuz it could be that you d look through it and you say well this is just the wrong task for for him to pursue his
__label__False how do you pronounce your name
__label__False it doe nt know i
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah he might he might be asking
__label__False this is adam on the wireless headset transcript eight five five two zero six seven o o seven six eight nine eight nine
__label__False yeah they will have no more linguistic matter in front of them when they enter this room
__label__False exactly my point an and so this is the expectation thing that uh uh just the dyadic but in addition you know if someone ha done this analysis himself and is nt involved in the dyad but they might also give backchannels to verify what what the answer is that this that the the answerer s given
__label__False so i wa trying uh with full band and multiple band m p uh separating them to different frequency band and deriving separate decision on each band and trying to combine them
__label__False um i d like someone who s more familiar with it to look at it because when i wa looking at it we seemed to have lot of stuff going on when no one s saying anything
__label__False ok so w so what doe that mean for how we are gon na organize thing
__label__False oh i should nt say it that way because that doe sound like fortyhour week no
__label__False aha
__label__False or where is x located at nuh
__label__False um
__label__False sorry
__label__False this is dan and this is transcript number four three nine four seven one eight five six seven zero four six nine eight nine nine two three
__label__False oh and we re just chatting
__label__False that s that s so that s a that s a very good question then now that it
__label__False uh
__label__False i do nt know um
__label__False so all of those
__label__False yeah but we know that
__label__False mr eleven
__label__False yeah
__label__False it also raise the possibility of um using that kind of representation i mean i do nt know this d be something we d wan na check but maybe using that representation for data entry and then displaying it on the channelized uh representation cuz it i think that the
__label__False nope
__label__False no
__label__False and people talking about picture and pictorial representation and um
__label__False o three o six five one three zero five zero two three one two three o o eight two two eight five two one five six two seven four three two four eight nine eight
__label__False yeah so you have to make
__label__False mmm
__label__False i do nt know how much the structure of the evolving bayesnet will af affect like we wan na we wan na be able to collect a much of the variable that are needed for that right in the course of the task
__label__False right
__label__False i mean it they they probably have some fi particular s fixed point arithmetic that they re using and then it just
__label__False just beyond that
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so i guess we ll try to write this eurospeech paper i mean we will write it whether they accept it late or not i do nt know
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh and the grouping are important so yo you re supposed to pause between the grouping
__label__False so basically the spectrum of the excitation for a purely periodic sig signal shou sh e
__label__False yep
__label__False and so you know we wan na be able to show off to somebody you know we have a base station somewhere and you re wandering around uh hand free and
__label__False so it s all just scratch
__label__False what kind of uh frontend processing did you do
__label__False transcript two nine five one two nine seven o six o three o nine seven eight zero
__label__False yeah
__label__False i have it downstairs i do nt remember off the top of my head
__label__False something yeah
__label__False sure
__label__False ok but that mean that you re gon na have to be available for people all the time who say there s an error here rather than just them just going in and correcting it
__label__False we have all sort of cdroms from a long time ago
__label__False oh it s just a constant amount over all
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False yeah i mean i i still am not entirely sure that i really fully grasp the syntax of this you know like what
__label__False that s a different thing what if the context which is not set but still they say thing like i want to go uh see the uh the the castle and uh et cetera
__label__False well
__label__False um yeah but so kamal ha uh
__label__False but now you guy have seen the light so
__label__False yeah
__label__False i i do nt remember anymore
__label__False derived i do nt know if i u
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False not really it s three to four per week
__label__False well regardless well first of all there wa um a problem with the archive in that i wa every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directory an or recursive chmod and chown because they were nt getting set correctly every once in a while and i wa just doing a minus r star not realizing that that caused it to be rebackedup
__label__False yeah
__label__False so that ha nothing to do with economics or anything
__label__False so
__label__False ok
__label__False oh oh ok i see
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah so the idea is that the very lowest frequency and and typically the veriest highest frequency are kind of junk
__label__False well or she should be free after that so assuming she s coming to this meeting
__label__False well hynek showed up one suddenly on one day and then i wa t talking wi
__label__False did nt we already get that cuz you you ca nt have uh component tolerance that are uh sixteen million one in sixteen million part so
__label__False and what s nancy doing
__label__False what do you mean
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i sh actually should ve picked a different one because that could be why the pda is worse
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s the uh twenty nineteenth
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh it doe nt oh ok
__label__False ok so just dis dismiss everything
__label__False we just w
__label__False yeah if you re using the baseline
__label__False we have the original wavefile with all the beep
__label__False seven two six two one two six five nine eight
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone
__label__False well i don i would nt call reading digit meeting
__label__False to the l
__label__False yeah that s a good question i yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False after the b after the noise compensation n i wa trying t to f find a f feature based on the ratio of the energy that is cl after clean and before clean
__label__False sure
__label__True uh i m leaving next wednesday
__label__False well if they k en if they record a meeting and they create a key file and they find an error in their key file they should nt have to tell u about that so that they can create correct an error in one of their file
__label__False so wait the simplest thing is you cheat saying
__label__False so uh demo status first of all i did a little thing for liz with the transcriber tool that um first of all it us the forced alignment so that the word appear uh in their own segment rather than in long in long chunk she said that that she thought that wa a much better idea for the other stuff she s working on
__label__False right
__label__False well
__label__False i see ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False six five four zero four one five zero five eight eight two
__label__False um what wa it there wa there wa some some some point where eh uh eric or somebody wa wa speaking and he had lot of silence in his channel and i wa saying something to somebody else uh which wa in the background and it wa not it wa recognizing my word which were the background speech on the close close mike
__label__False so um uh that s one one aspect of it
__label__False thanks well well why do nt we he he s worried about a ticket why do nt we do a simultaneous one
__label__False that s very good
__label__False yeah i went through the feacalc code and then looked at you know just calling the rasta libs and thing like that and i did nt i could nt see any wh place where that kind of thing wa done
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False so w where it should illustrate uh wh when you say all this do you mean like i do nt know the related work stuff a well a mapping
__label__False it seems like whatever they choose they should nt you know purposefully braindamage a part of the system to make a worse baseline or you know
__label__False yeah
__label__False there d be some kind of mark in front of it
__label__False f sorry
__label__False there wa uh a statement made uh which i do nt think is right by the way but there wa a statement made at the uh darpa communicator meeting i wa at recently that um microphone multiple microphone at a distance of le than three foot or something like that were totally useless completely irrelevant
__label__False so
__label__False it should be very rare
__label__False and so you just want to find out what the filter are the filter roughly act like a um a uh a an overall resonant you know f some resonance and so forth that th that s processing excitation
__label__False yeah
__label__False but it doe nt
__label__False yeah but but the the chunk are already sh i in general are short so i i t i think it would be better to have to have more of them concatenated together in order to have better language model or language modeling
__label__False oh i just i just h put the second stream in place and uh ran one experiment but just like just to know that everything is fine
__label__False oh is nt ben
__label__False yes
__label__False and so uh i have a
__label__False i
__label__False yeah but again that s just log energy a opposed to filter bank energy yeah
__label__False well then
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm ok
__label__False so if that s at an
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the uh the system um i can show you the system i actually want at least maybe you should be able to start it on your own
__label__False oh i see then oh i see ok
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False because eh eh i per perhaps
__label__False there s the attribute called no what s that called uh n no uh noevict
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False temporal lda
__label__False until you re yep
__label__False spurt ha the horrible name overloading with other with hardware at icsi
__label__False this one
__label__False yeah couple hour
__label__False um
__label__False so the the result that i ve shown here are the complete result using the new
__label__False did nt bother i knew it when i said it i remember s thinking oh that s not correctly pronounced but it but i thought it s not worth fixing cuz often when you re speaking everybody know what what you mean
__label__False i think if they re processing it at
__label__False do y do you think that would speed it up
__label__False the one question is definitely clear with anything a opposed to just what you said
__label__False they seem to be well the semester actually is starting up
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh we can prove that the this kind o emph emphasizes parameter and gaussian
__label__False we will
__label__False it they and then in curly bracket they say laughter now they re they re not being awfully precise uh m so they re two type of laughter that are not being distinguished one is when sometimes s someone will start laughing when they re in the middle of a sentence
__label__False right
__label__False probably the fact that it pick up other people s speaker other people s talking is an indication of that it the fact it is a good microphone
__label__False yeah but
__label__False right
__label__False i do nt remember getting anything
__label__False right
__label__False so it s it s three or three and four
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False nnn
__label__False that element or object
__label__False i just approved all mine i did nt look at them
__label__False and the mmm what s in the table just at the left of the plp twelve online normalization column so the number seventynine fiftyfour and uh fortytwo are the result obtained by uh pratibha with uh his online normalization uh her online normalization approach
__label__False well we do nt need to do it during this meeting we have a little more to discus
__label__False but if it s a problem of extra beep rather than missing beep then um that s easier and it might work oh
__label__False so instead of designing our own new wiener filter i may just use one of those carlos filter in in this implementation and see whether it it actually give me something better than using just the current f current frame which is in a way uh something like the smoothing the wiener filter but
__label__False i just tested it on speechdatcar
__label__False yes
__label__False right
__label__False but two second is pretty long so
__label__False well
__label__False no no what feed it what feature doe it see
__label__False bu e e e i m even
__label__False yeah sure but uh
__label__False ok
__label__False it s just the noise from the connection and the everything
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False actually it
__label__False ok
__label__True right and the the uh result are due like the day before the meeting or something
__label__False i mean
__label__False yeah we uh use timit on this for
__label__False well i
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False right so i so i i this is
__label__False so if you ever get to the generation side of constructing thing and there might be something of interest there but in the moment we re of course definitely focused on the understanding um pipeline
__label__False then uh i talked a little bit about um continuing with these dynamic ev um acoustic event and um we re we re we re thinking about a way to test the completeness of a a set of um dynamic uh event
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok fine
__label__False yes it would be cuz it s very very regular
__label__False so so that is uh
__label__False and um i grabbed the sample stuff but i have nt uh compiled it
__label__False you re
__label__False i mean so it s like i in a way it s it s nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and and hear the transcript to have that be the
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s there s a
__label__False to uh the to have have all this ad all this uh adaptation
__label__False you re on one
__label__False ten meeting that have been sent to ibm
__label__False not the slide show
__label__False just that task
__label__False and i ve been sharing them with ud uw folk also
__label__False so they changed the whole thing so that there s no delay for that compression and part also
__label__False yeah right
__label__False twoth
__label__False ta task data we are u
__label__False maybe we can ask him about it
__label__False it s uh aalborg in denmark and it s yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False the ext the the the extension right
__label__False i mean
__label__True i mean chuck s suggestion of just two beep is nice because then you could have them actually transcribe hbeep or lbeep high beep or low beep
__label__False so why not
__label__False maybe you re right yeah cuz it wa getting like one percent
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False e is equal oh to log of
__label__False right
__label__False well
__label__False so uh this is morgan again with the wireless lapel transcript nine five seven three five three seven nine six nine seven eight zero
__label__False the b the combination of the biology and the leipzig connection might be interesting to these guy yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False i think um certainly u meeting recorder
__label__False well then you can just
__label__False it might be worth uh asking around like we looked at sort of uh a page that had like a bunch of
__label__False oh that s great
__label__False and you you might
__label__False and then we have for example an object type hmm that s a hotel how about hotel
__label__False could nt you have a third category
__label__False so it s using all the net for that but again we have the hope that it
__label__False the the reason that i generated the mixed file wa for
__label__False well y
__label__False so who would be the subject of this trial run
__label__False the initial thing is just the obvious that we re discussing is starting up with phone label from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation
__label__False yeah
__label__False well you c you you s
__label__False so doe doe the periodicity of this signal say something about the the the pitch ok
__label__False that s that s really great stuff to to do that in relatively short time
__label__False right
__label__False and and
__label__False is it the firstorder expansion yeah i guess yeah uhhuh
__label__False ok
__label__False improvement
__label__False yeah i wa just gon na say maybe it ha something to do with hardware something they were doing
__label__False yeah well see if you add something everywhere it ha almost no effect up up up on on top
__label__False yeah so the uh
__label__False oh i did nt know that
__label__False ok uh that is you know use your best knowledge of of the domain to uh hypothesize what the dependency are and stuff
__label__False so tha that s exactly what the pfile is for
__label__False well not the one that
__label__False uh we so we now know
__label__False so everybody know there were these guy f uh from heidelber uh uh actually from uh dfki uh part of the german smartkom project who were here for the week and i think got a lot done
__label__False so so let s say we k
__label__False ok
__label__False iram bigram you know
__label__False well no because we
__label__False broadcast news and so on that s why c cambridge switched to plp i think
__label__False and then from there we do um
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False babble subway right and and street is nt train station yeah
__label__False yeah it s something that that we definitely need to look at with this
__label__False i think a long a you guy agree on it it doe nt matter i think we have a maximum of sixty uh feature that we re allowed so
__label__False and it s it s case insensitive yeah
__label__False chicken run
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s a big difference yeah
__label__False so i think we ll use a much data a we have at a particular time and we ll we ll concatenate utterance together um to get a much data a we possibly can from the user but um there s a question of how to set up the model so um we could train the model if we think twelve second is ideal we could train the model using twelve second to calculate the mean to mean subtract the training data or we could um use some other amount so like i did an experiment where i um wa using six second in test um but for i tried twelve second in train and i tried um um the same in train i m a i tried six second in train and six second in train wa about point three percent better
__label__False oh
__label__False babble it s a stationary background plus some voice some speech over it and the other two are rather stationary also
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok but eh i think it s not eh common
__label__False um
__label__False oh yeah then we should
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False although yeah
__label__False that s true
__label__False um i did nt do it word level but but in term so i so for for one of the n a group and also i went back to the original one that i first transcribed and and did it w uh w uh utterance by utterance for that particular one so i think you do have if that s a sufficient unit i think that you do have handmarking for that but it d be wonderful to be able to benefit from your wave stuff
__label__False cuz y you know
__label__False so let s i guess
__label__False yes
__label__False um even though there is probably no train from here to new york right
__label__False this is i that s what you s it seemed like explained it to me earlier w
__label__False they re separate thing
__label__False yeah
__label__True yeah we do nt know what their process is so i had two idea the first wa to provide them a text template that had both the beep in it and the speaker id
__label__False oh
__label__False we do nt need the word to that
__label__False actually this this um so there s another paper it s a eurospeech paper but not related to meeting
__label__False what s the situation like at the entity that is mentioned if we know anything about it is it under construction
__label__False i do nt know how complicated it is to go from there
__label__False no
__label__True yeah and um if you can get that binding point also maybe with a nice example that would be helpful for johno and me
__label__False hmm
__label__False right
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False nine three nine six zero five four seven seven
__label__False ok so one thing i i m you know unsure about is how we have the discus uh the admission fee thing set up
__label__False the other thing is that you actually have direction here so unlike these corpus that are recorded with other microphone like the right way to do this i guess w you know in the future would be well in general thilo s sitting there and this pzm is gon na you know he s roughly in that location
__label__False i do nt know exactly because we tried we some one experiment that doe nt work
__label__False actually i start mmm i do nt wait to a fifteen twentyfive twentyfive frame before computing a mean and the variance to e to to start the recursion
__label__False um
__label__False uh let me check uh
__label__False five two seven one six one zero five eight one
__label__False so you re saying the the sequence would be more like first adam go to the contact list contact them via whatever their preferred method is to see if they want to review the meeting
__label__False oh that s this is a new development ok
__label__False we improve
__label__False and then just back into transcriber transcriber format
__label__False yeah
__label__False then there s s a larger piece that s been recorded and uh put on cdrom and sent uh to ibm
__label__False um but i i did not focus on that aspect but um
__label__False ok
__label__False and the last condition is close microphone for training and distant for testing
__label__False mmm i did
__label__False ah so comfortable
__label__False yeah
__label__False tsk
__label__False um
__label__False it s not a bad idea
__label__False no no
__label__False right
__label__False ok i wan na do that at this place sort of make up their own itinerary a and and task and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h high level category list with them but uh the person is able to take note on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist s sort of schematic representation with with symbol for the object and so the person can maybe make a mental note that ah yeah i wanted to go shopping here and i wanted to maybe take a picture of that and maybe um eat here and then go in and solves the task with the system ie fey and um and we re gon na try out that any question
__label__False but this sort of get the job done in that respect and maybe it is even conceptually somewhat adequate in a sense that um we re talking about two different thing we re talking more on the sort of intention level up there and more on the this is the your basic bone um schema down there
__label__False i mean there s also thing like i mean s um i guess
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False now uh why
__label__False ok
__label__False unless it boot up with networking
__label__False one of the thing that i think is a little a little bit of a limitation there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work we probably ca nt do it every week
__label__False yeah yep
__label__False or more generally i guess what what is causing the degradation
__label__False ibm thing
__label__False we did unreasonable thing which because we like to try strange thing and and uh and our thing worked too
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False five two seven two eight six one seven
__label__False oh i see
__label__False it s just a word in the language model cool
__label__False but in english that s not really a problem unless we get some some topical german movie that have just come out and that are in their database
__label__False it it said the same amount because for convenience sake in the particular way that this is being tested uh they were repeating the packet
__label__False two eight four three three six two three o eight five four
__label__False exactly
__label__False um
__label__False just the clip
__label__False right
__label__False it might also depend on which speaker th it is and how close they are to the pzm i do nt know how different they are from each other
__label__False hmm
__label__False right quicknet is a very nice streambased library so without too much effort once he ha the class written we can incorporate it into all the standard tool
__label__False that s the opposite of constructional that s you know that s that s hpsg or whatever you know
__label__False six six three eight o four o five eight four six eight
__label__False nine five three seven zero two one eight
__label__False anything
__label__False well not only a word level but actually i mean you did nt need to show the exact point of interruption you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt or
__label__False so that is the probability that they re entering vistaing or tangoing and uh
__label__False but it s my ear i m sure it s something wrong with my head but
__label__False that s not even ready so um ok go on t to uh whatever
__label__False i do nt know uh it s i i i it s because it s what we did for the first proposal we tested uh trying to go down and yeah
__label__False and i m sorry by the result of overlapping because eh i have nt good result eh yet but eh
__label__False and um the other thing uh wa uh uh
__label__False yeah certainly you can get some
__label__False a long a the len a long the segment are long enough
__label__False wait a minute th th the
__label__False yeah right right
__label__False yeah
__label__False i th i saw that
__label__False yeah it s a very short time yeah yeah
__label__False cool
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but by by the moment i i do nt compare my my temporal mark with eh jane but eh
__label__False if we call that one then what you re saying is that the word error rate for the same language but using uh different training data than you re testing on say timit and so forth it s one point one
__label__False so should we simply assert that this week we are recognition and next week data issue and
__label__True uh ibm transcription status
__label__False i do nt know yet the what happened tuesday but the point that they were supposed to discus is still uh thing like the weight uh
__label__False and so there is kind of reduction of the information there that s not correct because if we change task and if the phoneme are not in the same context in the new task obviously the decision boundary are not should not be at the same place
__label__False well actually the audio file are pretty fast too
__label__False um we ve trained uh several neural network on so on the tidigits english and on the italian data and also on the broad uh english uh french and uh spanish database
__label__False cuz i think what s certainly characteristic of a lot of the data in this test is that um you do nt have the the training set may not be a a great estimator for the noise in the test set sometimes it is and sometimes it s not
__label__False uh but you are not doing it now language dependent or
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False no no no he s saying get a whole different drive
__label__False ok
__label__False well although we wanted to get alignment from the close mike stuff
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False and um they they differed in some respect but they e em one wa called the french telecom alcatel system the other wa called the alcatel french telecom system uh which is the biggest difference i think
__label__False ok
__label__False digit yep
__label__False sorry
__label__False so you always need the whole body of of y your model um to figure out what belongs to what or you always send it along with it nuh so you always send up here i am i am this person and i can have these parent in every message which e
__label__False yeah so i would try to somewhat reduce this
__label__False i
__label__False ok
__label__False depends how fast you can throw it it s just
__label__False ok
__label__False and maybe there are two um
__label__False i ll get it for you
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False for htk
__label__False yeah it s bark scale and it s it it um it actually copy the uh um the second filter over to the first so the first filter are always and you can s you can specify a different number of uh feature different number of filter i think a i recall
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah i i
__label__False oh oh you re downloading a whole meeting
__label__False actually liz will like it you know but
__label__False ok
__label__False so it s twentyfour twentyfour feature
__label__False maybe
__label__False and and and uh but y you know i i should also say that there s a lot of it s not just the word cheating but there s lot of other thing that we talk about which a soon a you go outside of your narrow little group it get very very confusing to people
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah within huh
__label__False hold down at hold down alt and then tap tab several time and you ll cycle through all the open application
__label__False no if i i
__label__False i do nt know what they said but i know the number
__label__False yeah the so yeah
__label__False so you want to have a a node for like whether or not it can be entered
__label__False i think there s an argument for having you know you could use our old file server for for disk that have data that is very rarely accessed and then have a fast new file server for data that is um heavily accessed
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah so i i guess some of the progress i i ve been getting a getting my committee member for the quals
__label__False um so um the one th one thing i know that we have on that is uh we had talked a a couple week before um uh about the uh the stuff you were doing with with uh um uh l l attempting to locate event we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by event but
__label__False i just did the configuration that s very similar to what we did for the february proposal
__label__False so but basically that s one of the main change
__label__False i mean it s true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue in in uh the other
__label__False right
__label__False if we if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the word then we can leverage that a lot by some clever cross thing to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this probably
__label__False i mean when you observe a node
__label__False my suggestion is that robert and johno sort of give u a report on last week s adventure uh to start
__label__False a professionally a i guess you can get it done
__label__True uh i wan na look at these number offline a little bit and think about it and and talk with everybody uh outside of this meeting
__label__False but it sound like a k a a a short conversation with brian might be might be helpful to get a sense of what s going on
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False wa uh
__label__False oh that would be interesting
__label__False but a a a th
__label__False ok
__label__False uh is it
__label__False five four three six two six six seven three
__label__False and we have
__label__False and we know
__label__False anything i forgot that we should mention
__label__False which is f
__label__False oh th ok that factor of two
__label__False yeah
__label__False there s only one s in interesting
__label__False i remember when we were transcribing berp uh uh uh ron kay uh volunteered to to do some of that and he wa the first first stuff he did wa transcribing chuck
__label__False so is it it s going to disk or is this
__label__False um sure but i bu
__label__False so this this this is a parallel track you know there they hopefully meet but since
__label__False anyway
__label__False six two eight eight seven five nine one two zero
__label__False so there is this klt part which use just the standard feature and then two neura two neural network
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep
__label__False probably not transcript but it would be nice to have one mechanism for all the file
__label__False no no no
__label__False just curious
__label__False fixed that
__label__False yeah
__label__False i guess it s that um people in his class cover a different set so than the c is the cogsci department that you were talking about uh reaching out to cuz we have you know people from other area
__label__False yeah
__label__False get out of the yeah
__label__False mike
__label__False i m ju i m just jo
__label__False i mean it s if we can actually you know get it so that we can out of one utterance activate more than one schema i mean then we re already pretty good right
__label__False so this is a
__label__False i think we ll just design it
__label__False he s not around is the only problem
__label__False well
__label__False so that s what we need to basically uh to hmm
__label__False so the fact that there there is no uh lowpass filtering before the downsampling
__label__False whether it s a whether it s a public building and whether it s actually ha a door
__label__False like which of the
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah but nnn
__label__False going back i guess two week ago uh robert had laid out this beliefnet missing only the connection right
__label__False uh i changed the code uh and now we have a baseline that s similar to the ogi baseline
__label__False so i just tried it on italian just to know that everything is but i i did nt export anything out of it because it wa like a weird feature set
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False uh
__label__False seven five
__label__False yeah
__label__False if it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment then
__label__False six four seven seven two zero eight two four seven
__label__False so at at the middle o where the arrow are showing that s you re adding one more mixture per state or
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok then i guess that raise the question of uh whether we should screen the data before they get transcribed because although i think that the data are still useful in term of providing content and and that i know that having three out of seven microphone out of commission during some part of the meeting restricts the uh usefulness of the data for other purpose
__label__False hmm
__label__False exactly yeah
__label__False this actually do nt s doe nt seem to help although it doe nt hurt so
__label__False however not only wa the common census were among all participant of friday s meeting wa it s gon na be very laborious to to make these drawing for each different thing all the different action if at all possible and also people will get caught up in the picture so all of a sudden we ll get description of picture in there
__label__False discourselevel construction
__label__False in log domain yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False i could say ah well the the intent here wa whereis and i could look at those
__label__False six six four
__label__False so if it is something the neural net is not able to discriminate the class
__label__False oh it s just uh i ran the recognizer uh the speechnonspeech detector on different channel and it s just in uh in this new multichannel format and output and
__label__False although dave basically said that if we wan na do it just tell him and he ll do a d level zero then
__label__False no i meant um sorry the meeting where people eat their lunch downstairs maybe they do nt wan na be recorded but
__label__False there were quite a few
__label__False yeah i do nt think it s in there i think it s in the uh uh uh the filter
__label__False so you have to take the whole the five there should be five sheet
__label__False i thought it wa like a hundred meg
__label__False so why not use rcs at that point just at that stage
__label__False n
__label__False what about the stuff that um
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False wear out after what amount of time
__label__False middlesized one
__label__False yeah uh yeah we do
__label__False yeah
__label__False h
__label__False and the uh the the run time of the recognizer on the plp feature is longer which sort of implies that the network are bushier you know there s more thing it s considering which go along with the fact that the match are nt a good
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i b i mean roll so
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean so one thing they could do i mean i guess that s true they could simply log in to icsi and do everything locally
__label__False yeah
__label__False and i do nt want that to happen so we have to make it convenient for them to make change that they wan na make
__label__False that wa it
__label__False in the presentation
__label__False nah
__label__False it s pejorative to o ourselves right
__label__False yeah it s y you raised a point kind of uh euphemistically but i mean m maybe it is a serious problem ho what will they do when they go hear
__label__False it s like creating a m a map of a meeting in a sense
__label__False have you never read the peter s principle anyone here
__label__False yeah you can see the kind of kind of number that we re having say on speechdatcar which is a hard task cuz it s really um i think it s just sort of sort of reasonable number starting to be
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True but um yeah so next week i wo nt and the week after i wo nt cuz i ll be in finland
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False how far is it from here so
__label__False ok
__label__False doe the spectrum look like that or doe it look like that
__label__False ah
__label__False well th although
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False not here
__label__False i guess yep i guess that s it and uh th th that s where i am right now
__label__False good
__label__False transcript number one one three one dash one one five zero six five two nine seven eight eight nine
__label__False i i m confused you started off with twotwenty and you ended up with oneseventy
__label__False i do nt know the the specific of how they re doing it they re they re getting around the way the recognizer work because they re not allowed to um change the script for the recognizer
__label__False i mean so one option i
__label__False ok
__label__False but um
__label__False sixtyfour uh
__label__False right oh h that s
__label__False i mean just check it out check it out and do nt let anyone check it out
__label__False right
__label__False is it xml
__label__False so
__label__False and it might be different for government people
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False but if you were gon na put it in a a feature it mean you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net right
__label__False i have a co i have a copy that i l i downloaded so at one point it wa free
__label__False i mean i i never thought about it before but
__label__False ok how how big is it
__label__False yeah so i mean
__label__False no problem
__label__False i wa nt planning on doing it simultaneously
__label__False this
__label__False w wiener filtering because that is a m modified wiener filtering approach where instead of using the current frame it us adjacent frame also in designing the wiener filter
__label__False yeah
__label__False what
__label__False yep
__label__False i just uh it experience show you if if you do the
__label__False so it s three hundred in fortyfive minute but you have you have time uh uh marked twelve minute the the the um overlap in twelve minute of it got it
__label__False be of use to someone who s trying to do this right
__label__False right
__label__False to andreas the idea is is good s to eat here
__label__False so nobody would be there probably right
__label__False and then
__label__False well a bunch of difference and um actually the result that he he got were much better on tidigits especially
__label__False well we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization if we wan na go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone say a name
__label__False yeah i me and there s been this conversation going on about getting another file server and and we can do that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i see
__label__False um
__label__False and i can put that this is equal to the noise signal minus
__label__False that doe nt follow
__label__False hmm
__label__False what am i saying here yeah so that wa the sri system
__label__False the other hand they might just say they just do nt know enough yet to to declare a standard
__label__False ok
__label__True so in what javier did before when they were doing um h he wa looking for uh speaker change point
__label__False the question is is can we learn from that to change some of the other method we have since
__label__False oh thanks
__label__False it should be right around one if it s cuz it s a expansion of log one one minus epsilon or o is is one plus epsilon or is it one plus well there s an epsilon squared over two and an epsilon cubed over three and so forth so if epsilon is bigger than one then it diverges
__label__False right
__label__False i had two hour w with george on this so it um
__label__False and if you figure out well what s the there s a a least square algorithm that adjusts itself adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract essentially to subtract off uh different uh different reflection
__label__False so it s
__label__False there wa one on on out or out of
__label__False well i think yeah i think there are probably way that you can say that you know only certain user are allowed to change thing
__label__False well the music energy s very low apparently
__label__False sort of an equivalent
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but even i in
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i ca nt get back far enough
__label__False although he might cause problem but
__label__True that s not praat it s called trans transedit i think the the uh the tool from from susanne
__label__False well this table took uh more than five day to get back
__label__False three five three three four nine three nine zero three one five
__label__False so i think we do need to talk a little bit about
__label__False so so what is the lower curve and the upper curve
__label__False in and in fact that s what we do now cuz there s case even after jane listens where you know we have an expert ca nt even tell what they re talking about
__label__False you execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty step you know without any information other than new york huh inferring everything from the context so work
__label__True tell her your specific problem she ll fix
__label__False that s right and i also like i l also like liz s uh k um phraseology of at this level of i do nt remember how you put it but this at this level of transcription or whatever i mean it s like there are different layer of whatever and different type of convention and if it were an acronym then i would i think that it would make sense f for them to have input into that level of thing but i would nt want them to be changing
__label__False so
__label__False i do nt know but it seemed it did nt seem to be a problem at all i would imagine you add sixtyfour to a hundred and twenty eight
__label__False if you wan na play around with it in th in the future
__label__False oh yeah that sound good too
__label__False well no we did nt decide we wanted to look into maybe getting it the visualization a bit clearer but i think if we do it um sort of a paper version of all the node and then the connection between them that should suffice
__label__False johno
__label__False ok
__label__False well he wa the guy the guy that wa using
__label__False it seems to me that sending them email saying if you have an o ok reply to this email and say ok
__label__False um so i wanted to do this experiment to see um uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the backend recognizer for the aurora task and see how that affect thing
__label__False oh right so clean corresponds to high mismatch
__label__False that s my problem with this one the the ear thing come out to here it doe nt even fit over my ear
__label__False yeah
__label__False so do you have uh you you mean you have file which are hour of hour long or
__label__False that s great
__label__False but it doe seem like i i it doe seem like it s more logical to combine them first and then do the
__label__False that s what i
__label__False so why do nt you go ahead and start and i think it s just u down here at this end that have them so
__label__False and then on the terminal s side i do nt know how much um memory and and cpu it take but it seems like the filtering
__label__False it s just another
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False asp
__label__False oh well i have the picture
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh
__label__False scale
__label__False but eh the transcription eh for example i i do nt i i m not interested in the in the in the word transcription word eh transcribed eh eh in eh follow in the in the in the speech file but eh eh jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker in the in the meeting um eh she she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh there is an overlapping zone
__label__False it ha nothing to do with the meeting it s just the general icsi backup system is becoming saturated
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so these large section when you guy are nt talking
__label__False i do nt know how much of it s public
__label__False i t i think i ve tried a hundred and it wa more or le the same or slightly worse
__label__False the address would be fine
__label__False for which
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False the winner is bed mn timing now go there
__label__False hugin yeah that s free
__label__False hmm
__label__False but i m i it s not i mean they re sort of not in the same kind of category a say a phonetic target or a syllabic target or a or a feature or something
__label__False that s that s that s good
__label__False ok s
__label__False it s not so i do nt think it s um
__label__False the o the one that we have
__label__False twelve time nine input and a hundred uh hidden
__label__False and it actually mean that you should get the microphone a close together a possible
__label__False maximum incompetence and then you can throw them up the stair um
__label__False roughly
__label__False and some people do but
__label__False exactly drive through yeah
__label__False if and they re kind of correct and they kind of are are correct it s not just like anything
__label__False well we re getting some we we re getting some right now
__label__False using the the gaussian yeah
__label__False well m my feeling about that is p is p
__label__False yeah
__label__False well the parser and that stuff
__label__False we d have to get a almost certainly have to get a uh netfinity server
__label__False i m just glad that i do nt have to work it out because
__label__False is it written on her sheet i believe
__label__False right
__label__False uh we did nt we did nt have enough electron here and
__label__False i think it ha to exist somewhere
__label__False it ha wonderful wall
__label__False whether the destination wa their final destination whether the destination wa closed those are all
__label__False but it would worry me to have people um having free reign to change these thing because of the need to have consistent convention and people who are only just visiting the data might not have a sense of the larger system
__label__False um
__label__False two four four nine three seven nine two one
__label__False well
__label__False yeah another thing to do um is also to um i guess to ask around people about other bayesnet package
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah you could still eh
__label__False yeah
__label__False he ll say
__label__False hmm
__label__False and
__label__False mmm
__label__False so i i m eight you re seven
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False well that ll be good
__label__False well do we have that much let s see we have
__label__False no the edge
__label__False so we were nt concerned with exactly when an overlap started and stopped
__label__False i mean basically it s it s all the difference in the world i mean basically he s he s on it now
__label__False above um it seems that
__label__False yeah
__label__False no
__label__False ok
__label__False so
__label__False yeah and if it change to point five point five which is equal for transition and self loop where it becomes eightyeight percent
__label__False i m a may birthday yeah so i have to
__label__False but uh having having somebody have some experience again with with uh with marking it from a human standpoint we re i mean i do nt expect jose to to do it for uh f fifty hour of of speech but i mean we if uh if he could speed up what he wa doing by just getting the speaker overlap so that we had it say for fortyfive minute then at least we d have three hundred example of it and when when uh adam wa doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it wa different
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s
__label__False yeah i know that th the telecom people use use spurt for that yes
__label__False so we do nt waste a lot of tape
__label__False yeah
__label__False eight two seven two one six four three six
__label__False um yeah
__label__False right so it ll just display ok so we do nt have to worry about um
__label__False and comparing different bad result can be tricky
__label__False um um
__label__False and how do we find the transcript for those so that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but but but what i m what i m saying is
__label__False and then there would nt be this extra load
__label__False and so uh those might be harder to track down
__label__False but uh a completely different tack on it wou is the one that wa suggested uh by your colleague in spain which is to say do nt worry so much about the uh feature
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False actually let me hold that thought let me back up while we re still on it the the other thing i wa suggesting though is that given that you re talking about binary feature uh maybe the first thing to do is just to count and uh count cooccurrences and get probability for a discrete hmm cuz that d be pretty simple because it s just say if you had ten ten event uh that you were counting uh each frame would only have a thousand possible value for these ten bit and uh so you could make a table that would say if you had thirtynine phone category that would be a thousand by thirtynine and just count the cooccurrences and divide them by the the uh uh uh occ uh count the cooccurrences between the event and the phone and divide them by the number of occurrence of the phone and that would give you the likelihood of the of the event given the phone and um then just use that in a very simple hmm and uh you could uh do phone recognition then and uh would nt have any of the issue of the uh training of the net or i mean it d be on the simple side but uh um
__label__True what what is vt again
__label__False you wan na read
__label__False that is
__label__False forty nine seventy seven one six zero three five zero
__label__False you know it it go back to nearestneighbor sort of thing right um i i if is it eh w
__label__False and at least supposedly the way they work is by feeding them what is the output of the recognizer
__label__False so th the system actually extract the speaker id from the waveform name
__label__False and um in this case we would probably all agree that he want to go there our beliefnet think he want to go there right in the uh whatever if we have something like this here and
__label__False yeah exactly
__label__False i mean
__label__False well the expression that appear in the in the paper is uh
__label__False alright
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False what our decision wa is that we ll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlap
__label__False yeah and there is there is also this log energy versus czero
__label__False and that actually helped uh uh a little bit
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh
__label__False alright
__label__False no it s no it s even simpler thing than that is just that you do nt know
__label__False and from the other side it s fortyfive so it s you have seventythree feature and you re just feeding them like that
__label__False well
__label__True but that s yeah that s an interesting thing to try to see if what s going on is that in the highly mismatched condition it s um causing deletion by having this silence probability up up too high
__label__False i ca nt i m having competing microphone headphone problem here
__label__False yeah w it doe nt really have much meaning to grad student but final project might
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and there s much more of them yeah they re
__label__False seven seven five zero eight three nine five four seven
__label__False yeah
__label__False and and then when the the the proposal actually came in and half of them had vads and half of them did nt and the half that did did well and the half that did nt did poorly so it s
__label__False and the clean speech the statistic of the clean speech is from a codebook
__label__False and then um adam did something where um we converted these feature file into wave file so you can display them
__label__False this is the bakery example got it alright
__label__False right
__label__False same thing
__label__False yeah
__label__False seven four one zero five five nine eight two
__label__True when are they planning
__label__False if you have n feature then it s two to the n or exponential in n
__label__False mmhmm mouth stuff
__label__False we can say um
__label__False and we do our own backup once and for all all and then and we do nt have to bother this up
__label__False but why why why only those three why not the whol
__label__False we could nt we could nt figure out how to turn it off of tango
__label__False oh ok
__label__False ah that s right that wa it so
__label__False we can talk about path being the fastest the quickest the nicest and so forth uh or or and the trajector should be coming in there a well
__label__False instead of the wave file
__label__False no
__label__False oh yeah digit
__label__False yeah because eh i leave eh the next sunday i will come back to home to spain
__label__False that i think went away a couple of version ago but it s good to know
__label__False transcript one two three one dash one two five zero
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False um anyway it s just a thought
__label__False but
__label__False well i put before this name uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False good
__label__False i mean the mlp s not trained on finnish
__label__False or not public and not a door are equivalent thing it seems like in practice
__label__False yeah i d so i i jus
__label__False or the crosstalk
__label__False mmm
__label__False oh it
__label__False or a beep and the number
__label__False well
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True the twentyninth
__label__False y actually uh um for the danish there s still some kind of mystery because um um when we use the straight feature we are not able to get these nice number with the icsi ogi one i mean
__label__False what s are the freq
__label__False well we can p if it s if we can pay yeah if you know it s paying a thousand dollar or something we can do that
__label__False now this this this uh
__label__False um so
__label__False i m
__label__False ok but you re actually saying that certain uh speaker were mi misidentified
__label__False way
__label__False then i can be out of here quickly
__label__False so it improves compared to the baseline
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh that s still noisy
__label__False i
__label__False cuz it s just hard to do
__label__False yeah it s it s interesting i mean basically we re dealing with rever reverberation and um when we deal with pure reverberation the technique he s using work really really well
__label__True let s let s i mean i think that a a we said before that one of the thing that we re imagining is that uh there there will be uh in the system we end up with there ll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise in addition to the uh other thing that we re talking about and that s probably the best thing to do and there wa that one email that said that it sounded like uh uh thing looked very promising up there in term of uh i think they were using ericsson s approach or something and in addition to
__label__False i guess they have nt got a p
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False f i think yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False and which is a s a s a simpler problem perhaps but which is perhaps important for noisy speech
__label__False hmm
__label__False still i mean it should nt confuse the
__label__False so theoretically you could edit that
__label__False well i
__label__False well but all we ll get
__label__False w we just we save
__label__False i do nt think people were very critical because it wa interesting just to to try this and you know it wa the first time they tried it so so the you know the number were not incredibly good but there s you know it wa th reasonable
__label__False do they mean omnidirectional is that their point i mean all the noise cancelling mike they re you know they re a few m millimeter away from each other pointing in different direction
__label__False ye no but i but if you if you if you work in th in that xml community it is a great acronym because it e evokes whatever rdf rdf is the biggest thing right that s the rich sort of resource description framework and um and also so description having the word d term description in there is wonderful uh rich is also great rwww
__label__False and i did some presegmentations for for jane and i m not sure how good they are or what what the transcriber say they they can use it or
__label__False why
__label__False could nt format them no
__label__False and the b the thing that make it ea ok to do that is knowing where the synch time boundary are
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True yes um i talked with uh munich guy from from ludwi ludwig maximilians university who do a lot of transcribing and transliteration
__label__False mmm
__label__False a of february
__label__False yeah
__label__False so it s yeah so it s actually forty number that you re getting
__label__False yes
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False then you d put a little tick at the beginning of the word and that just signal that um this is not standard and then in curly bracket pron error
__label__False in the hl t paper we took segment that are channel timealigned which is now h being changed in the transcription process which is good and we took case where the transcriber said there wa only one person talking here because no one else had time any word in that segment and called that nonoverlap
__label__False and then then there wa some p some modification of the cepstral parameter where they
__label__False but that can include tap
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well
__label__False so when you were saying we need to do a rerun of like
__label__False hmm
__label__False o one three five six five five zero four three one zero one seven five six two nine four nine five seven eight three nine nine o four six seven
__label__False that w oh yeah they they might
__label__False yeah
__label__False but i th i gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruption with something else like some other noise
__label__False mmm
__label__False you know for whatever it s gon na be uh
__label__False for every question like
__label__False well the inference structure wa lokendra
__label__False yeah there were diff there were different thing and basically the first thing is the mmm alpha uh value so the recursion uh part um
__label__False right
__label__False wonderful
__label__False it s a very big one i do nt remember m
__label__False mmm
__label__False but one of the reason i have chuck s messing around with with the backend that you re not supposed to touch
__label__False yep it s sort of one of those that s it s more like a decision tree if if you want
__label__False ok
__label__False now how would you interpret that without a lot of inference so the inference that are involved are thing like ok so how do you interpret ahead of the game
__label__False and so there may be
__label__False oh yeah yeah oh i know
__label__False yeah i noticed that um that some of the example they had had you know nonenglish word order and so on you know and then all that good stuff so like
__label__False about other experiment
__label__True yeah did nt he say his signalprocessing class wa like
__label__False yeah
__label__False so do you are you w did you have something going on on the side with uh multiband or on on this or
__label__False yeah i ll get it
__label__False uh so it s noisy timit that s right yeah
__label__False on the the the accuracy w went from it wa something vaguely like ninetyfive point six accuracy um improved to ninetyfive point nine wh when i
__label__False that s the way the the the frame are packed like you have to wait for one more frame to pack because it s the crc is computed for two frame always
__label__False i doubt it would help by forty per cent
__label__False ok
__label__False so three three hundred and fifty input uh six thousand hidden node and two output t t
__label__False alright
__label__False yeah if well
__label__False what d what do they need to do left
__label__False sure
__label__False nope
__label__False oh ok
__label__False right
__label__False yeah slikes and send mail u s o o
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah well if we do nt have an anything else to discus we should uh turn off the machine and then say the real nasty thing
__label__False so what i did is i just took the file with those in it converted it so that it look like an audio file
__label__False i i m not sure
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so not try to combine them
__label__False ok so the s the the next thing we had on the agenda wa something about alignment
__label__False right so
__label__False yeah
__label__False document
__label__False two two five eight
__label__False i ve been just writing my uh formal thesis proposal
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean yeah i can like i c um this week i guess um kind of i have a lot of project and stuff but after that i will generally be more free so yes i might
__label__False i see
__label__False the r uh the in term of why is it s laid out like this versus some other um that s kind of a contentious point between the two of u but this is one wa so this is a way to link uh the way these role are filled out to the action
__label__False in fact that s what we do
__label__False ye yeah but here it s something different we want to have feature uh well um
__label__False let s just say make it really simple if we create something that for example would be um
__label__False yeah
__label__False but yo i guess you d still get the mistake that you mentioned because the person i mean if that s some of the error those would probably stay the same regardless
__label__False but this this is correct and now i can do it uh pfff
__label__False so right so i
__label__False is that right
__label__False the only argument for doing so would be with reference to the content content map
__label__False it s baumwelch training
__label__False not by every speaker but by some speaker there s a lot of word
__label__False seven one five one six zero seven two five nine four two
__label__False yeah actually that s true
__label__False oh yeah sorry
__label__False ok
__label__False doe nt have to go down
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False um now what s the noise condition um of the training data
__label__False but it s some other data we have and if somebody doing experiment want to train up including that then they can right
__label__False but uh the burned one i mean when i say two or three year what i m saying is that
__label__False that wa like our example
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False ohhuh
__label__False um he had the france telecom blind equalization in the system
__label__False so naming convention and thing like that that i ve been trying to keep actually up to date
__label__False i mean part of why i i think part of why you were getting into the klt y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if uh you know getting good orthogonal feature wa and combining the the different temporal range wa the key thing that wa happening or whether it wa this discriminant thing right so you were just trying
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False how standard are these
__label__False sure ok
__label__False based on the k what the question wa so what the discourse the ontology the situation and the user model gave u we came up with these value for these decision
__label__False uh if we have clean speech we have the dictionary for the clean speech we have a probability f of our our weight for each gaussian
__label__False yeah just it just seems like this kind of behavior could be caused by you know s some of the training data being messed up
__label__False one nine zero zero two seven eight three
__label__False i think eight meeting or something which which i m using and it s before it wa twenty minute of one meeting so should be a little bit better
__label__False or i jus
__label__False three wireds work right
__label__False so i i had
__label__False and with the number there it s much le likely
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False now do we know either from their experience or from yours that uh just having uh two parameter the the mean and variance is enough
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh so
__label__False o zero one two o four two five five six six six seven eight two eight nine
__label__False you d have fainter would nt you get fainter reception out here
__label__False something that we have nt really settled on yet is other than this aurora stuff uh what do we do large vocabulary training slash testing for uh tandem system
__label__False so i mean the other thing is that uh
__label__False ok
__label__False and you can parallelize the training
__label__False there s a special aurora session and the aurora pe people involved in aurora have till ma uh early may or something to turn in their paper
__label__False transcript l s dash two hundred seven two two nine eight one two six four five four one five six three two two one one six three five six seven six five four one four four three two three one zero nine four seven five eight one nine one one one three one zero three two seven five zero three six nine one three three seven five one one five zero four two eight nine zero eight seven zero seven six
__label__False interesting
__label__False and then um there s also the question whether it may be entered
__label__False oh this wa from before december yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False seems like there d be a ok
__label__False so
__label__False right
__label__False by s saving sixteen bit on instead of thirty instead of thirtytwo
__label__False hmm
__label__False and also i mean this is a what the input is going to be right
__label__False some of it s masking masked
__label__True and um then should we start on thursday
__label__True i will promise for the next time to have fleshed out n xml example for a a run through and and see how this this then translates and how this can come about nuh including the sort of miracle occurs here um part
__label__False that s somewhere
__label__False ok
__label__False unless you did like a second pas over it or something after you ve got your
__label__False uh and i wa going to switch to start talking about that unless there re m other more general question
__label__False you mean the s
__label__False o zero one two o six two three
__label__False so are we the only one who are giving demo or is uh
__label__False doe nt matter
__label__False so i think that s that s pretty good
__label__False plus it s hip the kid ll like it
__label__False yeah it s way better
__label__False yep
__label__False yep
__label__False oh
__label__False so now if you um try to r you
__label__False but i do nt know if people have done sort of careful comparison of this on large task or anything
__label__False this is f
__label__False the the the
__label__False um and the other thing this would kind of be a hail mary but but uh
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False well see i know s sue wrote about spurt of development but in any case i think it s a good term and uh
__label__False we had originally hoped we were getting eight hundred megahertz processor they ended up being five fifty
__label__False yeah we have a lot of those
__label__False and all the possible output too
__label__False you know so
__label__False um and then we would do an unsupervised clustering of of the segment to and and put the similar one into bin that would be sort of pseudospeakers and then we would do our standard processing on these pseudospeakers
__label__False i had the impression
__label__False so for those kind of reason and also a a c a complete inversion if you actually i mentioned that it s kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustic
__label__False i do nt know a cabinet is probably going to cost a hundred dollar two hundred dollar something like that
__label__False one six zero six five zero five seven one
__label__False right
__label__False and undoubtably there s been ream of work about it in cognitive linguistics but
__label__False yeah
__label__False no for yes f
__label__False um
__label__False ok
__label__False i know you d prefer it but the proble we have there s a problem with it
__label__False you you can use whatever procedure you want that s p convenient for you all i m saying is that there s no way that we re gon na tell people that reading digit is meeting
__label__False yeah they re they re doing uh neural net just just training up a whole bunch of neural net and
__label__False so what are these number here are these with the clean or with the noisy
__label__False i ca nt show that
__label__False sure
__label__False ok thanks
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok here we go
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False yes exactly that ha nt changed so it i the it s basically a twotiered structure where the first one is whether the person who s interrupted continues or not and then below that there re subcategories uh that have more to do with you know is it uh simply backchannel or is it um someone completing someone else s thought or is it someone in introducing a new thought
__label__False no the multilingual database are two time the broad english data
__label__False and uh i did nt h i mean i i found that the result i mean i wa nt getting that r result on the tidigit so i wa like looking into why what is wrong with the tidigits why why i wa not getting it and i found that the noise estimation is a reason for the tidigits to perform worse than the baseline
__label__False i did nt know he wa the founder that s
__label__False um and then it s a pretty small neural network which use um nine frame of of six feature from czero to cfives plus the first derivative
__label__False i mean it s just an interesting problem
__label__True great oh the other thing we wan na do is catch up with uh ellen and see what she s doing because the um image schema are going to be um an important pa we we want those right and we want them formalized and stuff like that
__label__False ok
__label__False i m gone for two and a half week starting starting next wed late next wednesday
__label__False um so i it would be a a measure of
__label__False yeah
__label__False take the one where we have a clear winner
__label__False so uh i m interested in hearing hearing your thought about where you think we should go from this
__label__False wh what cause the crash
__label__False and then maybe it would just learn learn it better
__label__False yeah they can be very different yeah mmhmm
__label__False i mean i p i personally really prefer that model so i think you know we ve got this problem of people having different different preference
__label__False oh
__label__True i can be around and g i mean generally if you email me also i can be around on other day
__label__False it s an interesting idea
__label__False right yeah that one s right
__label__False no no
__label__False transcript three two one one dash three two three zero six zero eight one one nine five
__label__False so these are the result of ogi with online normalization and straight feature to htk
__label__False so very specific role name are viewed thing entered thing
__label__False oh the ok uh maybe i d
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh
__label__False you know
__label__False ah
__label__False we ll take the opportunity and get another big raft of of disk i guess
__label__False they are a little bit better yeah but
__label__False nine three one nine eight six five eight
__label__False whoever will pay yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False um just extract the segment and do a forced alignment and if the score is good then you say it match
__label__False mmm
__label__False i guess those are the main two thing it doe learning it ha
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False could i
__label__False would they both be listed here in ok under so o under action schema there s a list that can include both both thing
__label__False you ca nt just fold it in a if it s i mean digit are different too right
__label__False point s
__label__False so the i think the in some sense we we ex get the task done extremely well because this is exactly the discussion we need need period no more qualifier than that so and um and and i th i hope um uh let s make a a a a sharper claim we will not end this discussion anytime soon
__label__False and so then we switched to new boot alignment which which now had the benefit of all these improvement that we ve made over two year in the system
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False ok yeah i mean
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False did you notice i put in the filter
__label__False ok so i ll go ahead and start with digit
__label__False it s low it s very low you would comp if we compare it with eh the headphone and
__label__False yeah um
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah they re they re are a couple of more thing i mean
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False right one for each participant
__label__False the variance yeah reduces so
__label__False and uh i did nt analyze further yet but i think it s it may be due to the fricative sound which may be in noisy condition maybe label labeled a silence
__label__True and we present our result our final definite
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False should talk to him about that
__label__False yeah with the clean lda
__label__False ok this is dan on the uh wired headset transcript number one two one four eight three eight eight four three o six five seven one five five two seven six seven eight
__label__False yeah
__label__False and
__label__False ok another successful babble
__label__False because um the the latency of the vad is two hundred and twenty millisecond
__label__False and it and it and it ha significant effect down there that wa sort of the idea
__label__False so it s just an adhoc i mean some intermediate result because it s not optimized for anything
__label__False it wa a very early one i do nt know if it s the first one
__label__False i wa estimating it should be and i m not sure why
__label__False and then i sort of sort of bask in in your glory
__label__False s p model which is what they put in between digit i i have nt calculated that for that one yet but um
__label__False the three language is not digit it s the broad data ok
__label__False it s no the third part so it s uh highly mismatched
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and the same is true for the proposal
__label__False and then uh just to remind me all of that go into uh that all of that is transformed by uh uh k kl or something or
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well it it s like the high mismatch of the speechdatcar after cleaning up maybe having more noise than the the training set of timit after clean s after you do the noise cleanup
__label__False and
__label__False i think that s counter to that idea now again it s we re just trying these different thing we do nt really know what s gon na work best but if that s the hypothesis at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that
__label__False ok make sense yeah
__label__False that s a pretty good point right there yeah
__label__False whatever
__label__False canned
__label__False yeah
__label__False so basically you d have a decision tree query gothere
__label__False but uh one of the reason i have him messing around with that because i think it s sort of an open question that we do nt know the answer to people always say very glibly that i if you s show improvement on a bad system that doe nt mean anything cuz it may not be show uh because you know it doe nt tell you anything about the good system
__label__False but how doe the expert but how doe the expert system know how who which one to declare the winner if it doe nt know the question it is and how that question should be answered
__label__False yeah well that s
__label__False htk we use for um this aurora stuff
__label__False i have not the slightest idea
__label__False so in that case it might not make much difference at all
__label__True did he ever figure out how to d switch between application like he wa wanting to do
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False well i i do nt know i mean you could you could do a paper on what s wrong with the aurora task by comparing it to other way of doing it
__label__False uh octave yeah it s it s it s free i think we have it here r running somewhere
__label__False exactly schema uh that of that type
__label__False i i con i consider
__label__False w yeah i mean
__label__False but if you go to very very fine category it s very binary
__label__False because maybe they re the threshold that they are using on the basis of this value i do nt know exactly because well th i thought maybe they have a meaning but i do nt know what is the meaning of take exactly this value
__label__False uh um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i agr i agree but i have to also add one other thing which i before i forget it which is
__label__False uh so the delay is only the forty millisecond of the noise cleaning plus the hundred millisecond smoothing at the output
__label__False we said four gigabyte would give u twenty minute before we did anything else
__label__False you interrupt somebody but then there s no line after that for example there s no speaker identification after that line
__label__False oh you do nt know ok
__label__False i would think
__label__False so the real case
__label__False well no we can store them here
__label__False well i only say that the this is a summary of the of all the vt experiment and say that the result in the last um for italian the last experiment for italian are bad
__label__False and then also the position of the mike also if it s more directly you ll get better volume
__label__False and it wa a problem uh with the scale
__label__False and so you s it show that instead of the wavefile
__label__False oh yeah i think i see
__label__False no this in the it s this is the log domain i i must to say that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah although the the using the closetalking i think would be much better would nt it
__label__False but eh there is nt any any mark time temporal mark to to c eh to mmm eheh to label the beginning and the end of the of the ta
__label__False we can just run it assuming that it s all one speaker basically and see what happens
__label__False so it i mean it s pretty good the way that they have it set up but um i
__label__False yep
__label__False it must be somewhere
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False american english speaker you know that i did nt mean to say microfon
__label__False oh ok of course mmhmm
__label__False so try to um um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation
__label__False um well yeah i guess not that much though only a little early
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i just
__label__False um
__label__False so that in effect what i could do is use our code but produce mel cepstrum and compare that directly to
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False see cuz i i there could be lot of thing right but but but but um let s suppose just for a second that uh we ve sort of taken out a lot of the the major difference uh between the two i mean we re already sort of using the mel scale and we re using the same style filter integration and and well we re making sure that low and high
__label__False um
__label__False ok
__label__False liz and andreas actually they re not here but they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False but of course sometimes it doe nt uh port so i think that s that s an interesting question if we re getting three percent error on uh u uh english uh nati native speaker um using the aurora system and we do some improvement and bring it from three to two do those same improvement bring uh th you know the sri system from one point three to you know to point eight well you know so that s that s something we can test
__label__False yeah
__label__False go and right query
__label__False what
__label__False yeah
__label__False um are you familiar with with the with the very rough setup of the data experiment
__label__False i think
__label__False twelve minute
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh i thought you were finishing your thesis in two week
__label__False so uh what we re gon na do initially is is do design and i if you will guess
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False but maybe w we should just reverse this to make it a little bit more delicate
__label__False uh you know it doe nt seem like a bad idea to have that information
__label__False but ch ten solid uh m ch s chunk of ten solid minute where they both coded the same data and um
__label__False uh i mean i think that s actually really u useful also because even if you were nt studying overlap if you wan na get a transcription for the farfield mike how are you gon na know which word from which speaker occurred at which time relative to each other you have to be able to get a transcript like like this anyway just for doing farfield recognition so you know it s it s sort of
__label__False and we have all the top one all the one to which no arrow are pointing
__label__False so if you are a d
__label__False and if we do nt let them modify their own data they re not gon na store their data in our repository
__label__False so they know that the weighting is good for the well matched and so there s everywhere the well matched s s s performance is very good for the french telecom
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False maybe i i ve heard this at icslp for year and year and year though
__label__False and and just um store it there i mean
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think it is a s
__label__False yeah
__label__False well uh yes but what i mean is that uh from the transcriber s perspective uh those two function are separate and dan elli s hack handle the um choice the ability to choose different waveform from moment to moment
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well i think there re lot of lot of way of doing it
__label__False yeah you have some result that are good for the high mismatch
__label__False yeah i g i guess um the reason i did it this way is that in february it we we tested different thing like that so having two klt having just a klt for a network or having a global klt
__label__False well w ok so in that situation though th maybe what s a little different there is i think you re talking about there s only one it it it also depends we re getting a little off track here r but but but
__label__False i mean again the cambridge folk found the plp actually to be a little better
__label__False yeah i have the mean
__label__False once we have the expanded version so if we have a ton of scratch disk maybe the thing to do is leave those up and then use
__label__False it s the person s fault it s morgan s fault
__label__False major
__label__False never cha this is one of the approximation that i am doing
__label__False yeah
__label__False the acoustic the acoustic on this are really s m better than when i talk into it directly
__label__True and y uh email any time but most usefully before
__label__False two four two one eight seven two zero eight three
__label__False mmm channel five
__label__False i i do i do nt remember who he is
__label__False yeah
__label__False well maybe it would be a good idea for one of u to like on wednesday or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda item
__label__False a long a that s o k i mean i might slip out and say it accidentally that s all i m saying
__label__False do you see because
__label__False so um um i m i m going to convert that via a filter into these tagged uh subcategorized comment and same thing with you know we see you get a subset when you do what you re saying you end up with a s with uh you re collapsing across a frequency you just have the token and you can um have a filter which more efficiently make those change but the number and acronym have to be handled by hand because you know i mean jus
__label__False four one three six two five six six nine zero
__label__False oh i on i did ten but i can i have a script to generate them automatically
__label__False it might actually help them in term of their place holding yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False but
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__True so some of the the top row of thing what s what s disc admission fee
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False so we talked on the phone about this that that there wa still a difference of a of a few percent and you told me that there wa a difference in how the normalization wa done
__label__False cuz i uh the way you describe what they meant they were nt mutu uh they did nt seem mutually exclusive to me
__label__False and and that s that s uh how much of that is digit
__label__False one that are nt on people s desk
__label__False three nine three zero nine five seven nine eight
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah but it s still true that what you re doing is you re ignoring you re you re coming up with something to represent whether it s a distribution probability distribution or feature you re coming up with a set of variable that are representing uh thing that vary w over context
__label__False five six four two five three four seven six two
__label__False we oh
__label__False but of course they do nt know that it s the same person both time
__label__False it is yep
__label__False but anyway th so there are there are case like that um
__label__False yeah
__label__False well most of the way uh
__label__False i think i need a copy of this yes i is there an extra copy around
__label__False depends
__label__False to go on forever
__label__False yeah
__label__False um yeah i did that but it doe nt matter on speechdatcar but it matter uh a lot on tidigits
__label__False but here s the the amazing result um they say
__label__False it s gon na you know the exact interaction of the microphone s gon na differ depending on the person and so forth but at least the basic acoustic are gon na be the same
__label__False yeah uh so not not right now maybe
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i have nt done it
__label__False they ve got headphone and then i guess they have a computer and they have a foot pedal which let them quickly scan back and forth through the tape i i t i s make the tape go real fast forward or fast backward
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it seems like she if she s g if she s moving time mark around since our representation in transcriber us time mark it seems like there should be some way of of using that benefitting from that
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False uh
__label__False and then given that uh liz and andreas are gon na be ten fifteen minute late we can try to figure out what we can do most effectively without them here so
__label__False yeah
__label__False second thing is never mind the different language just having acoustic condition rather than training them all up in one would it be helpful to have different one
__label__False only
__label__False yeah that ll work
__label__False i i tho it s probably better if i come next week with the um version o point nine of the structure
__label__False oh neat
__label__False that d be good
__label__False um so uh
__label__False so i started going through and looking
__label__False around five percent better i guess if if i
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh we should do it
__label__False we
__label__False we can expre we can put that the
__label__False mmm
__label__False always fun
__label__False no net
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah but ther more obvious is that yeah the the more obvious is that that well using the th the fft um you just it give you just information about if it s voiced or not voiced ma mainly i mean but so
__label__False sorry
__label__False and then we can give those to ibm and it ll make it easier for them to put them on tape
__label__False pierced tongue or
__label__False eight five seven eight seven nine zero nine
__label__False where is a nightclub
__label__False right
__label__False these three he want to know something about it he want to know where it is he want to go there
__label__False feature ma make up some feature for those
__label__False so it s a great idea and if it were true than i would just do that but it s not that bad like the room is not the bottleneck and we have enough time in the room it s getting the people to come in and put on the and get the setup going
__label__False you know jane
__label__False yeah keep thing from getting out of sequence if they heard it over again they would know it would be obvious from their transcript whether they did that one or not
__label__False that s a good idea
__label__False so i mean you re you re you re trying to be clever and say what s the statistic that should we should get about this difference but uh in fact you know maybe just feeding this in or or feeding both of them in you know another way saying let it figure out what s the what is the interaction especially if you do this over multiple frame
__label__True and they have these table with uh various language model weight insertion penalty u
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i
__label__False um right now it s still kind of in a toy version of it because we did nt know the probability of or
__label__False we should be able to right
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False are are people going to be allowed to bleep out section of a meeting where they were nt speaking
__label__False y you know he started his own company based on tcl stuff and maybe they have the native code compiler or something
__label__False i i uh i appreciate the discussion
__label__False for all the language ok
__label__False yes
__label__False sr i system look like it work is that it read the wavefiles directly uh and doe all of the cepstral computation stuff on the fly
__label__False well that s the
__label__False w well we have for example a canonical use of something and y it s you know we have some construction and then it s construed a something and then we we may get the same construction with a metaphorical use that s also relevant to the to the domain
__label__False the thing is it s really not very expensive right now
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False i see
__label__False and so in the final one here you end up with uh for all of the the digit word you end up with uh three mixture per state eh in the final thing
__label__False uh
__label__True the the meeting is july sixteenth through eighteenth
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False you know i did i did uh something almost identical to this at one of my previous job and it work pretty well i mean i almost exactly what you described an energy detector with a median filter you look for run
__label__False the twentyfirst
__label__False six two three one zero five nine zero seven
__label__False ok
__label__False and if w if it know more than we would really give it when it run we call it cheating but it s
__label__False oh am spartacus verstehe ok
__label__False well there s there s uh been a lot of behavioral thing o on this but that wa the first neur neurophysiological thing i saw
__label__False ok great thanks very much
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oops i m sorry
__label__False however you know if i i understand your point that it th it ha a long tradition in this field i did nt realize and is used this is interesting what what adam said about it being used also for a bunch of other uh dimension
__label__False also it seems like once it s been stored that night it s it s possible to recover from backup so that the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it wa recorded
__label__False yep
__label__False obscure yeah
__label__False going seventy sixty fifty forty mile an hour on what kind of road with what passing you with uh i mean
__label__False theoretically you could affect doing business with ha door
__label__False yeah i i ll
__label__False i just randomly label thing
__label__False because i i suppose you could make some that have sort of that you have to orient towards your mouth and then it would
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False do you
__label__False i dunno
__label__False yeah it might be that lda could be better
__label__False yeah maybe maybe you do nt have a
__label__False it s true
__label__False i i it s it s eh it s a f training set that s about um you know by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system so some of these smoothing issue are overfitting for that matter and the baumwelch should be much le of a factor if you go full whole hog and so w so just um so the strategy is to first sort of treat thing with fast turnaround on a smaller training set and then when you ve sort of narrowed it down you try it on a larger training set and so we have nt done that yet
__label__False old one
__label__False i m just glad that do nt have to work it out myself that i m not involved at all in the working out of it because
__label__False it s not the digit so it s the combination of two thing there
__label__False no you do nt have training on english testing
__label__False i mean it s it s pretty pretty common people say this
__label__False uh i ll i ll d i ll double check that and ask him again
__label__False the dif no unvoiced i do nt have for unvoiced i m sorry
__label__False that s important yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah we in fact that s yeah maybe we
__label__False so
__label__False i have no idea because the issue i brought up wa with a very simple spectral subtraction approach and the one that they use at ogi is one from from the proposed the the the aurora prop uh proposal which might be much better
__label__False so sh you guy should pick something and
__label__False really
__label__False are there is there are there any ht k training testing going on
__label__False anything else
__label__False and then finish it up doe that so make sense
__label__False so this might just be a temporary thing but
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False n
__label__False so that mean other people are editing what you say
__label__False good
__label__False but but no well no well no i mean it is nt the operating theater i mean they don they they do nt they do nt really know i think
__label__False right
__label__False ok so one question this wa in this case it s all um clear sort of obvious but you can think of the enter view and approach a each having their role right the
__label__False well yeah we can
__label__False that s un
__label__False this this friday
__label__False right you can also
__label__False let s read some digit
__label__False and there are a lot of i think but i have to study with more detail
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok yeah i guess i sent it around a little bit but
__label__False then we compute the difference yeah uhhuh
__label__False the copy are ready
__label__False you could
__label__False yeah
__label__False and so this this wa how do you map all that information onto that a onto the meeting domain
__label__False what about using it in the neural net
__label__False yeah aikin alex yeah
__label__False uh they did nt decide yet i guess i this wa one point of the conference call also but mmm so i do nt know um but yeah
__label__False anyway
__label__False and the the model of clean speech is a codebook right
__label__False we
__label__False the other thing too is th y you said that the acoustic pra q quality of the one that you re wearing the fancy one is actually somewhat better than
__label__False oh um well only one i am only using only one i do nt know i
__label__False eight zero three two three seven seven six zero one
__label__False ok
__label__False and increase
__label__False hmm
__label__False imagine that we reverse this and they were keeping the repository and we were d collecting meeting and sending them to them
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False hunh
__label__False right
__label__False mmm
__label__False but it give u a nice handle so with this we can basically um you know s slaughter the cow any anyway we want
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so um
__label__False we
__label__False um no no no it s not completely no it s i am doing something like an adaptation of the noise
__label__False good
__label__False right so you could start pulling back but
__label__False ok ok so let me go back to what you had though um
__label__False yep
__label__False to give it to them i mean like like morgan wa saying they they
__label__False so i m speaking on the ear mounted uh wired headset thing
__label__False so
__label__False it
__label__False you know like do you say alright i m going to uh do an spg action
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False shall we do digit
__label__False oh
__label__False pasta
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False well the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these number without the adaptation
__label__False um
__label__False so i think maybe what s causing it to crash is i keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it s working and so i think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again cause it to crash
__label__False ok
__label__False and threepoint relation is if something ha an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f shoe is behind the chair
__label__False yeah
__label__False p s this
__label__False yeah but mmm
__label__False yep i think that s probably true
__label__False hmm interesting
__label__False right
__label__False cuz you could send it through email you re thinking
__label__False just se set a few of them you do nt have to do the whole thing that we did last time just like uh maybe the fact that they use a certain verb actually forget the verb just uh
__label__True and i talked to liz about this and it look a if friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data
__label__False no and now this weight is different now because it s conditional and this i need to to calcu i know this and i know this because this is from the dictionary that you have
__label__False and it seems to me that um if that is an important idea which you know might be that one could work at it for a while a you re saying
__label__False is the t is egual is equal to uh log of
__label__False yeah
__label__False well look at look
__label__False can we just have a directory called like other stuff
__label__False and apparently uh some people are pushing to still keep this fifty percent number so they want to have at least fifty percent improvement on the baseline but w which would be a much better baseline
__label__False mmm
__label__False so
__label__False but uh it seems like we could have i mea or uh we could put all of the all of the r information that could also be relevant into the whereis node answer
__label__False ok
__label__False great
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False if if uh uh y you re right i mean each of these require this
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s another issue but
__label__False um i do nt think so
__label__False and it took you a few hour to to do it
__label__False o o one one eight two four nine two three five seven eight zero four five zero two five six eight six seven nine one four
__label__False here s a k
__label__False yeah did i just
__label__False you ca nt directly compare them because for every set of model you compute a new normalization
__label__False no i i my result is with the noisy noisy lda
__label__False which nsa meeting wa that
__label__False yeah
__label__False so i do nt understand
__label__False so i think that s a good idea
__label__False so it s it s
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False maybe
__label__False yeah and then um
__label__False tried that and it died
__label__False so we e w f w
__label__False and the other person n unkn n quite unknowingly wa changing it the other way around
__label__False uh now i lost track of what i wa thinking but
__label__False no fortyfive minute is the is the session all the session
__label__False but a nancy just su suggested it s probably ellipticus huh
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False chocolate adaptation
__label__False we that s alright i can probably double cli click on it
__label__False no actually um
__label__False we just wanted to keep this w well not too huge so
__label__False so to to uh actually um uh specify the the task
__label__False ok then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of word the uh tag for like where where sentence end of sentence question mark um various other thing uh
__label__False actually we re experimenting with phase stuff now and and uh thi this uh first result he got uh wa really great it actually uh uh did nt exactly eliminate the reverberation but it completely got rid of the speech
__label__False hmm
__label__True and bhaskara can give you a pointer so then in any case um but paying a lit you know if i if it s uh probably for university it s it s gon na be real cheap anyway
__label__False right
__label__False no on only to the log energy
__label__False well you can do
__label__False good i see where you have it
__label__False oh good
__label__False yeah so you re trying to so you d there s a a distance between the close and the distant mike so there s a time delay there and after the time delay there s these various reflection
__label__False this is what we get after
__label__False what which test set wa this
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False i mean like u being the meeting recorder people or u being anything that speech local doe
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False hmm
__label__False yes briefly
__label__False oh i wonder i wonder if we ran out of disk space yet
__label__False ok
__label__False uh
__label__False i mean
__label__False yeah
__label__False maybe they re just inserting some nummy frame or something
__label__False yeah we we did a nons s speechnonspeech transcription adam dave and i we did for that dialogue and i trained it on that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False i mean by the time we ll have we ll have data so we can actually you know demonstrate that
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False so the only thing we ll have to be careful with is that they re well what are they listening to
__label__False yeah it s the same sheet yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yeah he wa in s
__label__False yeah um
__label__False we figured out that it wa t twelve gig twelve gigabyte an hour for for all the channel wa that with or without the
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False sure two item which wa uh digit and possibly stuff on on uh forced alignment which jane said that liz and andreas had in information on but they did nt so
__label__False so there s like level of granularity so uh there s there s um a single event of which they are both a part and they re independently they they are event which have very different character a far a sourcepathgoal whatever so when you identify sourcepathgoal and whatever there s gon na to be a desire whatever eating hunger whatever other frame you have involved they have to match up in in nice way so it seems like each of them ha it own internal structure and mapping to these schema you know from the other
__label__False but that s uh uh all that s is a a certainly relevant uh study and you know what are the feature that they re finding
__label__False yeah
__label__False so cleaning up the tidigits and if the performance go down in the tidigits mismatch high mismatch like this on a clean training or zero db testing
__label__False no
__label__False what s wrong with
__label__False i i m not too afraid ab about that a w when there when there would be something some background speech or something there wo there would be a a chunk in another channel and when there is s something in between i con i i do not concatenate them it s just when there is when they are sequentially and
__label__False mmm mmm
__label__False so i guess your question is so far i have no really arg no real argument why to differentiate between statue a statue and house of celebrity from that point of view
__label__False well they are doing that
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think there wa over but there wa also a paper on out
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you could mail it to them get an a mailing address
__label__False so when you said in town you mean oregon
__label__False wa that um there m there wa this already a script i believe uh that dan had written that uh handle bleedthrough i mean cuz you have this this close you have contamination from other people who speak loudly
__label__False i have nt looked to see how much of that we have
__label__False yeah
__label__False so they chose sixty
__label__False ok
__label__False nine one four four zero two nine three three eight
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False so so i d like to do that but i think do you maybe eh
__label__False yeah
__label__False so we know for enter that there s container potentially involved and it s not uh i do nt know if you wan na have in the same level a the action schema spg schema it it s somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the sourcepathgoal um you know goal uh goal i guess in this case so uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there s identity basically between thing and i di do nt know if that s something we need to invent or you know just
__label__False i mean if you re not doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer they they they you know you can hear the sou hear the sound just fine you know it s
__label__False yep
__label__False if you want i got it
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m not we we oh and you have nt done this either i the first time is traumatic but
__label__False but they might miss that right
__label__False well there are various point in meeting where people were making uh uh very strong statement a a matter of fact like one should nt even question it and this wa one of them that wa kind of funny
__label__False and uh nothing ha changed since then so
__label__False cuz if a beep is treated a a unique word beep
__label__False ok
__label__False which one is these the uh
__label__False well i m trying to be so
__label__False ah ok ok
__label__False so they had one recurrent net for each particular feature
__label__False well i i do nt know
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah i
__label__True doe anyone like know store or know about mike who who would know the right question to ask
__label__False right right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so you essentially take the value that th that you get from the triangular filter and extend them to sor sort of like a rectangle that s at that m value
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh good that s very good ok
__label__False so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so what
__label__False i do it uh again this develop
__label__False is it the the likelihood score below some threshold
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False so we would have
__label__False you have security issue with that
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah it s the crown
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False people say the strangest thing when their microphone are on
__label__False uh so the the right now the the system that is there in the what we have in the repository with us fifteen
__label__False uh no
__label__False there s a lot of actually
__label__False well this for each mel band
__label__False i
__label__False yeah i mean i i sort of um found the uh uh the audio of some of those and um it kind of sounded like i did nt want to trudge through that you know it wa just
__label__False that yeah e that s it that s it uhhuh
__label__False i see
__label__False o one five zero three two one seven two zero two six two four three o four four o five five four six one seven o o seven five eight six two eight three eight eight four nine eight o
__label__False but then again um in this case the domain object may contain information that we do nt really care about either
__label__False so it s always been out of phase but it now seems that um there s a good shot at that so we ve talked about it and the hope is that we can make these thing the same thing and of course it s only w in both case it s only one piece of a bigger system
__label__False no these are the s s s same noise yeah
__label__False and the the third one wo nt probably wo nt be a meeting cuz cuz uh su sunil stephane and i will all not be here
__label__False transcript l dash three o three
__label__False yeah that s true
__label__False i i i think what you do is this i when when you have this after you subtracted it i mean then you get something w w with this uh where you set the value to zero and then you simply add an additive constant again
__label__False that s what you were just saying i think
__label__False yeah so if we if we can live with the latency or cut the latency elsewhere then then that would be a uh good thing um anybody ha anybody you guy or or naren uh somebody tried the uh um second th second stream thing
__label__False right right
__label__False yeah
__label__False right it s not a big deal
__label__False but it doe say that uh if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose then you are construing the cafe a an obstacle
__label__False that i mean that the f top one doe not imply the second one
__label__False um and then the other question i wa thinking about is well a couple thing first of all if the other headset are a lot more comfortable we should probably just go ahead and get them
__label__False and so if when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn the mixed file it s possible eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system it s possible you eh in the eh i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike to eh to nnn to do the experiment with the the system it possible to evaluate eh eh or to consider eh acoustic event that which you marked eh in the mixed file but eh they do nt appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the by the mike
__label__False what s also nice and for a i for me in my mind it s it s crucially necessary is that we can have multiple schema and multiple action schema in parallel
__label__False mmm
__label__False the uh the ssh account and the user account do nt have to be similar
__label__False um i can e i can uh i ll transcribe it though it s no problem
__label__False i mean i i sux to doctorspeech w when i need to make a a directory on uh one of the
__label__False hmm
__label__False for a couple of reason
__label__False unless you wan na know if they re
__label__False oh i see
__label__False um
__label__False uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True i wa there
__label__False u uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False so um of course this will happen when we think more about the kind of verb that are used in each case but you can imagine that it s verb plus various other thing that are also not in the bottom layer that would that would help you
__label__False which mean that it s it s doing a slightly better job than the previous vad uh at a l lower delay
__label__False i m changing this
__label__False right i mean th the timing is off all over the place in just about any word
__label__False so um
__label__False it i guess it it s been around for a long time and it it s sort of um because it s so strong a word people do nt take it that seriously in it s not negatively viewed it just really mean
__label__False what what wa it trained on again the one that you used
__label__False uh either way uh i uh it helped a lot
__label__False some of them are yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False you know i mean she s going through and doing these kind of check
__label__False i do nt get it
__label__False and then if you
__label__False is that what you re
__label__False uh that s that s the other thing i mean without noise compensation certainly czero is better than log energy
__label__False he had the h
__label__False oh it wa painful because the thing is you know the alignment share a lot in common so
__label__False yeah
__label__False but in general if there s like five or six word and one word s far away from it that s probably wrong on average so um
__label__False what s the technical term
__label__False yeah
__label__False going to a web site is easy but flipping through a hundred pound a hundred page of stuff is not easy on the web
__label__False and actually i talked today to a uh undergraduate who want to do an honor thesis on this
__label__False i i mean that is is enough is enough eh to work well eh to eh separate or to distinguish eh between overlapping zone and eh speaker zone
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False in earlier experiment they had taken lda from a completely different database right
__label__False th
__label__False yeah so so this this is like so this make the delay like zero for lda because it s completely causal
__label__False and thank you very much
__label__False and i assume that s also uh your plan a well
__label__False but at that point we only want probably jane to be in control anyway and she i mean it s just an i
__label__False yes except that the command ha to not take a password
__label__False i think that it s it s nice to do that in this because in fact it s gon na give a better word error result and therefore will help within an evaluation
__label__False did you just sti did you just stick the m the the the microphone actually in the tea
__label__False uh i m looking at the italian right now
__label__True um let s see i think the only thing we had left wa unless somebody else well there s a couple thing uh one is anything that um anybody ha to say about saturday anything we should do in prep for saturday
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False uh they re good because you you you learn to distinguish between these category that you want to be good at distinguishing between
__label__False uh which is to try to emulate the normalization that we did but with the mel cepstral feature
__label__False yeah
__label__False could you cluster the just do some kind of clustering
__label__False or is that another one i m i looked through a bunch of the digit t corp corpus and now they re all blurring
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False it would once we got it set up it w it
__label__False there are two way we could listen to it there s a sound there s actually sound output built into this thing but the driver i have nt the driver may not support it yet and then there s also the sound or the sound card built in but i do nt know how to i do nt know how the operating system would like having two sound card
__label__False the the filter which filter
__label__False is it on
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False hp glike stuff or whether it s construction
__label__False oh
__label__False multifrench multispanish
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False higher level yeah
__label__False ok that is a bit more than i thought
__label__False yeah
__label__False um yeah so basically we try to uh find good feature that could be used for voicing detection uh but it s still uh on the um t we w basically we are still playing with matlab to to look at at what happened and
__label__False so anything to reduce breathing is is is a good thing
__label__False hardly anything complicated
__label__False oh it s that timefrequency tradeoff thing right
__label__False yeah
__label__False why do nt you go ahead
__label__False yeah
__label__False so i looked at them all in wave and just lined up all the alignment and at first it sort of looked like a mess and then the more i looked at it i thought ok well it s moving these word leftward and
__label__False i think it s more like are you are tourist are you in ham like heidelberg for a
__label__False mmm
__label__False so it s within speaker within phone call if it s a dialogue system it s within whatever this characteristic you re trying to get rid of is expected to be consistent over right
__label__False yeah
__label__True but they are not yet accessible the new machine
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so uh so then um
__label__False yep
__label__False this is obviously not usable right
__label__False yeah
__label__False and now you have to make a decision what do we think
__label__False or know
__label__False but um we could try anyway uh do another try at coming up with the agenda uh at some point before the meeting uh say the day before
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah you have to
__label__False so i ve been working on integrating this mean subtraction approach into the smartkom system
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but it would be nice if that piece were exactly the same piece it wa just this uh construction analyzer
__label__False is it can it be entered then of course this is sort of binary a well
__label__False uh yeah wait
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok well i m gon na start working on this the week after next so that s the point when i ll need to look more carefully at what y what what you guy have
__label__False right
__label__False i i think so i mean i i it s not exactly the th same thing but but s it it it s getting close to that
__label__False nine two four five eight four five five zero four
__label__False ah uh we were talking about dan at one point and we were talking about lokendra at another point and i do nt i do nt remember which which part
__label__False no it s just um you know they re coming for u so that we can bug them and ask them more question and sit down together and write sensible code and they can give some nice talk and stuff but uh
__label__False one seven three four eight zero seven nine three
__label__False uh the the acoustic associated with uh a particular context for instance you may have some kind of context that will never occur in one language and will occur frequently in the other so the qu the issue of getting enough training for a particular kind of context becomes harder
__label__False so did
__label__False oh man i did nt n
__label__False so the majority of them wan na have nine state
__label__False so what s the s this is what you made fey like so
__label__False well only one of
__label__False yeah
__label__False so that is the performance for italian finnish and spanish
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False actually this is tha that s why we well it s a different kind of data
__label__True srini s the one to ask i would say um he might know
__label__False but this help a lot
__label__False hmm
__label__False this is for asru
__label__False yeah there s eh the s the standard deviation of the signal give you a good clue i mean if that is too low then you can be pretty sure that it s uh empty
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i wa thinking there s all these other peo yeah
__label__False i mean
__label__False yeah it s pretty vague it s governmentrun i guess
__label__False yeah
__label__False i do nt know if that wa
__label__False right
__label__False so uh morgan just to uh since you were nt at the meeting last week uh apparently a bunch of the edu fe folk really hate this style mike
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean most people will not wan na take the time to do that though
__label__False ok
__label__False and if we need a cutdown version for something or whatever we ll worry about that later
__label__False oh ok
__label__False it s just a check box next to the text it s not any fun at all
__label__False the the way the network give the feature is that it reduce completely the it remove completely the information a lot of information from the the feature by uh uh placing the decision boundary at optimal place for one kind of data but this is not the case for another kind of data
__label__False nope
__label__False it s through the
__label__False it s a clean up thing right so echo cancelling is is you know commonly done in telephony and and and it s sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you if you know you re gon na be talking some distance from a mike
__label__False ok just checking
__label__False for yeah for the aurora
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i kn
__label__False no relation
__label__False hmm
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False very good
__label__False yeah it s pretty funny looking
__label__False i mean cuz you do nt have to visit the web page if you do nt want to
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah so the
__label__False the film ran out you know or maybe you could say something like the film is out so like the the film went away from where it should be namely with you or something right you know
__label__False i guess yeah
__label__False individual channel
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well yeah you could look at i guess that pzm or something
__label__False i do nt tend to get an invitation myself for them even
__label__False we would actually
__label__False um his idea wa to get sort of the l the list of mayor of the department the student it it s exactly how you interpreted it sort of s
__label__False i mean
__label__False it might also be potentially confusing
__label__False but the way it s done is that um for low gain there is this non nonlinear smoothing actually for low gain um
__label__False so then you ve got you already have the superstructure with gaussians and h you know simple hmms and so forth
__label__False uh and it s used for a lot of different type of data so segment whether you have segmentation or not is it male or female or not
__label__False they have a little bit but they re not noisecancelling so uh
__label__False i i
__label__False pitch
__label__False right
__label__False it s not remote
__label__False four zero eight three zero four five eight eight seven nine zero
__label__False conversation timemarked file and and then that s the that s what the
__label__False two thousand and fifteen hundred
__label__False yeah people do something they they uh they have some um uh in in cepstral mean subtraction for shortterm window analysis window a is usually done you re trying to get rid of some very general characteristic and so uh if you have any other information about what a general kind of characteristic would be then you you can do it there
__label__False uh mike number five and channel channel four
__label__False well you know i i think david might have a bunch of o old pc cuz he s replacing them with these new one maybe we could get one and just dedicate it to doing this not even hook it u well
__label__False exactly
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so uh
__label__False yeah uh i could have a look at it so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False actually i have o
__label__False yeah that s right
__label__False there s just that part of the brain is nt functioning so they ca nt do that
__label__False uh but ha he pretty much been talking about what you re doing also and
__label__False yeah
__label__False i said i wa um going to use avendano s method of um using a transformation um to map from long analysis frame which are used for removing reverberation to short analysis frame for feature calculation
__label__False and uh yeah hopefully i think what we want to have is to put these feature in s some kind of um well to to obtain a statistical model on these feature and to or just to use a neural network and hopefully these feature w would help
__label__False i mean i guess there s a lot of thing you could do to
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and they add noise on the trajectory of uh the log energy only right
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False and if you do nt compute the wavefile you ca nt zoom out you ca nt get a larger view of it but you can zoom in
__label__False but if it take sixty to one
__label__False oh
__label__False and so i m wondering if we can get a couple of tho i do nt know how good quality they are but it would be really interesting to see if they re good enough
__label__False no i do that two t did two time
__label__False uh that s future future work
__label__False five five one six nine four three five zero six
__label__False right so our our clustering is not gon na be intelligent that way it s just gon na pick up whatever energy difference or whatever is
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False ok
__label__False well tha that s that s debatable right i mean so the so the argument is that if your statistical system is good it will in fact uh clean thing up right so it it s got it own objective criterion
__label__False you know if if an andreas play around with language modeling he s not gon na be m wan na be messed up by people breathing into the microphone so it s it s uh uh
__label__False uh and um that s sort of what we re doing in this aur aurora stuff and uh it s still not clear to me in the long run whether the best thing to do would be to do that or to have some stylized version of the filter that look like these thing you ve trained up because you always have the problem that it s trained up for one condition and it is nt quite right for another so uh that s that s why that s why rasta filter ha actually ended up lasting a long time people still using it quite a bit because y you do nt change it so doe nt get any worse
__label__False close mike training
__label__True and not meet tomorrow
__label__False ok
__label__False so that s
__label__False it s probably cuz the recognition s just bad en at a point where it s bad enough that that you do nt lose anything
__label__False i
__label__False yeah w we re often asked this when we work with a system that that is nt is nt sort of industry industry standard great uh and we see some reduction in error using some clever method then you know will it work on a on a on a good system
__label__False i still have like probably six seven eight gig on my disk
__label__False i mean you re right if you have if you have uh lot and lot of data and you have and your your your training is representative of your test then getting more source of information should just help but but it s
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract task go shopping um take in uh a batch of art um
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False um
__label__False i mean i mean i doe nt i think i think the second one sound a lot more direct uh
__label__False like ok
__label__False so
__label__False yeah i see
__label__False yeah i mean a helpful i mean so that s the question
__label__False well i wa just wondering what the average length thing wa
__label__False and the only thing that cost is the backup issue eh to first order and we can take care of that by putting it on nonback up drive and just backing it up once onto this tape
__label__False and the mode you know depends on all those thing only
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False man
__label__False but
__label__False so th so what i would see is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the not just for fun
__label__False so
__label__False but but that s a refinement and i think we wan na see try the simple thing first cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that doe something good y y yo you sort of wan na see what the simple thing doe first
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False looking at all the sampling rate to make sure all the sampling rate were what eight k what i wa assuming they were um
__label__False actually you do nt get a you do nt get a nice number between zero and one you get you get either a zero or a one
__label__False oh what doe what doe asp
__label__False it s to be traini to b training data and development data for the smartkom system
__label__False now we have something like this
__label__False right
__label__False i think that that
__label__False u
__label__False oh k sorry
__label__False anyway
__label__False and um how how where is the end so that s
__label__False and then when we get them back if we see two lbeeps in a row
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s how actual probability table are specified a like list of number
__label__False so i do nt know
__label__False and we ll get the summary like this the c you know short version like
__label__False well see they i i think they re
__label__False well it will overall it will be still better even if it is fifteen percent worse because the fifteen percent worse is given like f w twentyfive point two five eight
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False nope
__label__False maybe you know
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False well there s lot of little thing it s like there re twelve different script which you run and then at the end you have what you want but um at the very last stage we throw away the actual time information all we care about is whether that there s a certain word wa overlapped by someone else s word
__label__False ok
__label__False four one two
__label__False huh
__label__False so these are result with uh th that you re describing now that they are pretty similar for the different feature or or uh
__label__False i wonder who else is
__label__False s doe the clustering do you give it sort of a target number of cluster or is it adapted in some way
__label__False close it and and load up the old state so it doe nt screw screw that up
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False i could nt find the the keywords for thing that i thought i had said wrong so
__label__False right so so those are actually sort of retrofitted into the time alignment
__label__False fff
__label__False um i i m i m still a little f think that s a little funny these thing l seems like there should be but but you do nt want to keep uh keep knocking at it if it s if you re not getting any any result with that
__label__False and you just took this thing in here because it s a neural net and neural net are wonderful and figure out what they can what they most need from thing and
__label__False mmhmm that s a good idea
__label__False oh good ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False did did did i interrupt you were there other thing that you wanted to
__label__False ah
__label__False mmhmm well adam know how to run it so you just make a f
__label__False so anyway that s that s e a quite different thing from anything we ve talked about that you know might might might come out from some of this
__label__False the d the data table
__label__False uh
__label__False but i mean if you listen to it it sound ok you know u yeah
__label__False and so i think doing that to generate these possibility and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to to do it yeah
__label__False silent
__label__False no it s the bakery itself is it a building uh that you want to go to or is it something to eat that you want to buy
__label__False i think it s a littl little farfetched nah i mean the thing is aurora s pretty closed community i mean you know the people who were involved in the the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who who made it above a certain threshold in the first round uh w in ninetynine and it s it s sort of a it s not like a
__label__False i m keeping the convention absolutely a simple a possible
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False and um so far i have morgan and hynek
__label__False i wa wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me and i only said one thing but you were talking and it wa picking up all your word
__label__False darn
__label__False by nice you mean
__label__False yeah but i think yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False can you hand me your digit form
__label__False and smoothing mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok so that count a count a a nice wall
__label__False yeah so and and if there is a book that you ll be building up some audience for it and you ll get feedback from these guy cuz they ve actually these dfki guy have done a much a anyone over the last decade in trying to build them
__label__False yeah um
__label__False yeah
__label__False and shawn
__label__False this week
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i m not really sure what s best with that the problem is a lot of them are really short and so i do nt necessarily wan na do one per line
__label__False um that ye overall yes but on this particular development test set they re actually a little worse
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False once in a while it s a backchannel sometimes it seems to be um similar to the one that are being picked up
__label__False about me or you
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False so they they approved it for all the site but only gave u like sixtytwo percent of the money
__label__False yeah th that that s c that come up to the xschema slide so basically i m gon na steal that from nancy one of nancy s st
__label__False um w i wa talking to dave gelbart about that and apparently it s not actually the parsing of the xml raw that going from the xml to an internal t tree structure is pretty fast
__label__False ok so uh unless we wan na start digging into the uh the beliefnet and the decision now which would be fine it s probably
__label__False one hundred twentyfour
__label__False can i just ask about the data like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data just cuz i m
__label__False yeah
__label__False do we have any um test set uh in any other language that um have the same noise a in the aurora
__label__False so um and it s a real simple change to make i mean it s like one little text file you edit and change those number and you do nt do anything else and then you just run
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so i mean i mostly just ignored it because i wa too busy and did nt get to it
__label__False good point
__label__False o four four five five two seven five o five five seven five three o o six seven nine one seven eight four three two seven eight six three seven five one two eight four
__label__False no
__label__False i need to calculate this and for calculate this
__label__False the big parser show
__label__False ok
__label__False and so anyway the clean those are those thing and then channelized is to then um get it into this multichannel format
__label__False you have to switch it on
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok this is uh morgan again with the wireless lapel transcript six four five five five five zero nine seven one six nine one four o seven eight nine o four five three five eight zero two one five nine one three two eight zero five three five five three six
__label__False um just qu one quickly uh still on the feature so you have these twentyfour feature uh a lot of them are spectral feature is there a a transformation uh like principal component transformation or something just
__label__False how do you know
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False if it s in the kiosk then the physical situation is the same
__label__False ok
__label__False but but they do not apply filtering of the log energy or what
__label__False wait
__label__False um and uh and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that s worded ok
__label__True oh you were there
__label__False i guess it s it s also so uh the time constraint because well we discussed about that about this problem and they told u well we will do all that s possible to have enough space for a network but then yeah perhaps they were too short with the time and uh yeah
__label__False i mean you could do it with pgp or thing like that but it s too complex
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False but if you really want to find out what it s about you have to click on the little light bulb
__label__False that wa on male
__label__False this is the uh s the schema of the xml here not an example or something like that
__label__False oh how about you carmen
__label__False four nine one one eight four seven nine
__label__False no
__label__False so so stand standing back from that you sort of say there s this very detailed representation
__label__False yeah just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of just having that training data wh what happens
__label__False yeah see i do nt know feacalc at all
__label__False but the other is it s very uh i mean even though there s i m sure the f f the the sri uh frontend ha some kind of preemphasis it s it s uh still th it s picking up lot of lowfrequency energy so even discriminating against it i m sure some of it s getting through
__label__False right
__label__False right right
__label__False in term of these would be wha how we would answer the question whereis right
__label__False well i mean just to
__label__False s seven nine six seven eight four eight five seven four one nine two six eight nine four nine seven one three two five four six four one five six eight two zero nine seven seven nine nine seven seven eight seven eight
__label__False now that we re used to recording it s like eh well why not keep going
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False o zero one two zero seven four two four one uh eight six six five four six two two six three seven eight one one six eight eight eight nine eight six nine
__label__False but only to listen to not to look at
__label__False doe something it doe nt work a well
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False huh o ok so um a actually i wa just thinking about what i wa asking about earlier wi which is about having le than say twelve second in the smartkom system to do the mean subtraction you said in system where you use cepstral mean subtraction they concatenate utterance and do you know how they address this issue of um testing versus training can
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False so
__label__False yeah they they had a had a way to translate the distance into into probability with the with the simple um uh sigmoidal function
__label__False one hundred millisecond for smoothing
__label__False but i
__label__False s um it s very important to normalize czero and much le to normalize the other coefficient and um actu uh well at least with the current online normalization scheme and we i think we kind of know that normalizing cone doe nt help with the current scheme and and yeah
__label__False um i mean are you saying that what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation or are we just dealing with arbitrary language
__label__False um why do nt we s again start off with with uh n
__label__False mmm
__label__False i thought he i thought he said in that mail that he would need to take it down another time so i think he
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm mmm
__label__False ok
__label__False ok so why do nt we plan to give you feedback electronically
__label__False mmm
__label__False um
__label__False it s a free software
__label__False well i guess if you got people who had like um you know tongue ring
__label__False go right mouse
__label__False what like just working out the rest of the
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep yep
__label__False so what appears is that perhaps spanish is not very close to italian because uh well when using the the network trained only on spanish it s the error rate is almost uh twice the baseline error rate
__label__True there s you have you have the paper right the mississippi state paper
__label__False yeah
__label__False i do nt see why not it s just a different topic
__label__False yeah
__label__False so i guess what you would do in practice is you d try to get a many uh example of similar sort of stuff a you could and then uh so the argument for that being the the the more important thing is that you re gon na try and do that but you wan na see how badly it deviate from that when when when the uh it s a little different
__label__False but even after that it s still you know so poor that that uh no one could really use it
__label__False so yeah
__label__False and it s um about nine hundred dollar for the base station and then eight hundred per channel
__label__False uh they they think it s a terrific improvement and um it real it just make a a world of difference
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False tidigits and now we have another noisy timit also with the noise of uh italian database
__label__False alrigh
__label__False are
__label__False i in fact what you could say is for enter you could say here list all the kind of schema that on the category that you know i list all the parent category it s just like a frame hierarchy right like you have these blended frame so you would say enter and you d say my parent frame are suchandsuch h and then those are the one that actually you then actually define and say how the role bind to your specific role which will probably be f richer and fuller and have other stuff in there
__label__False yeah
__label__False what s this one here this this one is ha a couple of cheezy electrettes and
__label__False yep
__label__False what i we had nt seen yet wa that if you added in the english it s still poor
__label__True doe anybody have an agenda
__label__False one of these day it should open this theoretically
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False o seven one zero one two four one five three one two six seven two o
__label__False yeah
__label__False separating
__label__False ach u
__label__False yeah yeah ok
__label__False yeah that s what i would be worried about too
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True because anyway when we go to twice a much data and have the same number of parameter particularly when it s twice a much data and it s quite diverse um i wonder if having twice a many parameter would help
__label__False if the context were to set one way or another that like strongly uh um say something about whether whether or not they re tourist so what s interesting is when it s not when it s set to unknown
__label__False four eight eight eight eight two nine eight eight
__label__False i is it um mostly um the neural network training that are um slowing u down or the htk run that are slowing u down
__label__False so what i wa thinking is we could get a few more of the sony one and just unplug them and plug them in and the only thing is that when you fill out the digit form you have to be sure to indicate which mike wa actually used
__label__False do you wan na go barry
__label__False so yeah it s rather a small
__label__False for me it s eh it s eh all overlap zone with eh several number of speaker is eh eh the same acoustic event
__label__False no
__label__True yeah the the w there wa a very long discussion about this on on the on the uh amsterdam meeting
__label__False oh oh right ok
__label__False so it so um he s got these um uh uh he and s between these different feature
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False cross
__label__False so that s that s it
__label__False chuck wa telling too many joke or something
__label__False so if you run er your recognizer with all probability equal what do you get out
__label__False herve will be giving a talk yeah talk at eleven
__label__False uh in the log domain we have something like this
__label__False but um i mean it s just tracing down these bug
__label__False i do nt know like in d
__label__False this we have to yeah yes
__label__False um
__label__False o o one zero zero zero two two five two o three six four eight three three zero zero one five seven zero seven six
__label__False it should tell u you know what kind of phenomenon could occur it should tell u also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being and the sort of difference there
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False i actually think that s useful data um the chatting but
__label__False and
__label__False uh
__label__False w we ll see anyhow um the uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean there is interesting stuff in her term of how language work so the emergentism story would be nice to be you know it would be nice to tell people how what s happening there plus how the uh language learning stuff work but
__label__False for the frame i guess i computed twotwenty yeah well it s
__label__False that s true i had nt even thought about that although it d be kind of interesting
__label__False um i mean it s also a mixture of people i mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer flipping around the web and others do not
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False huh
__label__False nah i ca nt think of a way it would be infinite
__label__False so he doe nt have
__label__False mmhmm which is yeah it s fine
__label__False so i mean wha what s the this this chart this table that we re looking at is um
__label__False the issue wa that um this is supposed to be a standard that s then gon na be fed to somebody s recognizer somewhere which might be you know it it might be a concern how many parameter are use u used and so forth and so uh they felt they wanted to set a limit
__label__False no no i i have to go to i want eh i wanted to eh compare the the transcription
__label__False i see
__label__False is nt that what it is
__label__False but more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out
__label__False oh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and we can we can see on the first line of the table that it it it s slightly slightly worse when we do nt use delta but it s not not that much
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m sure we can get other people around who do nt know anything um if we want another subject you know like i can drag ben into it or something
__label__False did did you do that or tha that s a
__label__False so a big flat structure right
__label__False well i i i dunno i i think that that s if they are in fact going to transcribe these thing uh certainly any process that we d have to correct them or whatever is need to be much le elaborate for digit than for other stuff so why not
__label__False oops
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False but that s looking at it for for classification for binary classification right
__label__False so um
__label__False i m sorry i missed it
__label__False um
__label__True what s smartkom
__label__False transcriber that if the sample rate is too low when it try to compute the shape file it fails
__label__False right
__label__False yeah th this is this r this is this is more this is probably the way that th that s the way that seemed more intuitive to johno i guess also for a while for no no no uh we have not we have not seen the light
__label__False and we can we can handle the the the type of problem we have here
__label__False and so um we we seem to have uh a reliable way of getting the data in which is through the ra sony radio mike a long a we re conscious about the battery
__label__False hhh
__label__False right ok
__label__False right
__label__False um i wa thinking more like using them a a the input to to the detector
__label__False uh no we do nt plan to fill the hole but actually there is something important is that um we made a lot of assumption concerning the online normalization and we just noticed uh recently that uh the approach that we were using wa not uh leading to very good result when we used the straight feature to htk
__label__False the b the the double arrow
__label__False um
__label__False right so
__label__False the first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of t
__label__False i appreciate that
__label__False yep
__label__False and he tested it mostly on digit because it s sort of a you know it doe nt take week to train it
__label__False yeah
__label__False you know you re not allowed to
__label__False but i do nt know how else to do it
__label__False so that s what you know that
__label__False so basically the idea is to f to feed the output of that beliefnet into another beliefnet
__label__False mmm and then i have two sheet where it s for a system where uh so it s again the same system but in this case we have spectral subtraction with a maximum overestimation factor of two point five
__label__False oh i see y why are you specifying it in xml
__label__False and we re going
__label__False no
__label__False so that s going on and also just uh working on my uh final project for jordan s class uh which is
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean usually for voicedunvoiced you d do yeah you d do something you d do energy but then you have something like spectral slope which is you get like rone ov over rzero or something like that
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False it ha some shock value
__label__False yeah ten year ago ninetyone and they re still all fine
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean it sort of get into plan recognition kind of thing in the discourse i mean that s like the bigger um version of it
__label__False so my guess about what s happening is that you know if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digit and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual word for some of them are half a long you really um have you know half a much training data for those model
__label__False but i do nt i do nt think they are
__label__False ok
__label__False it s not maybe reality
__label__False yeah
__label__False i do nt know if it would necessarily be that uh complicated but uh
__label__False i mean it make it cleaner but then uh i mean
__label__False and if they are then they ca nt be used
__label__False right
__label__False r and it right ok so you d you and so in training you would start over at at every new phone call or at every new speaker yeah ok
__label__False so that should be possible
__label__False backchannel
__label__False and um it did nt work a well so
__label__False i do nt remember
__label__False yeah
__label__False thanks
__label__False so for example um if i know where voicing occurs and everything um
__label__False i mean that it wa basically the only thing that wa even slightly surprising wa that the lapel did so well
__label__False talk about aligning people s schedule
__label__False ok so yeah so note the four node down there the sort of the thing that are not directly extracted
__label__False pretty hokey
__label__False yeah so what happened since um last week is well from ogi these experiment on putting vad on the baseline
__label__False i think i think the file server could become an issue a we get a whole bunch more new compute machine and we ve got you know fifty machine trying to access data off of abbott at once
__label__False transcript l dash f fiftyfour
__label__False and i m also thinking these people are a terrific pool i mean if uh so i i told them that um we do nt know if this will continue past the end of the month and i also m i think they know that the data p source is limited and i may not be able to keep them employed till the end of the month even although i hope to
__label__False or subtract nothing and and that s that s i guess that s something that s p people have figured out how to deal with in cepstral mean subtraction a well
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah it wa fortyfive minute
__label__False yeah so it d be a lot of overhead to type
__label__False and then i think what you do is you introduce some some artificial distribution in this uh in in the model i mean i you you train it also this way but i somehow there is u u there is no longer a a gaussian distribution it is somehow a strange distribution which we introduce with these artificial distortion
__label__False pop go the data
__label__False maybe
__label__False um if you have them professionally pressed y you know they re good for decade
__label__False it s i i understand that s fine with me i i g would say that um i find this model easier to adjust that s one of the reason i do nt like these cuz i keep m you know bending it and then it s n and i never really know
__label__False we just sent it to ibm we we sorta spotchecked it
__label__False oh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the problem f for me wa to find a consistent threshold that work well across the different database because i t
__label__False yeah
__label__False killing machine
__label__False turn about is fair play sorry
__label__False sort of you know back up from the system that he had
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False no
__label__False um
__label__False um yeah so and the fff comment seems from the reviewer are good so
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah that that becomes another problem actually
__label__False beyond the mike the cost of the mike the only thing is the base station that s nine hundred dollar
__label__False i would think that you might wan na do something like uh you know look at a few point to see where you are starting to get significant search error
__label__False and uh
__label__False but it s a um simple solution we can just um go downstairs and and and look at this but maybe not today
__label__False so we could actually have eight people with with headset mike with i mean basically no extra effort
__label__False and they just filled it in
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh what i wa gon na say is a soon a possible and i m willing to not work for an hour to get it done
__label__False uh we do nt but it s just i mean the main thing is that since that we got burned last time and you know by not worrying about it very much we re just staying conscious of it
__label__False for me is the overlapping zone because because you you have s you have more one eh more one voice eh eh produced in a in in a moment
__label__False yeah
__label__False actually that s something i wanted to ask is i have a bunch of script to help with the transcription of the digit
__label__False yeah i
__label__False how do we decide how to answer it
__label__False and another one is turn like people starting with
__label__True the first bad version ll be done in nine month
__label__False five nine nine seven nine eight five one eight two
__label__False right
__label__False and tha
__label__False i sent bresset sent brian a message about the meeting and i have nt heard back yet
__label__False yeah oh and by the way speaking of data um are there
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i guess we were thinking in term of a switch that actually
__label__False i guess
__label__False whether you would transform together or just one
__label__False oh great
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False and and so it seems it seems really unlikely to me that there s only one
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah make yourself a note so and and of course keith would like the german a well a the english so whatever you guy can get
__label__False but well both online normalization approach seems equivalent
__label__False ok
__label__False ah ok
__label__False uh now i m interested in um uh looking at the experiment where you use um uh data from multiple language to train the neural net
__label__False cool
__label__False yeah mmhmm
__label__False did nt do it
__label__False i just realized that i had my hand in between my mouth and my micr er my and my microphone
__label__False at twenty
__label__False were they burned or were they pressed
__label__False o zero nine four five one o three two four one one five five four nine nine two six six three seven seven nine eight eight zero zero two eight five nine o seven o
__label__False it say baseline asp
__label__False ok so now once you get that that one then you then you do a first or secondorder or something taylor series expansion of this
__label__False really
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False right
__label__False ah
__label__False u to begin with
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah so for the italian the result are uh stranger um
__label__False actually
__label__False yeah that s right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no
__label__False nah
__label__False fft filter bank yeah
__label__False and we re on
__label__False different prototype which is like a different initialization for the uh s transition probability
__label__False so i wo nt be here for
__label__False any i mean maybe not
__label__False hmm
__label__False so you re just saying like what part of town the thing are in or whatever
__label__False yeah right
__label__False um
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False mmm
__label__True but it seems like you should do both right
__label__False but a far a you know uh with with any luck we ll be able to wind down the larger project
__label__False i think i th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key
__label__False hand one
__label__False uh transcript number one nine nine one two o one zero
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False s so i m i m sorry there s there s there s how many how many input
__label__False uh is there anything we can give back beyond th the sort of minimum requirement
__label__False but i think you re probably doing the right thing to look for bug first
__label__False so the person may select huehner rennen or whatever
__label__False so he ha a nice set up that they it w it will be efficient for them to do that
__label__False i m flying out there the sunday before so
__label__False i guess i ll leave my microphone on
__label__False so the the only issue is then if we need access to them
__label__False yes that s true
__label__False super super ok great
__label__False how would we do that with the hybrid system
__label__False yeah so if the network is trained on the task data um tandem work pretty well and uh actually we have uh result are similar
__label__False well it s but i
__label__False i i missed the v i m sorry i wa i wa distracted i missed the very first sentence so then i m a little lost on the rest what what what
__label__False hmm
__label__False and just swap them in and out
__label__False uh
__label__False is it like
__label__False um
__label__False yeah so they are this is there is le difference
__label__False o one four zero one one eight one three one one six two five three four six eight one three four five zero six zero one seven one one two eight three three six o eight o nine six five
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False simultaneous digit chocolate task
__label__False ok anyway so the trip the report on these the last we we sort of interrupted you guy telling u about what happened last week
__label__False the idea is that we need to have we need to provide the transcript to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out section they do nt want so i ve written a bunch of tool that will generate web page uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece piece and they can scroll through and read them and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False too many adju too many adjustment yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False since uh since i have to leave a usual at threethirty can we do the interesting stuff first
__label__False someone from the class
__label__False yeah for nois noise cancelling
__label__False well there there there
__label__False uh maybe that s not the right thing to do
__label__False thanks
__label__False and what i wa saying is that the only thing i think that it buy you is um based on whether you feed it something different
__label__False the lapel is typically worse on the on clothes rustling but if no one s rustling their clothes
__label__False ok
__label__True and also i ve been talking to um andreas and thilo about the um smartkom language model and about coming up with a good model for um far mike use of the smartkom system so i m gon na be working on um implementing this mean subtraction approach in the farmike system for the smartkom system i mean and um one of the experiment we re gon na do is um we re gon na um train the a broadcast news net which is because that s what we ve been using so far and um adapt it on some other data um an andreas want to use um data that resembles read speech like these digit reading because he feel that the smartkom system interaction is not gon na be exactly conversational
__label__False and the idea of these method is to n given a um how do you say
__label__False that d be great
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False but
__label__False why do nt they not look at improvement but just look at your av your score you know figure out how to combine the score with a weight or whatever and then give you a score here s your score and then they can do the same thing for the baseline system and here s it score and then you can look at
__label__False this is quite the same tendency with a slight increase of the error rate uh if we go to to timit
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False there s a couple other question that i have too and and one of them is what about uh consent issue
__label__False we we we talked about that s but so it s a bootstrapping thing and the thing is the idea wa i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway and and then whatever he could mark would be helpful and we could
__label__False so yeah i think that s that s a good point th th that the date the uh a lot of the this is interacting with uh people in italy but also definitely the people in leipzig and the
__label__False right
__label__False so w w
__label__False well it definitely help with um forced alignment too because you know whe when we know the the the true word and we re adding them to the vocabulary and training a language model and so forth for future meeting especially the like the frontend meeting or meeting with a lot of jargon in them that is not represented in switchboard or
__label__False but
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False um with th with the display like even if we i think that even if we did nt display the waveform it might be better to rather play the waveform than display it
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s uh i mean the the frontend is f i tha that s in the sri recognizer is very nice in that it doe a lot of thing on the fly but it unfortunately is not designed and um like the uh icsi system is where you can feed it from a pipeline of of the command so the what that mean probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to uh dump out um you know if you want to use some new feature you have to dump them into individual file and give those file to the recognizer
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so i mean i i guess that wa something i could say would be that we ve talked a little bit about you just doing it all with complex arithmetic and uh and not not uh doing the polar representation with magnitude and phase but it look like there s way that one could potentially just work with the complex number and and and in principle get rid of the effect of the average complex spectrum
__label__True and did you uh forward morgan brian s thing
__label__False hmm
__label__False i see
__label__False yeah if somebody ha something to say
__label__False ok
__label__False well how about you give me one of those and we can fill it out and morgan can read and then we can do it like that
__label__False transcript l dash three zero zero five one two four eight nine zero two four three
__label__False no no
__label__False maybe just put a link on yeah by the way there something that i did nt know until about a week ago or so is apparently there are separate brain area for thing within reach and thing that are out of reach
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False so i wonder is it wa there their experimentation with uh say throwing away that filter or something and uh
__label__False huh oh ok
__label__False it seems like you could hold some meeting you know you and maybe adam you you could you could maybe hold some additional meeting if you wanted
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah you re trying to add in france telecom tell them about the rest of it like you said the number of filter might be different or something right or
__label__False um i think it would be ne neat at some point in this to do um a recognition uh pas on one of the pzm mike for these s same meeting that you ve been gi n gi bi i mean it s gon na be terrible but you know we we just do nt know how terrible
__label__False and they re both nice guy so you may may want to
__label__False well
__label__False huh
__label__False i see so that given that you re using the vad also the effect of the vt is not so far
__label__False now the other que related question though is is uh what s the boot model for these thing
__label__False i wan na ask um so you know that the data i v i have upgraded it considerably so i ve probably made
__label__False yeah
__label__False how many more you got
__label__False but they seem like two separate issue right i mean
__label__False i see
__label__False yeah
__label__False often no but uh whenever you are more than welcome if you think that this kind of discussion get you anywhere in in your life then uh you re free to c
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False so uh yep i mean that that wa sort of one i mean the overall result seemed to be first place in in in the case of either um artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so the ff t is on everything but the filter um for instance ignore the the lowest bin and the highest bin
__label__False that s interesting
__label__False do we have new dd disk also
__label__False i g yeah
__label__False uh try it yeah
__label__False they re pretty pretty specialized
__label__False the th
__label__False yeah
__label__False there were the false alarm
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False um yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah ma maybe we can i mean at least um i ll t s run some experiment to see whether once i have this noise compensation to see whether thirteen and fifteen really matter or not
__label__False others would consider it this uh a a set of skill that they would have to gain
__label__False yeah it s great
__label__False yeah or even i could you know i could do the actual
__label__False oh really
__label__False and this this one is right at the end of the table ok
__label__False yeah
__label__True quite possibly oh oh sorry sorry wednesday yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh what question are we gon na ask uh now that i mean we should probably turn shortly to this og i note
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False well it s not precisely
__label__True and um so these are the demo for the uh july uh meeting and um
__label__False they should all be in india right now that s where the good but the cheap english speaker are
__label__False ok
__label__False well it s not a secret i mean we re you know certainly willing to talk about it with everybody but i think i think that um um it s probably best to start talking with him just to
__label__False and other than that
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False alright
__label__False uh i mean there there s two suggestion really which is uh what we said before is that um it look like at least that you have nt found an obvious way to normalize so that the energy is anything like a reliable uh indicator of the overlap
__label__False so that s it i think for the online normalization
__label__False ok
__label__False uh they did nt report it if they did
__label__True and update on sri recognition experiment
__label__False well maybe their friend said they were going to meet them in a bakery around the area
__label__False transcript three seven five one dash three seven seven zero eight five five seven three zero six nine six six o
__label__False is the
__label__False well they must be dealing with large amount of data if they re transcribing anyway
__label__False o zero two two eight two o three four eight four seven zero
__label__False this is one eh this is the composition of the dictionary
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok which is uh epf l
__label__False yeah pastry is what i m talking about
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False n no not that one that s that s a the sort of background this is the t uh page five
__label__True so other topic is uh the ibm transcription status stuff so we ve sent a few to them we ve gotten a few back
__label__False yeah
__label__False cuz i looked at uh avendano s thesis and
__label__False um
__label__False can i ask one question about his statistic so so in the tw twelve minute um if we took three hundred and divided it by four which is about the length of twelve minute i
__label__False hmm ok
__label__False so
__label__False oh
__label__False that wa one of our concern
__label__False whether it s practically speaking enterable or actually physically enterable or not
__label__False right so in the digit in most most case there were nt other people talking so
__label__False that s
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah i do nt think i would make that leap because i in narrative you know i mean if you spell out everything in a narrative it can be really tedious so
__label__False which is
__label__False um and you know you can actually say thing like um
__label__False so let s let s try to do that sometime ok ch ok
__label__False yep
__label__False r right
__label__False yeah
__label__False same thing
__label__False it seems yeah um
__label__False yeah
__label__False but uh
__label__False so uh
__label__False but
__label__False like the hlt paper
__label__False huh
__label__False we we did nt cut those out
__label__False so basically you give some time constraint for for the reference and for for the hypothesis and yeah ok
__label__False and uh they uh
__label__False uh t
__label__False and maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two
__label__False you know i can i can use that later with reference to intercoder reliability kind of issue
__label__False i do nt know it if if we want to uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well
__label__False so you know happen to know how what what sooner or later mean like in practice
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah that make sense to check all that
__label__False state
__label__False and uh
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmm
__label__False right
__label__False w we re saying beep yeah for instance
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah oh is it a takehome final who s doing this
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False could i hit hit fseven to do that on the
__label__False but i mean the thing is people use those little mike for everything because they re really not bad
__label__False so
__label__False right
__label__True um are the are the sample data that you guy showed sometime ago like the thing maybe maybe you re gon na run a trial tomorrow i mean i m just wondering whether the ac some the actual sentence from this domain will be available cuz it d be nice for me to like look if i m thinking about example
__label__False that that wa basically it not not much
__label__False i understand no i just i just wa suggesting that it s not a bad policy p potentially so we need to talk about this later
__label__False y yeah oh yeah
__label__False uh whereas the other one doe sort of expand a you have more training data it doe it automatically actually
__label__False yeah into two piece yeah
__label__False le robust yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False s
__label__False but aside from that is there anything in particular that anybody want to bring up for today
__label__False but that s interesting
__label__False uh just have a bigger hidden layer
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we can do a little demo
__label__False and we ve looked at it so we know it s working i mean you can see the little squiggle and it look like speech so you just ca nt listen
__label__False right
__label__False um
__label__False good to know
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False wh when you showed me the your table last week
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that s great
__label__False right
__label__False oh my god
__label__False and uh
__label__False so what are you gon na do i mean it will w the person if you re looking up at the board and i disable the screensaver you will see that the mike is off but that doe nt necessarily help
__label__False six eight five zero nine one three nine four six four eight
__label__False i think it s the czero using czero instead of log energy yeah it s this
__label__False i guess if anybody ha additional suggestion w yeah
__label__False oh i see
__label__False so we ll perhaps try to convince ogi people to use the new the new filter and yeah
__label__False for r w what test set
__label__False that might work too yeah i wa just thinking that actually temporally just uh uh uh an increasing tone so that they would really have a sense of whether they were going you know forward or backward or yeah
__label__False so is this is a situation are is all the thing which can be happening right now
__label__False plus it s gon na introduce delay
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so what s th
__label__False i mean if in term of the alignment actually all we would need is we would nt even need word we would need a general speech model and a beep model
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False ooo yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False the outer layer
__label__False so how i mean clearly it s gon na be good then but the question is how much worse is it if you have broad data
__label__False this is date and time
__label__False one more remark uh concerning the sri recognizer um
__label__False darn
__label__False because what happens then is you scan across the signal and once in a while you ll find a blip that did nt show up in the presegmentation
__label__False it s probably a good place to start
__label__False so yeah why do nt we do the speechnonspeech discussion
__label__False well we we know what they read because we have the form
__label__False so i think it s kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it now in term of like editing it by hand i mean i think it s i some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited but but it seems to me that sometimes um you know i if a person had a bad day and they had a tone in their voice that they did nt really like you know it s nice it s nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that wa ok
__label__False so yeah
__label__False sri system when trained with icsi feature
__label__False what s that oh i guess it
__label__False sunil just described
__label__False so what you have now is fort uh forty for the the noise twenty for the delta and ten for the lda that s seventy millisecond of stuff which wa formerly in parallel right
__label__False so ok so i think this brings me up to date a bit
__label__False and it demonstrates why it doe nt work because you really wan na go acro more than one meeting
__label__False it s another
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so i mean the the point is that like the meeting um so far that i ve been at have been sort of been geared towards this demo and then that s going to go away pretty soon
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm that s true but it it save so much time the the transcriber just enormous enormous saving fantastic
__label__True the the itrs are you know a a long shot and so it s it s really nice that we got that
__label__False yeah
__label__False liz you could also just use the other mike if you re having problem with that one
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah you we ca nt complain
__label__False a in four day
__label__False not really
__label__False transcript two six three one two six five zero three zero zero five one four o six six two two five six seven seven seven three eight nine one eight one nine
__label__False but uh uh because that s what you were just doing with this ten percent
__label__False well that s
__label__False yeah
__label__False so th i m sure that we have uh fresh you know information on them
__label__False oh man
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False so you know mak re making reference to building a institution a container a build you know whatever
__label__False in the text they say that this this is a tentative block diagram of a possible configuration we could think of
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False transcript l one forty eight
__label__False you know with one of the r shortrange wireless
__label__False you mean training digit on one language and using the net to recognize on the other
__label__False ok
__label__False and uh they may be willing to record it uh with
__label__False um where wh where where wa um
__label__False but you d get all the other distinction you know randomly wrong i mean there d be nothing to tell you that
__label__False cool
__label__False um
__label__False we have new equipment that i m gon na try to set up tomorrow
__label__False around uh let s say twenty perc twenty percent further so yeah
__label__False yeah so now the afternoise compensation the neural net is seeing a different set of snrs than that wa originally there in the training set
__label__False i it s ver it s interesting
__label__False just you you just ta you just set it for a particular signaltonoise ratio that you want
__label__False well whatever
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False well i think people just had it wa nt that they purposely braindamaged it i think people had nt really thought through about the uh the vad issue
__label__False and that s where it come from yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False vacation
__label__False then you have uh mf m and me which are for french spanish and english
__label__False navigational cue
__label__False you you did get me to thinking about i i m not really sure which is more frequent whether f f laughing i think it may be an individual thing some people are more prone to laughing when they re speaking
__label__False you could use um uh like feacalc and s just specify a an output format the the oh ok
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah the ordering is nt very clear on
__label__False were you interrupting him or wa he interrupting you
__label__False oh
__label__False and
__label__False but i d i d it it i it s all worth looking at but it sound to me like uh looking at the relationship between this and the speech noise stuff is is is probably a key thing
__label__False no f no so from the point where we s take it it s faster
__label__False uh de which is where we re putting all the meeting stuff
__label__False uh well
__label__False i mean
__label__False sixt s sixtyfour so anything le than sixtyfour is zero
__label__False but if you said something for which there wa no construction whatsoever n people would nt have any idea what you were talking about
__label__False so you can specify a different number of filter and whatever um uh you specify the last one are gon na be ignored so that that s a way that you sort of change what the what the bandwidth is
__label__False so
__label__False but you re only talking about a percent or two right here were we re saying that we there gee there s this b eh there s this difference here
__label__False cool
__label__False i see
__label__False no
__label__False this is the noisy yeah it s of the value
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False m
__label__False i guess there is no there s there s no shortage of meeting so we can afford we can a
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i mean i think
__label__False yeah it could be not a coincidence
__label__False but still
__label__False yep yep yep ok
__label__False what are the snrs in the training set timit
__label__False right
__label__False um let me pas this out by the way
__label__False well i still do nt know who he is
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False just we certainly have their email
__label__False um wa this i i think he talked about the idea of like um he wa talking about these lexicalized uh uh tree adjoining grammar where you sort of for each word you um for each lexical item the lexical entry say what all the uh tree are that it can appear in and of course that s not v
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False so what else
__label__False uh anyway i should nt say too much but um if someone came that wa great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring how much data will i have to work with with that person and so it s
__label__False well i
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah exactly it s i met someone at the bakery you know in the victoria station t you know train station london before yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah that would be interesting
__label__False o zero nine nine five one
__label__False oh my goodness
__label__False hu well ok
__label__False basically just refine some of the more general node
__label__False um it seems to improve on the wellmatched case um but it s a little bit worse on the mismatch and highlymismatched
__label__False so if you add these component it go t to a hundred and seventy right
__label__False um
__label__False can i move a little bit with this yeah
__label__False and so morgan and i were uh discussing um s uh s a form of a cheating experiment where we get um we have uh um a chosen set of feature or acoustic event and we train up a hybrid um system to do phone recognition on timit
__label__False um and for these s two system we have like fiftyfive point uh fivepercent improvement and fiftyeight point one
__label__False uh and that s probably a reason why yeah online normalization help because it it yeah it removed this mean
__label__False ok
__label__False um
__label__False yes we have
__label__False what do you mean um
__label__False cuz they
__label__False we might wan na revisit hiring our own external transcription company
__label__False is this is true is it not
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False ok right
__label__False so um have you had a chance to do this um thing we talked about yet with the uh um
__label__False and you do just the farfield for those region
__label__False just plain plps or mfccs
__label__False yeah but you know a opposed to the log in the other case i mean the fundamental d d difference that we ve seen any kind of difference from before which is actually an advantage for the pl p i uh i think is that the the smoothing at the end is autoregressive instead of being cepstral uh from cepstral truncation
__label__False yeah
__label__False you know i asked her very specifically about this clause of how um you know it say no individual will be identified uh in any publication using the data ok well individual being identified let s say you have a a snippet that say
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False it s pretty distinct
__label__False how about over th from the front of the room
__label__False yep
__label__False we are
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False roughly yeah
__label__False any subword level thing
__label__False so it s always noisy basically and well the
__label__False pretty soon
__label__False nine one three one three o eight eight six seven
__label__False right yeah yeah yeah yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s true
__label__False mmm
__label__True g actually could you email me a reference to that paper if you have it cuz i m sorta curious how what criterion it ha
__label__True um yeah there wa a conference call this tuesday
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False uh ye uh uh b i uh i u i understand uh but
__label__False at least i could nt see any kind of control for that
__label__False yeah we ll just go buy them i guess
__label__False four nine eight o o o seven zero nine
__label__False no i
__label__False keep in touch
__label__False and then do other thing play with the spectral subtraction and retry the msg and thing like that
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah possible
__label__False which is roughly that
__label__False true
__label__False ok alright alright alright
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False you know it s an obvious one but uh
__label__False yeah but it it
__label__False yeah mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False right well then it s not a linear f fit you re not fitting anything then
__label__False but the way the feature give
__label__False i i i can correct and and and to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file
__label__False for realizing we do nt
__label__False uh and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some some sentence no right yeah for a couple
__label__False oh it s it affect th
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s separable yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False and deal with
__label__False so
__label__False so
__label__False where where is this where is this fiftyseven point o two in in comparison to the last evaluation
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well i think what i wa s i thought what i wa saying wa that um at any given point you are gon na start off with what you had from before
__label__False um a couple of them were like people at ibm who were here for one of the ibm meeting and one a guy from sri who wa at one of the sri meeting
__label__False i did nt say that i did nt say that
__label__False but
__label__False or maybe they re not
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False or three day
__label__False see i should listen yeah
__label__False right
__label__False the idea here is that
__label__False so um uh yeah right now it seems that i i just tested on speechdatcar while the experiment are running on your on tidigits
__label__False so
__label__False which i do nt think is this
__label__False and we did mention who he wa
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False noun go to you know
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False y
__label__False ok so then the question i so then my question is t to you then would be
__label__False no there is um
__label__False this this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language and he gave the example in his talk about how um e a i m remembering it just off the top of my head right now but it s something about how um i joe slipped you know john had washed the floor or something like that
__label__False yeah
__label__False no it s ok it s it ll work
__label__False and and information on object in german english and japanese and there is a huge uh project on spatial description uh difference in spatial description
__label__False i thought there wa something like that that he showed me last week
__label__False um
__label__False and the notion is if you have the full spectrum with all the little nittygritty detail that that ha the effect of both and it would be a multiplication in in frequency domain so that would be like an addition in log power spectrum domain
__label__False i see
__label__False i could have misread the web page i have a habit of doing that but
__label__False ok
__label__False thanks
__label__False and what s happened here is that we so we have this kind of new um reference system which use a nice a a clean downsamplingupsampling which use a new filter that s much shorter and which also cut the frequency below sixtyfour hertz which wa not done on our first proposal
__label__False alright
__label__False right
__label__False but but i did nt understand
__label__False but eh tsk ehhh
__label__False well i i do nt feel bad about it at all because because you are on the uh title i mean on the the you re that s see that s you
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but uh the problem is training set are nt perfect and testing set are different
__label__False you know you re sort of getting most of the way there but there s a
__label__False there is a couple piece to it
__label__False and and then when you d display different thing it s fine
__label__False uh we have nt been doing any of the ld a rasta sort of thing
__label__False and uh then i have a bunch of script that we ll read those and let the uh transcriber use different tool and i just want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those
__label__False e
__label__False wa just looking through the log file and
__label__False and i should say that uh you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly
__label__False so we will uh
__label__False i can calculate i can i calculated this value uh with the statistic of the noisy speech that i calculated before with the vt approximation
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False because we can write
__label__False carroll ninetythree
__label__False uh it s th it s there on that web and uh on that i mean they have run some experiment using various insertion penalty and all those
__label__False uh this is the noisy speech
__label__False so
__label__False i mean the the feature i guess i m not it s hard for me to exactly s
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True when is the development set i mean the uh uh test set result due
__label__False and uh they re doing a travel task
__label__False uh so the ok so the other thing is the
__label__False oh we ll do the higher math later maybe but it s so it s so maybe like a gig or two a an hour um but um
__label__False yeah so this ll take some thought cuz we have we um
__label__False somebody used it recently
__label__False but not to modify them right just to read them
__label__False oh this moved in the yeah
__label__False anyway so this is
__label__False ok
__label__False and here the the worst system still reduced the error rate by thirtythree percent or something in development set
__label__False although really uh uh a couple three percent uh difference in word error rate uh could easily come from some difference in normalization i would think
__label__False oh
__label__False oh sorry
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False of timit because in the timit it wa zero to some clean
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i ll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done
__label__False uh so
__label__False um but yeah i assume that this wa not important because uh previous result from from dan and show that basically the both both value g give the same same uh result
__label__False but i what i m saying is what s between the beep we do nt really care about
__label__False then
__label__False yeah i had tried doing it by hand at one point with a very short sample and it worked pretty well but i have nt worked with it a lot
__label__False or cantonese a the case may be
__label__False i i wa i do wan na um
__label__False so uh
__label__False um or we could try some automated method
__label__False y you have you have fiftysix point four and and and dependent on this additive constant it is s better or or worse yeah
__label__False and how wa it
__label__False but i th
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False i i i you know i m in i m in a state of exhaustion or something like that which a tourist w huh
__label__False so there s probably there s three to four a week that we re aiming for
__label__False so instead of having eight processor that were eight hundred megahertz we ended up with two that are five hundred and fifty megahertz
__label__False hmm
__label__False but say if if you had a a cardioid mike or something sitting someplace then sitting there then it would it it response to him would be about the same a the response to him and so on
__label__False three one o eight nine six three five one zero
__label__False open with
__label__False th t i m just ignorant about the sof software architecture of this thing
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok so it s sort of like division when you do the yeah the spectrum
__label__False i am fey yeah hi
__label__False so i ll just go d i ll do that
__label__False so
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah we we we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction right that s where the instructor the person we are going to hire um and the subject sit down together with these high level thing and so th the q first question for the subject is so these are thing you know we thought a tourist can do is there anything that interest you
__label__False wow
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh i know what it wa
__label__False tonic
__label__False no i we plan to start this uh so act actually we have discussed uh um these what we could do more a a a a research and and we were thinking perhaps that uh the way we use the tandem is not
__label__False no my my but this is too big for my head so i mean it doe nt you know it s sit
__label__False yeah
__label__False one three one three seven four nine three nine three
__label__True look at the data
__label__False right
__label__False so the so that that s the first thing i c uh i could make out from this stuff and
__label__False um
__label__False transcript l two o seven seven zero five six five one two nine zero seven four zero seven two two nine six two two five eight nine six five seven two three eight five eight zero zero six six two four eight one three seven eight five six four zero zero six five zero seven zero four eight seven four five one five three two four seven one seven four five six four eight one three nine nine
__label__False i think maybe it s dan elli is going to be doing uh a different cancellation um
__label__False mmm
__label__False ok
__label__False yep
__label__False forget about the one where it s all sort of middle ground
__label__False compared to these number
__label__False if you have a strong fe if you have a strong preference you could use this it s just we we think it ha some spike so uh we we did nt use that one
__label__False no i m sorry
__label__False so is it a experimental setup for the um data collection totally ready determined
__label__False i think they re probably going over and over f section and then they get confused about whether they ve already put that beep or if they heard you know three beep in a row wa that three or two and
__label__False there s a little utility that will manually burn a tape for you and that s probably the right way to do it
__label__False we we we may just need to uh
__label__False ok so that wa all i had for now
__label__False no
__label__False no
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the speech the representation that go to the htk is really clean speech because it s from the dictionary the code book and maybe from that i do nt know
__label__False ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False so american beauty is american beauty right yeah
__label__False nine o o
__label__False but like run into an old friend it probably need it own construction
__label__False yes that s
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False let s see
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False they are very different when energy s lower like during fricative or during speech pause
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but this issue of the content of the meeting in an outline form
__label__False yeah but if it s architecturally significant you might be able to see it from
__label__False mmm
__label__True switch between application
__label__False i i i want to use to to nnn eh to put i i it s a reference for me
__label__False wait they re building a building in the shape of dna is that what you said
__label__False so so they they re gon na they re gon na have to make speaker assignment or something like this
__label__False i mean you have nt you have nt done all your test on multiple language
__label__False right
__label__False but eh my idea is to to process only nnn this eh nnn this kind of s of eh speech
__label__False i mean maybe the where is something question a a whole you know can be construed a u i locational versus instructional request
__label__False it hopefully brings other people up to date a bit
__label__False right
__label__False to
__label__False so you ve been working with these guy you know what s going on
__label__False you know f casual user who are just browsing can just r get it readonly ca nt check in to the archive
__label__False but there is a user doctorspeech
__label__False th the way we set the probability might not have
__label__False yes
__label__False you can compute uh the posterior probability of one subset of the node given some other node but totally ignore some other node also
__label__False uh and we also have these we have the advantage of having distant mike too so that you cou yo
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False um if i did that is someone gon na be working on it
__label__False heidelberg
__label__False you know a lot of the the case it s is
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False so
__label__False oh that s clean oh ok
__label__False that s probably one of the reason
__label__False it no because i did it i started working on italian i obtained this average energy and then i used this one
__label__False and the
__label__False so keep it away from that end of the table
__label__False um um the i i m really very for i m extremely fortunate with the people who uh applied and who are transcribing for u they are um um uh really perceptive and very um and i m not just saying that cuz they might be hearing this
__label__False um
__label__False they have a um a device that you put the cassette in and it ha a foot pedal that let you go back and forth and stuff like that so
__label__False oh ok
__label__False yeah absolutely i mean the digit do nt take up that much time
__label__False uh who s that
__label__False and
__label__False ok
__label__False so
__label__False to the just the energy or to the mel uh to the mel filter
__label__False right
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah i ll i ll i ll write him an
__label__False mmhmm very different from speech
__label__False ok
__label__False i mean the the old bakery example might be nice is there a bakery around here so if you c we really just construe it a a
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False so we re not increasing the number of channel
__label__False yeah by fixing up transcript
__label__False and i wa telling don do not take this a an example of how people should work
__label__False y y
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True and uh so i think it look pretty good but i ll let liz look at it and see what she think
__label__False and they put the number in when they hear it
__label__False but i mean the meeting are gon na be the same way so uw record a meeting we transcribe it
__label__False it s not that
__label__False and so i s i specified instead of you know sixteen thousand or eight thousand i specified a hundred
__label__False transcript two eight three one dash two eight five zero one eight six seven zero six five two three four zero six one seven seven six three eight five one nine seven seven five six
__label__False uh
__label__False hmm
__label__False no i m not talking about one that are already recorded
__label__False these are
__label__False oh yeah i actually implemented the wiener f f fil filtering a a module and then tested it out separately and it it it gave like i just got the signal out and it it wa ok
__label__False um i know that when you figured out the filter that we re using for the mel scale there wa some experimentation that went on at at uh at ogi
__label__False yep
__label__False if it s you know if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing or do you point or i do nt know
__label__False thirtyfour
__label__False but it s you know it it s yeah
__label__False no
__label__False yeah that wa me
__label__False i do nt know i guess for some particular database you might find that you could tune that and tweak that to get that a little better but i think that in general it s not that critical i mean there s
__label__False no i earlier i went and bhaskara went and you did it you did it
__label__False absolutely i agree
__label__False four zero three six three five one four three one
__label__False ok
__label__False we store we store our data on popcorn
__label__False the data which we are collecting here
__label__False and the noise is different in th
__label__False oh
__label__False we re we re doing better i mean we re getting better recognition i mean i m sure other people working on this are not sitting still either but but but uh
__label__False i ve already done five or six set
__label__False so
__label__False uh i do the experiment using only the f onl eh to use on only one fair estimation of the noise
__label__False and i in in a way similar to either enterviewapproach you may want to send a letter read a letter or dictate a letter let s say
__label__False transcript l dash fifty three
__label__False got ta go
__label__False bigger is worse this is error rate i think
__label__False ab about how much
__label__False that wa one six seven seven eight o two five
__label__False give u a couple more wireless channel
__label__False i m just misremembering
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i i think that s a really good idea because for all kind of study we do nt really enjoy meeting where some of the where the signal s going off at time it just make it hard to study any kind of parameter so if there s a way to check the signal quality before transcribing it and you find any problem at all it d be much better to go to another meeting i think
__label__False no no just the yeah
__label__False cuz they re gon na be transcribing it in a few day
__label__False ok what what are the different uh class to to code uh the the overlap you will use
__label__False and um
__label__False we have one
__label__False and this wa this lda uh tuning perhaps and
__label__False so that s that s that s enough then ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False whatever the language model say
__label__False markham probably need u
__label__False what would it uh connect to like what would uh it affect
__label__False wonder if the one before that were shortened
__label__False and then the second p i mean you could do it that way or you could
__label__False well all of them are all of our all of our meeting have a lot of jargon in them but we know what those word are
__label__False that s great
__label__False oh yeah uh
__label__False i mean anybody who s training something up could choose to put it eh to u include this or not i i would not say it wa part of the meeting corpus it is nt
__label__False i assume you re saying you want me to get back to it
__label__False right
__label__False o five o five zero seven zero one zero zero nine one two three o seven nine eight eight o five seven six three nine seven seven one eight eight nine
__label__False huh
__label__False right so so um
__label__False i m sort of lookin at the point where i wan na know what should i change in the htk backend in order to try to uh to improve it
__label__False ok
__label__False so the person said um
__label__False yeah ok do you think that s something i should just send to him or do you think i should send it to this there s an a m a mailing list
__label__False so the discourse refers to admission fee but it just turn out that they change their mind in the middle of the discourse
__label__False a part of it yeah
__label__False doe stm do it per word or por per utterance
__label__False and that snr may not be like com covering the whole set of snrs that you re getting in the speechdatcar
__label__False do we have htk source is that
__label__False just put the button on on the web page which say please send me the the script
__label__False uh we i think the thing that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane thing and uh research point and um i wa thinking
__label__False twenty for the delta
__label__False right
__label__False and the uh aurora htk it wa like twenty
__label__False cuz i m not actually sure just logistically that i can spend you know i do nt wan na charge the time that i have on the project too early before there s enough data to make good use of the time and that s and especially with the student uh for instance this guy who seems
__label__False it wa more than that
__label__False no i you said at sri so i had to add the dot com
__label__False yep
__label__False so it s just uh
__label__False what
__label__False um
__label__False s
__label__False yeah
__label__False so he wa looking he wa looking at the peak value
__label__False like you could have a p
__label__False just do capture the audio on the pda and send the audio over the wireless net
__label__False yeah that s that s
__label__False uhhuh
__label__True i mean i had thought about this before i mean when when when you use a product like dragondictate they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on
__label__False so how many of those thousand were silence silent section
__label__False yes
__label__False right
__label__False i mean you can do that but that s pretty annoying because the cd are so slow
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False infoon ha true or false and location so he want to know something about it and he want to know something he want to know whereitis ha these value
__label__False so let s see
__label__False i think that s a fixed thing but see see my point if you had
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah well y
__label__False oh wow
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False uh it s in after the mel filter bank
__label__False so those are those are major component i think uh for the stationary kind of stuff
__label__False and and and of course
__label__False you could do it about you
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False ma major major mayor
__label__False i ve noticed in the past that when i ve gone through transcription and you know in in order to build lexicon and thing if you um just take all the transcription and separate them into word and then alphabetize them a lot of time just scanning down that list you ll find a lot of inconsistency and mi
__label__False i m tinkering with uh support vector machine something that we learned in class and uh um basically just another method for doing classification
__label__False yeah it s better for high mismatch
__label__False so i did note i i it look like the uh metaphor did nt get in yet
__label__False uh and you had you know you had the multiband thing also and you know there wa issue of that
__label__False yeah there s a
__label__False new new set up
__label__False oh there we go
__label__False that s the shortest meeting we have most of them are double that or so
__label__False zero nine five one two zero eight
__label__False mmm
__label__False or
__label__False i just really doubt that uh any of the state of california meeting would be recordable and then releasable to the general public
__label__False well he wa he s it looked like the probabil at one point he wa looking at the probability he wa getting out at the likelihood he wa getting out of plp versus mel cepstrum and they looked pretty different a i recall
__label__False excuse me
__label__False yeah that s right um
__label__False very nice
__label__False yeah
__label__False but um that s not a frequent a just laughing between speaking so
__label__False on the average it ll probably be three or four year
__label__False so the idea is that this really is you know that s supposed show that s it s really fictive and so on but um
__label__False but the thing is that if different system are getting at good thing um a again within the constraint of the resource if there s something simple that you can do
__label__False we wo nt have enough microphone but
__label__False i i given is the estimate of the pdf of the noise signal when we have a um a statistic of the clean speech and an statistic of the noisy speech
__label__False so transcript three zero one one three zero three zero nine eight five eight
__label__False no no no
__label__False how obtained the lda filter
__label__False and we do nt
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah you could
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False by that look i
__label__False i
__label__False yeah i ll try
__label__False on on um
__label__False but e u
__label__False h he did and then it did nt work and
__label__False um
__label__False and it did slightly worse but it s really a small difference
__label__False uh fair enough
__label__False carol snow who wa confused not me and not jerry
__label__False well if you d rather have this one then it s
__label__False that wa fixed um before i i i i think i i think i understood that pretty thank you for mentioning yeah no tha that
__label__False and so you re gon na be talking beep number yes beep number no
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False at the beginning it wa not surprising to me that you get really the best result on doing it this way i mean in comparison to any type of training on clean data and any type of processing but it wa so u u it it seems to be the best what wh wh what what we can do in this moment is multicondition training
__label__False yeah
__label__False and i told them um if he decides to use multiple example for um the prosody demo to open up separate transcriber
__label__False cuz in both in both both of those case you do nt have the same task
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False uh it s uh five hundred hidden unit and
__label__False the problem with it is just it doe require coding
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh sorry
__label__False damn this project no just kidding
__label__False yeah
__label__False seven four eight beep seven beep eight three two
__label__False htk training testing with different kind of feature and what appears in the uh left column is the network that are used for doing this
__label__False six eight eight eight nine seven eight zero
__label__False always thinking about binding
__label__False but how many construction do could we possibly have node for
__label__False oh you have nt done the whole session this is just twelve minute oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i i wa playing you know with those um uh device that allow you to manipulate object when it s dangerous to get close
__label__False right
__label__False yeah but
__label__False it s a human operator
__label__False yeah so i thought the performance wa actually a little better on female than male
__label__False um not
__label__False you know on boston new york new york rhode island whatever boston
__label__True so who s gon na do that who s gon na do forced alignment
__label__False and then
__label__False i wa like ok we re done
__label__False no but it s this but between the frequency that we are considered for the excitation for the difference and this is the difference
__label__False that s still pretty dang big
__label__False ok so doe that mean that i ca nt use email
__label__False no
__label__False but r our result from other other place yeah
__label__False to right
__label__False six eight seven seven one five zero seven five
__label__False so that would mean like if you were listening to the data that wa recorded on one of those
__label__False so uh so he did he did his phd on dynamic bayesnets uh for for speech recognition he had some continuity built into the model presumably to handle some um inertia in the in the production system and um
__label__False is that is that that including digit
__label__False ok well so long a you have the same baseline then you ll be able to tell
__label__False oh
__label__False at the same time
__label__False you know it depends on the kind of research they re doing but it might be uh it might be really a a pain
__label__False i begin to to study and to analyze the ehn the recorded speech eh the different session to to find and to locate and to mark eh the the different overlapping zone
__label__False but i would think that s what you want to do right
__label__False that s true
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m not sure eh by the moment but it s it s probably that eh a lot of eh eh for example in the overlapping zone on eh in in several eh part of the file where you you can find eh eh eh smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the in the meeting it s probably in in that eh in in those file you you can not find you can not process because eh it s confused with with noise
__label__False there were other people also
__label__False exactly
__label__False noninteractive
__label__False i do nt have the comp mmm
__label__False no that s good that mean i have i h i can spend this week doing it so
__label__False you re kidding
__label__False i think what they do is they do it always online i mean that you just take what you have from the past that you calculate the mean of this and subtract the mean
__label__False brian s kingsbury s work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma right which is what i wa calling the party line which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want we want something more flexible uh i i where people might change their position and there might be you know
__label__False i remember that i ca nt show that
__label__False yeah so basically that wa that s all we discussed about we discussed about good thing to do also uh well generally good stuff to do for the research
__label__False so we we collect we collect both humancomputer and humanhuman data essentially in the same session
__label__False yeah uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False talk to a machine and it break down and then the human come on
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False zero
__label__True i i i worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself whereas um if you did something instead that like um having some manual annotation by uh you know linguistics student this would there d be a limited s set of thing that you could do a a per our discussion with with john before but the thing that you could do like nasality and voicing and a couple other thing you probably could do reasonably well
__label__False that s true
__label__False ok switching o
__label__False i i can do this incorrectly
__label__False great
__label__False well l i i thought it wa a lot more than that
__label__False so it adapts more quickly
__label__False my understanding is the issue is nt really the file server we could always put more disk on it s the backup system
__label__False i also mmhmm
__label__False sorry
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False really do we have to like synchronize
__label__False yeah
__label__False mirjam ha been doing
__label__False mmhmm yeah that s right
__label__False yeah i actually seem to recall srini complaining about something to do with entering probability so this is probably
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False maybe
__label__False that s what i wa saying
__label__False oh that aspect
__label__False sh
__label__False i want to see
__label__False that s where he removed english right
__label__False so you have a basically a goal and it you know say ok well i m gon na try to do the
__label__False yeah
__label__False right so so so for their usage they do nt need anything
__label__False t
__label__False i mean before i thought we d get you know a hundred and fifty percent error or something but if if uh if we re getting thirtyfive forty percent or something u um
__label__False you can find uh problem with with the transcript um you know and go back and fix them but
__label__False yeah it sound like it doe nt it yeah
__label__False i do nt i m not sure but
__label__False yeah
__label__False right now nobody would be there but
__label__False so there s no sequence in that i think i think it s just a
__label__False we have never seen big difference once i thought oh i can
__label__True maybe you you are leaving in in about two week carmen no
__label__False yeah eighty percent
__label__False yeah
__label__False and and
__label__False ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok ok
__label__False i heard it
__label__False reasoning machine
__label__False well no i think
__label__False um
__label__False here ok
__label__False oh that wa another thing i i had assumed that we did nt need their signature that it that an email approval wa sufficient
__label__False you ll be given an opportunity
__label__False yeah i think we have linear interpolation so we have we have one point for one energy for each filter bank which is the energy that s centered on on on the triangle
__label__False we can we can ignore it when we get it back huh
__label__False ok so then you just have some probability over ok over which which of those it is
__label__False but uh i do nt know y what the right thing is to do for that i m not
__label__False well in this case it s a p it s a sort of testing of the wizard rather than of the subject it s uh
__label__False actually yeah it s very close to clean speech training because well because the close microphone and noisy speech testing yeah
__label__False i i may be just um reading this and interpreting it into my head in the way that i ve always viewed thing and that that may or may not be what you guy intended
__label__True file and directory
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False i you mean did you see this in the sri system
__label__False so if we had a
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False is that it hhh
__label__False so i do nt know whether
__label__False but they will um
__label__False let s see
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok i will ok ok
__label__False and transfer function
__label__False and we might wan na do that anyway because it seems like that s being a bottleneck and that s silly it should nt be a bottleneck
__label__False um and he s been doing all the talking but but these he s he s uh
__label__False right it wa fine x added this one
__label__False so um
__label__False uh so we have a whole bunch of digit that we ve read and we have the form and so on um but only a small number of that ha well not a small number only a subset of that ha been transcribed and so we need to decide what we wan na do
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False so
__label__False and then it s just uh edge many of edge
__label__False i agree with that and so my feeling is we should get mike that people like
__label__False um are you worried about being able to identify
__label__False yeah there s there s a
__label__False yeah the floor is lower
__label__False cuz yeah
__label__False the b
__label__False uh
__label__False that s not that bad but it wa l like two percent relative worse on speechdatcar
__label__False y you ca nt do it without i think changing the number of filter but
__label__False that s yeah
__label__False uh well there is basically perhaps a flaw in the in the the stuff because we trained the network
__label__False not just that you want to go from here to here it s that the action is what you intend and this action consists of all com complicated module and image schema and whatever so
__label__False two two two six one six eight one five five
__label__False i do nt know so morgan
__label__False zero eight zero five two six four eight one six
__label__False well
__label__False you can do that if you want
__label__False that s a little bit
__label__False right but
__label__False but yeah
__label__False and this announcement wa in stereo
__label__False mmhmm well one would
__label__False you just wrote this
__label__False sure
__label__False and any type of comment whether it s a spelling or a syntax or readability
__label__False well not all of them but you know
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i m using two second
__label__False no
__label__False um i mean on the one hand um sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there
__label__False mmm
__label__False wait
__label__True i think dan elli or somebody who wa working with him wa going to uh work on that
__label__False oh really ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False but the main thing wa to get them used to the convention and you know the idea of the th th the size of the unit versus how long it take to play it back so these th sort of calibration issue
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yes
__label__False you will be here
__label__False so obviously that s gon na happen
__label__False the only reason i m asking is you re gon na need space to split them up and so i wanted to make sure we had some available for you
__label__False nah
__label__False it s per utterance but it it allows a long a you hypothesize the word in the right segment in the reference it give you credit for that so it doe a it doe a word alignment like you have to do for scoring but it constrains the word to lie within the t the time bin of the reference
__label__False yeah
__label__False i strongly suspect that they have more speaker than we do
__label__False jerry
__label__False what doe this tell u
__label__False o eight eight three seven five five five two o two six seven four o four three three five seven
__label__False so it seems like that would really help you for doing business versus tourist but ok so the the context being um e i do nt know if that question s sort of in general are you
__label__False yeah
__label__False so in fact what we may want are simpler model
__label__False cuz if it s
__label__False right so let s take the simple case where you just had you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there s a there s an echo it come back
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but well we should get to a a nice kind of working state of our set up a quickly a possible
__label__False and um we have a uh uh
__label__False let s see i guess you you actually already said this thing about the uh about the consent form which wa that we now do nt have to
__label__False you really should nt uh te
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh johno is much more pragmatic
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False so they ll be given this map which mean that they wo nt have to like ask the system for in for like high level information about where thing are
__label__False i just meant that e every ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a a bias that is presented right of and
__label__False um
__label__False yeah i mean that s the kind of thing that s the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say this is a project that we ve been working on and here s a demo version of it and stuff like that
__label__False not great
__label__False actually the five thing the closed is also not directly extracted i guess from the uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False a castle
__label__False uhhuh yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False i think it will be interesting to do other thing that are nt dumb
__label__False uh if we we have two yeah
__label__False and then so in the in the um in the nonmismatched clean case your best one wa under mfcc
__label__False basically
__label__False uh
__label__False ha
__label__False ok i think we can
__label__False i do nt know how if any of this wa discussed but how i if it all this is going to interact with whatever general uh other other discourse processing that might be happen i mean
__label__False i i m i m trying to understand why it s it s eighty percent that s an accuracy number i guess right
__label__False right
__label__False it it seems that the vad network doe nt well it doe nt drop uh too many frame because the dele the number of deletion is reasonable
__label__False yes yes i um i m i m gon na do some would you be interested
__label__False one seven six seven three four three zero four
__label__False node
__label__False i think it s an empirical question i think we could find that out i m i m not sure that the beginning had more
__label__False what i
__label__False we do nt have background chewing
__label__False it s a different one
__label__False oh ok
__label__False um not no relation the f the fortyeight hundred bit is for transmission of some feature
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False so um
__label__False i mean
__label__False hhh
__label__False well
__label__False for
__label__False so with net trained on task data
__label__False the basic stuff right
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False that might be a little unfair
__label__False well why do i would nt say fortyhour week no but what i mean is
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah probably yeah
__label__False what fun it is
__label__False and it wa uh it wa fun to some extent but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that i think both ralf and tilman um i know that they enjoyed it here and they r they they liked uh a lot of the stuff they saw here what what we have been thinking about and they re more than willing to to um cooperate by all mean
__label__False and so
__label__False i just did it but it is i did wan na say that um
__label__False and uh and we go we thought oh come on but
__label__False ok
__label__False no and i do nt need to meet with those people
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False alright i think these thing are a lot clearer when you can use font different font there so you know which is which but i i under i understand what you mean now ok
__label__False so i tried it again um and um the result were were better i got intelligible speech back but they still were nt a good a just subtracting the magnitude the log magnitude mean
__label__False so continuing to um extend uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False eight four two eight nine one six four
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False we have to wait for that to fill the whole table but
__label__False yeah he he did nt say he ha nt said anything to me about it
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False this is kind of central
__label__False anyway we ll talk more about it later yeah
__label__False you s you have a better r
__label__False hmm
__label__False meaning really is nt my thing
__label__False there wa a start of some effort on something related to voicing or something is that
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think it should be more yeah
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so it s like
__label__False yeah do it with one of on
__label__False if you say uh if you have a place characteristic and a manner characteristic how do you
__label__False you re a data fiend
__label__False but i am sure that people have done it because it s gon na be a problem a lot of people have
__label__False but yeah the i sh think they should be roughly equivalent um
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False alright we re not crashing
__label__False no uh so the mel cepstrum is the is the is the cepstrum of this this uh spectrum or log spectrum whatever it you you re subtracting in in in power domain or log domain
__label__False just to save time
__label__False yeah thank you
__label__False um
__label__False i thought we were going to get two more of the one
__label__False you can get a list of all the machine that are available to pmake by using the command reginfo minus showattr
__label__False you it ll sort of work but it s not exactly what you would maybe get from recognition you never know
__label__False i ye yeah th u
__label__False what you
__label__False y you have ninety feature
__label__False so they tried to approximate it but it wa it wa spelled gabbl
__label__True that wa my thought i think this is u no i i had nt in intended to we won we wan na i mean they re there s gon na be uh jeff katrin mari and two student so there s five from there
__label__False cover only base case and to make them apply to metaphorical case and metonymic case and all those thing requires this additional mechanism of construal and the punch line is he claimed that if you do this right you can get essentially orthogonality that if you introduce a new construction at at the base level it should com uh interact with all the metonymy and metaphor so that all of the projection of it also should work
__label__False the temporal lda doe in fact include the same so that i think he well by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram i think mean if you construct it this way this this delay would work in that way and then it d be ok
__label__False if we have a choi i ve always wondered how well they would work
__label__False um there because they start off with uh an initial model which is just this global model and then they split it to the individual and so it may be that that s what s happening here i i i have to look it up and see i i do nt exactly remember
__label__False mmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False and then we can uh you know
__label__False yeah some of these thing are captured by yeah um by looking at at the minimum and maximum and whatever you find in the channel and
__label__False right
__label__False we re gon na get an xml document from somewhere
__label__False i do nt know i have nt spoken with him
__label__False oh interesting
__label__False so so you should weight those other condition v very you know really small
__label__False no i changed this to the to the to the loudness thingy with the with the how do you call it i m not sure
__label__False so it might be worth keith you looking at this um
__label__False yeah
__label__False you missed that part
__label__False ok so um
__label__False yeah
__label__False and this is dan with transcript number seven four five six four four five six o six o two eight one two o eight five nine nine three five o three two four
__label__False yeah ok because he there wa some mail r saying that it s may not be stable for linux and all those
__label__False zero five five three two one nine zero
__label__False how to how to calculate it then
__label__False so looking at the data where you know what s the what s what s th what s characteristic i e yeah i think that s that s a good thing
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False no
__label__False not do anything that s really finely tuned but just sort of eh you know you t you i z
__label__False uh just not during that time when it s down but that it should be down for an hour
__label__False um
__label__False oh um uh
__label__False it s not determined
__label__False i think that s correct
__label__False hmm
__label__False like
__label__False oh oh yeah yeah we ve thought about that right right
__label__False i mean for the evaluation yes we ll run a version that ha nt been touched
__label__False who will there be a
__label__False three
__label__False o eight six zero three one zero nine one two one eight one zero zero
__label__False i i ca nt help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed i mean if people have
__label__False right i m sorry i just
__label__False yeah lind susan lindner right the the the syrup spread out that kind of thing
__label__False oh ok
__label__False from what i saw from the earlier result uh i guess last week wa that um if you trained on one language and tested on another say that the result were were relatively poor
__label__False ok so yeah it s just by definition that the individual that the uh so capital x is by definition the same a e to the little x because she s saying that the little x is is the uh is the log
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False um we just how did we do it up again
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__True no but with baumwelch there should nt be an overfitting issue really
__label__False right
__label__False and i think what happens here is
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False everyone ready s reading simultaneous digit three two one
__label__False that would be ideal would be is that they could you know they could actually show that in fact a combination of some sort uh would work even better than what what any of the system had
__label__False so is the only r reason we can make all these smaller bayesnets because we know we can only deal with a finite set of construction
__label__False well it s a it s a big improvement
__label__False just in
__label__False and um this referencing thing however is of temporary nature because sooner or later the wthreec will be finished with their xpath uh um specification and then it s going to be even much nicer then we have real mean of pointing at an individual instantiation of one of our element here and link it to another one and this not only within a document but also via document and and all in a v very easy e homogenous framework
__label__False yeah
__label__False they could nt use cd
__label__False right
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False so
__label__False um so it s exactly the same approach but the feature that the vad neural network use are uh mfcc after noise compensation
__label__False it s just it eh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so in that sense we weight them equally right now
__label__False yeah
__label__False well i mean but the there s so you just have three decision for the final node that would link thes these three node in the net together
__label__False yeah
__label__False probab
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s trained on a lot of different thing um
__label__False but they re shown like on a screen it s a i mean so would the generator like the english language sentence of it is these are the follow you know the following film are being shown or something like that
__label__False yeah so it s four
__label__False if that s ok
__label__False i tried to do some experiment of recognition with that and only have result with with the mlp with the three output
__label__False um
__label__False strange but
__label__False hmm
__label__False b but i
__label__False a third thing is that um
__label__False yeah i mean it s just you know the microphone is intended for certain adjustment
__label__False yeah yeah so
__label__False yeah
__label__False but i do nt think we need to do that in this meeting
__label__False but what i meant is
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh
__label__False so we might yeah at least want to retrain on these alignment which should be better because they come from closetalking microphone
__label__False uh i m not considering eh the the ehm eh the fact of eh eh for example what did you say
__label__False well this wa this wa the question so so they were saying they were not going to and i said well that s silly if if we re gon na try to do it for a corpus there might be people who are interested in acoustic
__label__False and that s all i have to say
__label__False you just have to have the thing running before you open your laptop
__label__False i remember when i wa when i i i i used uh um a prominent laboratory s uh uh speech recognizer about uh
__label__False yeah
__label__True we can m undoubtedly get ami uh to give a talk at uh eml or something like that while he s in in uh
__label__False and that s alright because at at a hundred sample that s already pretty far out
__label__False there re two different thing you do one is you design and the other is you learn
__label__False what is that
__label__False if you do nt say that then people think oh they did that and they threw that but that doe nt represent what would happen in the real world
__label__False yeah
__label__False or just keep the lock on it
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s true it just seems like i if something l simple like that can be tweaked and the quality go you know uh dramatically up then it might be worth doing
__label__False no
__label__False so the uh
__label__False yeah i mean i guess the
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False task data
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh too bad i kinda like it
__label__False command line
__label__False yeah that s true that s true
__label__False it s it s um it s some money that we can use
__label__False right
__label__False so
__label__False they should be more close
__label__False yeah but
__label__False right
__label__False it wa in the order of thirty millisecond or
__label__False seven six nine eight eight seven nine nine two five
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s in
__label__False at the n at the center of the filter
__label__False well it would have t yeah it would have to be um you know either obviously a s sounding synthesized uh little
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False well we do because of privacy we ca nt just make it openly available on the web
__label__False oh right oh that s
__label__False yeah maybe we can include that also in our second uh data run we c we can show people picture of object and then have then ask the system about the object and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth
__label__False i tell you i say i say uhhuh a lot while people are talking to each other
__label__False twenty percent relative gain
__label__False um
__label__False is he how long is he gone for
__label__False yeah
__label__False that sound like a spy code
__label__False yeah
__label__False um it it doe ar modeling and so it look at a section it run an ar model to sort of r w to whiten it and then quantizes the residual with a nice with the three bit it can get away with something like that
__label__False ok
__label__False well it
__label__False you know
__label__False the yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so what i what is going on right now what s right you ve got net retraining
__label__False and it doe the same syntax and everything eh like matlab or
__label__False uh we can consider it but i mean the other thing is since we ve been spending so much time thinking about overlap is is maybe get a much more detailed analysis of the overlap
__label__False are we on the right track with with the the choice of our acoustic event
__label__False uh uh time the well this is natural log and maybe it ha something to do with the fact that this is
__label__False anyway enough of that let s talk about your thesis proposal
__label__False it just queue it up and and when it s available it will copy it
__label__False that wa it huh ok
__label__False no it did nt but
__label__False so i think it s gon na be a problem to get people regularly
__label__False this is the filter bank in the frequency domain that start at sixtyfour yeah
__label__True what s september sixth
__label__False eh with eh a beginning mark and the ending mark
__label__False but there is this this is this still this problem of weight when when you combine error rate it tends to give more importance to the difficult case and some people think that well they have different um opinion about this
__label__False and so remind me the multilingual stuff is just the broad data right
__label__False um
__label__False that but it wa nt wa
__label__False and the aurora folk here will will definitely get something in on aurora so
__label__False anyway it s colloquial an and and uh it s it s interesting to hear that that someone coming from a different direction it s it sound the way it sound to you
__label__False yeah right have you hav y h had this
__label__False yeah
__label__False so would that be similar to like doing the smoothing then over time or
__label__False ben then ben
__label__False whether they discus the admission fee so we looked at the data and in a lot of data people were saying thing like can i get to this place what is the admission fee so that s like a huge uh clue that they re trying to enter the place rather than uh to tango or vista so
__label__False yeah
__label__False wow so this is almost ten percent
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i i hire i ve hired two extra people already expect to hire two more
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False yeah
__label__False just
__label__False ok
__label__False and you laughed at me too f the first time i said that
__label__False oh it s just one net
__label__False but run into doe
__label__False o six two zero six eight one nine eight two nine two three four six one o six o five nine
__label__False and this sort of smooth it for very small energy
__label__False from and so if you re splitting thing up into utterance so for instance in a dialogue system where you re gon na be asking uh you know th for some information there s some initial th something and you know the first time out you you might have some general average but you you d you do nt have very much information yet
__label__True i i also s would suggest not to d spend two week in in in changing the the javabayes code i i will send you a pointer to a java applet that doe that it s sort of a fisheye you you have a node and you click on it and it show you all the connection and then if you click on something else that move away that go into the middle
__label__False yeah cuz the time constant of the online normalization is pretty long compared to the delta window so
__label__False hmm
__label__False when you say the whole group you mean the four of u and keith
__label__False um
__label__False yeah but yeah
__label__False ibm to do word level transcription not speech event transcription
__label__False mmm
__label__False is that power spectrum no is that power spectrum is it
__label__False it it s going to be imperfect you re not gon na get it perfect
__label__False hmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False it sometimes actually depends on what feature you re using
__label__False now the e but for some reason the endpointapproach get a really high score too
__label__False yeah people will get
__label__False ah
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh right right right right that s great yeah i i shweta mentioned that although she said it s a secret
__label__False seven three six two eight five nine four eight one
__label__False yeah got them
__label__False but that s that s not a that s a cheating experiment so
__label__False oh so you already have that ok
__label__False yeah and
__label__False i mean you know because cuz we ve got data on user right and then we d have to back it all up and copy it back on again
__label__False so he doe h he doe nt need help from this group on the technical aspect or if he doe uh we ll do that separately but in term of what are the decision and stuff like that that s something that we all have to work out
__label__False thank you
__label__False so uh i actually picked th
__label__False yeah cuz i thought i let you know about that yeah
__label__False well i do nt know how we can
__label__False yeah
__label__False day after tomorrow yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False um i do nt know i m surprised because
__label__False ok
__label__False everybody like action
__label__False no we grabbed most of it like we grabbed the linear fitting stuff we did all the alignment and all the matching and stuff but the actual coding of the the math wa done somewhere else
__label__False we have first that for example x is equal uh well
__label__False so i i do i m i m not
__label__False well since you seem to feel heart uh strongest about it would you like to do the first pas
__label__False yeah
__label__False you know burst also is nt burst is used also
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i guess it s the power spectrum of noisy speech yeah and
__label__False um and so i have two recursion which are controlled by the um probability of the voice activity detector
__label__False so this is one thing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False on one possible
__label__False so um
__label__False yeah so the alignment might be wrong then on channel one right
__label__False it s just a it s just a word we train it like any other word yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False o o two one six four one zero zero seven zero four
__label__False so what is it and then you go back to the intuition that well you do nt really get the excitation but you get something related to it
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm it maybe it mean we had nothing to say about the sourcepathgoal
__label__False oh ok
__label__False it s it s a good eh work but eh i think we need eh eh more information
__label__False hmm
__label__False please
__label__False we had exactly that on our list of possible way thing so we uh i even made a sort of a silly thing how that could work how you control you are here you you want to know how to get someplace and this is the place and it s a museum and you want to do some and and and there s a person looking at picture
__label__False et h and then there s one the french speaking one in lausanne
__label__False right
__label__False ha door
__label__False it s pretty sad yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah so i wa thinking right now it s sort of this exploratory stuff where you you look at the data you use some primitive measure and get a feeling for what the scatter plot look like and and and uh and meanwhile we collect and it s more like yeah three month from now or six month from now you can you can do a lot of other thing
__label__False yeah i wa gon na say like
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False and uh so in principle you could start up with something that wa kind of rough
__label__False um and he did nt think they had um
__label__False believe it or not we have all the bottom one here
__label__False yes
__label__False yeah so so what they re doing here is i if you look down at the block diagram um they estimate they get a they get an estimate of whether it s speech or silence and then they have a median filter of it
__label__False uhhuh ok
__label__False oh
__label__False but
__label__False did jerry talk to you about maybe using our class the student in the undergrad class that he s teaching e
__label__False so the thinking behind that wa we have the feature that we ve drawn from the communication of some
__label__False which would you know cause it to perform ok but uh you know the the model would be all messed up so i wa going through and just doublechecking that kind of think first to see if there wa just some kind of obvious bug in the way that i wa computing the feature
__label__False uh so there is this combination yeah working on combination obviously
__label__False so i wan na play with that a little bit more
__label__False yeah that s that s at
__label__False i
__label__False oh i see ok
__label__False proceed
__label__False i mean
__label__False right for the full band
__label__False to the world
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean in a way this is a lot of good feature in java it s cra ha a gui and it s uh
__label__False exactly yeah and then maybe there are some discourse act if they happened before um it s more for um a cue that the person actually want to get somewhere else and that you are in a in a in a route um sort of proceeding past these thing so this would be just something that where you want to pas it hmm
__label__False uh
__label__False uh just what we were talking about before which is that i ported a blass library to absinthe and then got got it working with fastforward and got a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processor time the clock cycle so that s pretty good
__label__False um if you do a second term doe it get too complicated cuz of the nonlinearity
__label__False so do i yeah
__label__False somebody could do you know uh check out uh the multithreading library and
__label__False they are they re putting eh so in curly bracket they put inhale or breath
__label__False sure
__label__False and something different in some fundamental way and so the kind of thing that that she wa talking about before wa looking at something uh ab um something uh about the difference between the the uh um log fft uh log power uh and the log magnitude uh ff spectrum uh and the um uh filter bank
__label__False yep
__label__False so
__label__False um
__label__False well just talk to him about it
__label__False yeah
__label__False so you could you could base it on your estimation of the signaltonoise ratio on your actual
__label__False but i told them if if there s an obvious speech error uh like i said in one thing and i gave my my example like i said microfon in instead of microphone
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah so the fiftyeight is like the be some fiftysix point yeah that s true
__label__False who who are we buying these from that d be a
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False run what on those
__label__True uh reorganization status
__label__False so uh sunil will be in oregon uh stephane and i will be in denmark
__label__False that sample wa released only yesterday or the day before right
__label__False ok
__label__False so s it s it it s a very big deal i i in this framework and the thesis proposal a it stand doe nt um i do nt think say that a clearly a it could
__label__False i mean one of the thing about i mean the macrophone data um i think you know it wa recorded over many different telephone
__label__False uh regardless of of of the input wh regardle
__label__False it could nt be twelve
__label__False you have the same number of parameter in the neural net you have nt increased the size of the neural net and maybe there s just just not enough complexity to it to represent the variab increased variability in the in the training set
__label__False yeah but we can be sure that a or we can be er not not totally sure but we can be somehow sure that there is nothing not no speech between those so it it
__label__False but the i mean the th th it doe nt work
__label__False yeah but it in that sense it doe nt make in that case uh it doe nt really make sense to read them out loud if you re displaying them
__label__False johno where are you
__label__False and um then it would it would uh be something to to discus in the meeting
__label__False i mean my my preference in term of like looking at the data is to see it in this kind of musical score format
__label__False i mean
__label__False fifteen p
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False or or or or will it just um uh is it change
__label__False what do you need need to buy a ticket you know and it it s fifty step huh just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter you know and and maybe that s helpful to look at it to look at those
__label__False yeah you did you adjust the the utterance time um for each channel
__label__False well it if he you have to put the data on a on a nonbackedup disk to begin with
__label__False mmm yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False it must be in the high hundred of them at least
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False xray database
__label__False just think of it a a wheel in german
__label__False yeah
__label__False um i do nt know they re in in non in sort of more traditional ai kind of plan recognition thing you sort of have you know some idea at each turn of agent doing something
__label__False somebody else should run this
__label__False and here we can multiply by x
__label__False right right
__label__False yeah great
__label__False timit
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah but then you ll have the degradation of of uh whatever you do uh added onto that but maybe yeah maybe if you get something that sound that that s doe a pretty job at that
__label__True i think maybe talk to him first in person that s what i would think
__label__False from the utterance
__label__False the the so the context is a switch between tourist or nontourist or also unknown
__label__False um but yeah we should try to use what you have i did rerun recognition on your new version of
__label__False it s it s rad yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False alright
__label__False well they would have to have a mark
__label__False yep
__label__False and um i i do have some good news for the natural language generation however and the good news is i guess it s done
__label__False but well it s just
__label__False that will be one one thing we could do
__label__False oh
__label__False wizardess
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean it w
__label__True you should do both and and i i think that this still make i still think this make sense a a baseline
__label__False because i think that would be cheaper than having our people do it but do it with the same process with these beep file
__label__False and actually an an alternative to even doing that level of transcription would be to have a transcriber listen and and m you know maybe just
__label__False so um
__label__False i mean how are they doing it
__label__False yeah yeah i do nt know i m sorry but
__label__False what that mean is once we have uh everything running on linux we can also use a li eh
__label__False cuz it s all
__label__False so it could reduce the dependence on the amplitude and so on yeah
__label__False uh another wireless system
__label__False we did nt do this because we felt that there d
__label__False so we re gon na set up feature along the line of where they want to go and what they ve said previously and whatnot and then we have the mean that they should use right but the middle thing we were thinking along the line of maybe trying to figure out like the concept of whether they re a tourist or whether they re running an errand or something like that along those line
__label__False yeah so this might be a conflict for him
__label__False so in the future
__label__False yeah i do nt know if he s before it might even be in a week
__label__False right
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False five six six two zero zero two nine six
__label__False i probably been affect no i th i think i ve been affected by too many conversation where we were talking about lawyer and talking about and concern about oh gee is somebody going to say something bad and so on
__label__False no no there a a actually by i think my question is simpler than that um is ok so you have an spg action and and it ha three different um uh aspect um because you can either enter a building or view it or or approach it and touch it or something
__label__False yeah actually it s changed to a synthesis for for the first part now yeah
__label__False s b
__label__False uh dave doe have this stuff that is helping on digit and you know and so with then it d be you know just throw that in and see
__label__False twentyseven broad class
__label__False for the clean training u
__label__False we can write up uh an element and for each of the situation node that we observed in the bayesnet
__label__False there re five now it can hold eight
__label__False i ca nt put this over my ear
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False i can send yet
__label__False they just have to make sure that it is available to them
__label__False oh so you re just saying put them on cd for normal access
__label__False i m h i m happy that they re recording that
__label__False transcript l dash three zero one
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah that way we do nt we ca nt listen to it on this machine
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False interesting
__label__False and with a dict different dictionary with a considerably different dictionary which wa much le detailed and much le wellsuited
__label__False yeah but all those thing without question mark are also binary right
__label__False yeah well yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False because you re not gon na get anymore information out of the action a a you find it there in the domain object
__label__False i m just
__label__False yeah
__label__False it
__label__False in the sense that you know if it s tom the house of tom cruise you know it s enterable but you may not enter it
__label__False well
__label__False it s somewha it s boggling me
__label__False uh probably the day after they leave but we ll have to we ll have to stop it the day before we leave
__label__False right
__label__False right
__label__False i do nt want to make people selfconscious stop breathing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we have a kernel on popcorn too
__label__False like i i
__label__False oh wow
__label__False and if you add too much noise it get worse also and it seems that right now this this is c a constant that doe not depend on on anything that you can learn from the utterance it s just a constant noise addition
__label__False well in this case it will hold the
__label__False ie a rich action description on that level
__label__False hmm
__label__False i think it doe suggest that it s not so much uh uh cross language a cross type of speech
__label__False yes
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False it doe timeconstrained wordalignment
__label__False so um i i think m it only took something like uh three or four hour to do the full training a opposed to wh what sixteen hour or something like that
__label__False but
__label__False uhhuh i i i think
__label__False uh
__label__False but mmhmm
__label__False we ll have to wait till we get
__label__False who doe nt like to be a
__label__False yeah
__label__False great idea yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False it really is nobody believed th th that
__label__False whereas this web interface i just get email it s all formatted it s all ready to go and i can just insert it
__label__False yeah
__label__False um and you could experiment with cutting various piece of these back a bit but
__label__False but yeah you re right prob a part of it is just the distance
__label__False o eight three o o eight three four eight one
__label__False right
__label__False there s lot of little difference so
__label__False you can back everything out
__label__False you really do have to sort of r
__label__False yeah
__label__True and hynek when i wa told him about this he had an interesting point and that wa th um the the final model that they end up training up have
__label__False hey you ve done this before have nt you
__label__False i m i m i m i thought i i thought about it with one of my background process and i uh it s uh it s uh it s fine to do the email
__label__False like the day before you leave or something
__label__False and and i do nt think it s possible really to do this fulltime but that what it show is motivation to do a many hour a possible
__label__False i mean th
__label__False um
__label__False oh yeah how di how d exactly did uh that paper lead to antilock brake
__label__False right cuz you cuz you up here you have the a plus b
__label__False that all you want
__label__False monehundred
__label__False but why ca nt you use the combination of the closetalking mike time aligned
__label__False well
__label__False and the lda introduces delay and b what he s suggesting this here is a parallel path so that it doe nt introduce uh any more delay
__label__False if that doe nt work it s not a problem we we need to solve right now
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False park behind the car because to follow the car is defined a it face you
__label__False i guess
__label__False one of the thing that i did notice wa that the um log likelihood coming out of the log recognizer from the plp data were much lower much smaller than for the mel cepstral stuff and that the average amount of pruning that wa happening wa therefore a little bit higher for the plp feature
__label__False so for free recognition this the lower pruning value is better you
__label__False right yeah i wa mostly trying to think ok if you start a project within say a month you know how much data do you have to work with and you you wan na s you wan na sort of fr freeze your your data for awhile so um right now and we do nt have the transcript back yet from ibm right
__label__False is there a
__label__False ok so our initial idea wa not very satisfying because uh our initial idea wa basically all the feature pointing to the output node
__label__False so already again this week huh
__label__False and it might be helpful to them in term of d act
__label__False that s why you actually need the text in order to force you to try to match something that give you a model to match against
__label__False yeah
__label__False yes it is mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False all success
__label__False and so and i i k it doe correspond to a realistic situation in the sense that um people might really be trying to uh call out telephone number or some or something like that in in their car and they re trying to connect to something
__label__False you re playing
__label__False might be between uh shared uh shared variance or something or
__label__False three zero three three zero four four five one six zero fi six
__label__True ok so then i ll go back and look at the one on the list that
__label__False andreas
__label__False that s a lot of overlap yeah for fortyfive minute
__label__False i have one question so are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript because i i do think that there s a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the
__label__False oh not too much
__label__False something about
__label__True wan na talk a little bit about what we were talking about this morning just briefly or
__label__False uh oops
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh you can do that
__label__False ha that s interesting i did nt hear that
__label__False yeah still poor
__label__False functionoff
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you start off with that and the statistical system then aligns thing and eventually you get something that doe nt really look too bad
__label__False um you know like um error rate go from i do nt know in very noisy environment like from uh uh
__label__False by baseline here i meant uh using the task specific data
__label__False so i think that that s gon na also eh you know speed the efficiency of this part of the process
__label__False mmm
__label__False ok we have lot of them
__label__False what kind of filter is that
__label__False ok yeah i m actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of u student were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer so
__label__False yeah
__label__False cuz they have uh already frozen those in i insertion penalty and all those stuff is what i feel because they have this document explaining the recognizer
__label__False so um let me just say a couple thing that i wa i wa gon na bring up uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False um and then secondly we had you may remember um the problem with the rephrasing that subject always rephrase sort of the task that uh we gave them and so we had a meeting on friday talking about how to avoid that and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the the subject m to really have intention and sort of to act upon those and um there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job because it it s getting more complicated so if you know anyone interested in in what i m about to describe tell that person to to write a mail to me or jerry soon fast
__label__False yeah
__label__False some people wanted to use hundred of parameter and and that bothered some other people u and so they just chose that i i i think it s kind of r arbitrary too but but that s that s kind of what wa chosen i i remembered what i wa going to say what i wa going to say is that um maybe maybe with the noise removal uh these thing are now more correlated
__label__False alright
__label__False because
__label__False um where either you have um acoustic feature at the same or or just uh the acoustic waveform s being recorded for frame and then at each frame you have a measurement of of the different position of um uh articulator
__label__False transcript number two seven seven one two seven nine zero nine o nine eight nine zero one five zero one two two eight eight four five two five o o three eight two four five six zero zero eight eight one nine five six six
__label__False you did when
__label__False i mean i do nt know how you get them into the vocabulary but it would seem
__label__False i mean i well and actually also the lawyer saying that um we should nt really have them have the people believing that they will be cleared by our check you know
__label__False yeah
__label__False but
__label__False mmhmm ok
__label__False oh ok
__label__False d
__label__False right right
__label__False hopefully
__label__False we re not saying that the data is cheating data we re saying th we are cheating by using this data
__label__False pretty straightforward
__label__False yeah i do nt know if we wan na use that a the
__label__False and uh then uh look at it more from the aspect of modeling
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False for which we thank you by the way i know you were you were doing that but anyway
__label__False yeah
__label__False but
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__True well you can try each one on a crossvalidation set ca nt you
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah the that wa my idea i mean if if it ha if it is not the same labeling which is taking the space
__label__False mmm
__label__False and so the i the idea of the manual marking wa to say ok this i you know it s it s really here
__label__False uh that s it i think mmm
__label__False jose
__label__False right
__label__False w uh w
__label__False dan s work where he he trained a network not on phoneme target but on the hmm state target
__label__False you you mean for noise cancelling or
__label__False and
__label__False and
__label__False down
__label__False hello
__label__False they both
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no of course i expect you to find more overlap than than jane because you re looking at it at a much more detailed level
__label__False yeah the the log energy the after the clean cleaning up
__label__False if we really orient it towards that extreme case make it really easy we re gon na end up encouraging a headache
__label__False there were other c other people also who did nt ha fill out the speaker form in addition to the nsa yeah
__label__False there you know this
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah it s a ritual
__label__False hmm
__label__False is she ok
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yeah i do nt know
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False hmm mmm
__label__False yeah it is at the moment
__label__False oh i do nt
__label__False and uh how many more parameter we can afford to have in term of the uh computational limit
__label__False but i think liz is saying why not get it out of the transcript
__label__False um
__label__False and we know that the intention is to enter because we know that the person want to buy a cuckoo clock
__label__False wait a minute i what doe that mean the variance of the spectrum of excitation
__label__False once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r larger research community there again you will be allowed to indicate any section that you d prefer to have excised from the database and they will m be removed both from the transcript and the recording
__label__False that s what we were discussing
__label__False the size of the landmark
__label__False hmm
__label__False see we so those are schema exist because in case we need extra information instead of just making it an attribute and which which is just one thing we we decided to make it s own entity so that we could explode it out later on in case there is some structure that that we need to exploit
__label__False so that s uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False actually both of them
__label__False so
__label__False i do nt know about that cuz that would suggest that i mean
__label__False no they can only display one but they can listen to different one
__label__False and let me ask y and i got ta ask you one thing about that so um if they laugh between two word you you d get it in between the two word but if they laugh across three or four word you you get it after those four word doe that matter
__label__False it s not part of a vad system that you re doing
__label__False yeah because thi th they re signing here that they re agreeing to the paragraph which say
__label__False i do nt know if you have some sample of faster or slower speech but it might make a difference i do nt know
__label__False do you mean within the sourcepathgoal action those three
__label__False if you had ten filter then you would be throwing away a lot at the two end
__label__False ok
__label__False you re talking about a a preprocessing step right morgan
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh ok
__label__False are you making any use uh you were you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed
__label__False hmm
__label__False yes
__label__False sorceress i think wizard uh by by popular vote um
__label__False you added a bunch of node for
__label__False and this we ve not uh worked on this yet
__label__False cuz no we ve only no i mean we ve only got four gigabyte and that
__label__False and and all i said wa oh just cycle through with alt tab because that s the standard way of doing it in window
__label__False wel
__label__False twenty percent further
__label__False so so if you use other feature then y but it s just a question of what is your baseline
__label__False ok
__label__False bell digit
__label__False and so bhaskara tracked that down the answer seems to be uh no no one ha done it but yes it s a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that s what you set out to do
__label__False right
__label__False right so in the hybrid system we could train the net with a laughter phone and a breath sound phone
__label__False there were there d be other thing besides just the admission fee but you know we did nt have
__label__False and that actually should nt be too slow uh because it s much lower resolution than a full waveform
__label__False yeah
__label__False something i asked
__label__False and once we have finished it
__label__False how do you pronou
__label__False and here we have somewhat better than that than the danish and somewhat worse than that on the german but i mean it sound like uh one way or another the method that we re doing can reduce the error rate from from mel cepstrum down by you know a fourth of them to uh a half of them
__label__False so that wa yeah so that wa i interesting result so like i said the frontend guy are very much interested in in this is a a well and
__label__False with lapel mike or something
__label__False well what s your what s your thought about what to do next with it
__label__False uh ppp i do nt know you have question about that or suggestion
__label__False alright
__label__False and uh
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False but a a i wa saying people do get probability from these thing and and uh we were just trying to remember how they do but people have used it for speech recognition and they have gotten probability so they have some conversion from these distance to probability
__label__False i knew you d like that
__label__False wow that would be neat
__label__False wow
__label__False yeah
__label__False totally weird stuff
__label__False ok
__label__False wednesday s much better for me yeah
__label__False do i i hear you you did nt
__label__False yeah
__label__False and also he s he s he s got at least one woman
__label__False so but this is the long run
__label__False that s oh
__label__False chuck wa saying there wa more than that
__label__False it s not clear yet what we re gon na use for training uh
__label__False right it doe nt work
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah we we have a big list
__label__False good
__label__False right
__label__False and i tried both mean adaptation and mean and variance and the variance added another or subtracted another point one percent so it s um that s the number there point six i believe is what you get with both uh mean and variance adaptation
__label__False um i did nt use the the scheme that s currently in the proposal because i do nt want to
__label__False is one is you one of you gon na be the subject like are you
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False where he s s this is not a labeling per se
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False that s how we have it currently set up but it could be you know based upon hour or dis we could discrete it de descretize it
__label__False i think listening to this is gon na be like watching somebody s home movie
__label__False yeah
__label__False le
__label__False and we can put that this is equal to the estimated value of e minus a function that conditional to e to the t to the noise signal well this is this function is the the term after develop this the term that we we take
__label__False dave is nt here but he wa going to start working on some thing with the digit
__label__True should i call his office and see
__label__False oh oh sorry uh it s italian tidigits
__label__False copy
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah sometimes thing belong and
__label__False they d
__label__False so we would put write a letter in the category uh that in which it had it w had uh schema u
__label__False the
__label__False ok what do we do with the stuff on top
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and the previous result eightysix and so on are with our feature straight to htk so what we see that is there is that um uh the way we were doing this wa not correct but still the network are very good
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh they do w w and we talked to them about recording some more and we re going to uh we ve started having a morning meeting today uh i starting a w a week or two ago on the uh frontend issue and we re recording those uh there s a network service and application group here who s agreed to have their meeting recorded and we re gon na start recording them they re they meet on tuesday we re gon na start recording them next week
__label__False w we want we want we want it synchronized
__label__False pastry oh ba oh the bak bakery example i see
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False no whenever you load a new meeting or a new transcript right
__label__False yeah that will reduce the variance that ll help but maybe if you doe do it before you get le of these funnylooking thing he s drawing
__label__False i mean no no mixture but just
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean like if we were to choose i do nt know if i were to choose between one or the other i d rather have it played
__label__False but i think for for sort of dyedinthewool speech people um i think that icslp and eurospeech are much more targeted
__label__False yeah
__label__False there there is another difference is that the noise the noise are different well
__label__False sure
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i
__label__False people have the inverse problem with my name
__label__False mmhmm mmm yeah it s linear
__label__False so i d like to for the summer turn into science mode
__label__False well no no no no
__label__False can i i i just
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False zero zero nine two seven six six one eight five
__label__False up one
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m mostly looking at child language which you know will have some overlap but not total with the kind of thing that you guy are getting so you showed some in this here before and maybe you ve posted it before but where would i look if i want to see
__label__False so
__label__False but um but he ha nt had time
__label__False ok and you re taking it out for now or
__label__False um
__label__False um well
__label__False so i just cut it out
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False basically
__label__False it s better for high mismatch right
__label__False but it s also is
__label__False three week
__label__False yeah
__label__False and how much we build and and so forth
__label__False they re on cd but they re not tha that s not the only source they have them on disk
__label__False oh
__label__False we need to do that it s on a list of thing to do i keep on hoping that they re gon na get done but they do nt
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s running it shou we should have the result today during the afternoon but
__label__False ah i m sorry
__label__False oh i know what i wa gon na say
__label__False right so they ll have a little bit more natural interaction
__label__False that look good
__label__False uh this lda is different from the lda that you are talking about the lda that you saying is like you take a block of feature like nine frame or something and then do an lda on it and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twentyfour or something like that
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i i mean it s kind of
__label__False well
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False i mean it s it s it s always the same thing right i mean you could you could say well let we now think that laughter should have three sub sub subunit in the the three state uh different state and then you would have three i mean you know eh eh it s u
__label__False and that wa that s my strategy for handling a lot of these thing in term of thing that need to be glossed i did nt get to that point but
__label__False yeah when you listen to it uh the pzm and the pda yeah th the pda ha higher sound floor but not by a lot it s really pretty uh pretty much the same
__label__False i guess it wa
__label__False cuz it sound like it sort of devalues the the um all other approach which is to to put those distinction in
__label__False uh
__label__False since currently the feacalc program doe nt allow me to change the filter shape independently of the scale
__label__False i think that would be a good thing to start with
__label__False mmm
__label__False um i have no idea which one i m i m on oh one oh i m number one
__label__False touching
__label__False in the ca any piece of language we would nt be able to answer it with this system b if we just h
__label__False mmm
__label__False i did nt just say that no
__label__False yeah i
__label__False yeah exactly and just keep those thing separate and and um dan elli s hack already allows them to be able to display different waveform to clarify overlap and thing so that s already
__label__False you on friday or s on saturday or
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False we certainly would nt wan na do it with everything
__label__False well it say since you re taking a natural log it say that when when you get down to essentially zero energy this is gon na be the natural log of one which is zero
__label__False data
__label__False yeah
__label__False cool
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False that s that s quite nice
__label__False it mean
__label__False right yeah yeah so so ok
__label__False so um we have nt tried that yet on the meeting uh but hopefully it ll help there too
__label__False then you do two iteration of of of context dependent phoneticallytied mixture
__label__False but um for the development set our best result wa a little bit short of fifty percent
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we re discussing this
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah exactly
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False only if they want it
__label__False maybe part of it
__label__False eight
__label__False no i think we should have uh exponentially more middle node than feature we ve extracted
__label__False so there two hundred dollar is is moderate for getting into a discotheque
__label__False well they they have s they have the close talking microphone for each of u so yeah there s separate channel
__label__False park in front of the car a you come beh you drive behind the car
__label__False no
__label__False right
__label__False visit do some sightseeing blahblahblahblahblah sort of analogous to what fey ha started in in in compiling compiling here and already she ha already gone to the trouble of of anchoring it with specific um o um entity and real world place you will find in heidelberg
__label__False that s right
__label__False mmm
__label__False are you assuming that or not like is that to be
__label__False no from from my point of view your shoe is left of the chair
__label__False right what is it that you re supposed to do better than and so having the baseline be the mfcc s mean that people could choose to pour their ener their effort into trying to do a really good vad or tryi
__label__False so
__label__False um
__label__False nuh
__label__False location hotel car restroom
__label__False yeah six month is hard i think a year is a lot better
__label__False transcript l dash four one
__label__False oh that s right
__label__False ok we re going
__label__False right
__label__False so you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff be it lda or neural net that you are training to discriminate between category in one space but what you re really gon na be g getting is is something else
__label__False but
__label__False triangular weighting
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False in other word we re we re not gon na attempt to build uh it do the real work of building a portable device that s little that is doing all the computation we wan na do for the recognition and the farfield mike uh compensation and all that stuff so we re gon na do all that on this powerful board and uh have some wireless connection to it and then the question is what is what doe it look like doe it look like something that you you hold like this or do we make a big deal out of it that you hold it arm at arm s length th so that you can see some display or uh do we have one of these you know i do nt know
__label__False nice wall which we can look up because i mean if you re gon na get real close to a building in the tango mode right there s got ta be a reason for it
__label__False right but it it could be something else suppose you did nt have anything like that then in that case if you have two net
__label__False uh sorry
__label__False or or even or even there wa a a line you know about how
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False eight nine six zero three eight six five
__label__False aha
__label__False there s another aspect to this which maybe is part of why this is bothering me
__label__False and then just use that machine to hook up to the tape
__label__False right and so so you can you can argue about maybe that wa nt the right thing to do but you know they they they had something specific
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False speech researcher
__label__False hmm
__label__False specially
__label__False uh
__label__False then the other issue related to that is data release if we wan na show this in public it should be releas so i uh have nt gotten any other reply from the original email asking for approval so i sent out another set this morning
__label__False twenty for delta
__label__False but we can try
__label__False so so far we have
__label__False yeah
__label__False are they working fulltime now or
__label__False yes
__label__False who well we re s talking about a fairly limited group are are is it a small enough group that they would could just have account doe that solve anything
__label__False you con you conditioned me with your first sentence and so i thought why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose uh oh uh
__label__False appreciate it
__label__False actually i
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False um no that s what that s what we re gon na do next a soon a i finish this other thing so
__label__False yeah right i ve got the headset on after all
__label__False ok sorry
__label__False but then that constraint of sort of uh proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general
__label__False and so um uh with some constraint
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and they would nt look pretty
__label__False what
__label__False so i think uh chuck had a good explanation for it which i liked which is these they re listening to it and so they write something down and let s say they miss it they rewind
__label__False ah ok
__label__True so what s economics the fallacy
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m not gon na put in the figure from liz but i thought it would interesting to uh um point out that it s basically the same
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False s so
__label__False if it s too noisy and if there s something we can buy again for you know moderate amount of price even if it take a couple box or something maybe we should just do it
__label__False um
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False it seems like too many too much coming and going
__label__False i i pretend to to continuing out to spain eh during the the following month eh because i have eh another idea but eh i have nt enough time to to with six month it s not enough to to to research eh and e i i mean if eh the topic is eh so difficult uh in my opinion there is nt
__label__False oh
__label__False alright
__label__False maybe
__label__False well i mean hhh
__label__False but he s but what he but what he s not training up uh what he doe nt depend on a truth is um
__label__False oh so
__label__False yeah
__label__False there will probably be yeah one single kl to transform everything or uh per
__label__False um so at a meeting that wa nt transcribed we worked up a a typology
__label__False yeah see one thing that s a little bit um
__label__False well and they re already they re these thing are already recorded we do nt have to ask them to even and i m not sure wh how they record it but they must record from individual
__label__False i missed my turn
__label__False before the twentyninth ok
__label__False and so um basically they re trying to find stretch
__label__False that s true
__label__False oh could you close the door maybe yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False reading transcript l dash five six
__label__False i guess the the the issue i wa the general issue i wa bringing up wa that if you re have a moving moving window uh a wa a a set of weight time thing that uh move along shift along in time that you have in fact a linear time invariant filter
__label__True is this related to the issue that you brought up a couple of meeting ago with the the musical tone and
__label__False i think that s the key thing and then if we can feed it different feature then we can try all the different thing that we re trying there
__label__False and that should be fairly
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well i do nt
__label__False so
__label__False about
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False oh i made a
__label__False mmhmm or it wa a it wa around one yeah
__label__False oh so i thought that wa directly given by the context switch
__label__False yeah
__label__False nine six four
__label__False that s another way of doing it
__label__False right
__label__False i ha i have an extra point which is the naturalness issue
__label__False right
__label__False and
__label__False yeah
__label__False i ve done that kind of thing
__label__False oh ok there s a web site and then you could like um figure out what the cate ok
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i have
__label__False i bet it is nt unless it s really close to right
__label__False just so it doe nt when the microphone s dead it doe nt put out zero or mmhmm
__label__False and yeah it the cone is
__label__False i mean so the problem wi last time is that there were error in the transcript where they put beep where there were nt any or and they put in extraneous beep
__label__False but uh a a i said they re coming in
__label__False but w we ll see that then and how how it sort of evolves
__label__False but each one of the mixture component i mean you have uh uh variance only so it s kind of like you re just multiplying together these um probability from the individual feature within each mixture so it s so uh it seems l you know
__label__False so that s one thing um
__label__False but is nt that s again sort of the idea of the additive thing if it a a we had in the j stuff i mean basically if if you have random data um in in the time domain then when you look at the s spectrum it s gon na be pretty flat
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False that d be great that d be what i m having the transcriber here do cuz it can be extracted later
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i do nt think it can handle french but anyway
__label__False and um the the training the training i guess is always done on the close talking
__label__False well some people will yeah
__label__False but i think the argument should be uh can be made that you know despite the fact that this is not the most met metaphorical domain because people interacting with hti system try to be straightforward and le lyrical construal still is uh you know completely um key in term of finding out any of these thing so um
__label__False but yeah but
__label__False no they re super they re the they very quick
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True uh oh uh do you know geoff zweig
__label__False no then it would nt be a demo
__label__True i do nt know if dave is on the list if he s invited to these meeting uh if he know
__label__False i do nt see a manufacturer on it
__label__False oh plus the delta right ok
__label__False and that s what we were getting those number from right
__label__False uh uh again especially if there s hundred many hundred or thousand i still think it would it would cut the incidence of this a lot if it wa possible to break it into a couple file
__label__False i mean i m thinking politically
__label__False well this is this motivated but yeah oh yeah mo for sure motivated but then you ca nt parse on motivated
__label__False right
__label__False um hmm let s see
__label__False this is transcript l dash three o five
__label__False look at that struct in the output right
__label__False so i think certainly doing two beep is is nobrainer and then the other question is if they can
__label__False it s just a simple thing we put in
__label__False yeah if i
__label__False yeah
__label__False i i think eh it s enough eh for more peopl for more people after but eh
__label__False two o three five o o one two five
__label__False we re not delegitimizing the data we re delegitimizing the experiment
__label__False yes
__label__True well um i can give you an update on the transcription effort
__label__False sri recognition experiment
__label__False yeah
__label__False cuz i thought it wa like that one in
__label__False so that s not a lot of hour um
__label__False i did that with the last outage i j i wrote to them letting them know that this w wa not um
__label__False right
__label__False rad
__label__False oh this is your result are all with the clean lda result
__label__False yeah
__label__False and uh
__label__False yeah but you re still getting more recognition error which mean that the difference even though they look like they re not so big are are hurting your recognition right
__label__False smooth
__label__False um or at least like me personally i would i could nt use that data
__label__False yeah that s right
__label__False no no
__label__False two
__label__False yeah so with under um uh listening to the mixed channel there were time when a surprising a that is
__label__False nw archive that s what it is
__label__False or a beep and the number and then and then you just do the the num th you do it a a d a digit
__label__False ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False so i ha have nt hunted down all the all the mistake yet but
__label__False yep the aurora there s a special aurora
__label__False six five three three
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok everyone ready
__label__False oh thanks jose
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False and then forty for the other
__label__False uh but to estimate the performance of the vad we do nt want to do that because it would artificially increase the um the false alarm rate of speech detection right
__label__False no
__label__False in psy p psycholinguistics you have these experiment where people have perceptual bias a a to what they hear that that
__label__False we just came up here one night after recording so it took like twenty minute something like that
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False it s so whether i do depends on whether i m talking to him or him probably which meeting i m in
__label__False and there are some
__label__False um
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False well i th i m thinking just ch e e incorporating it into the representation i mean if it s if it s if you have start point if you have like time tag which is what i assume is nt that what what you well see adam would be
__label__False yeah it doe nt matter
__label__False you should probably make them out of yeah
__label__False oh right
__label__False is that some kind of base conversion or
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you mean the the most noisy occurrence on speechdatcar might be a lot more noisy than
__label__False right
__label__False i mean this is the reason why i have nt gotten back to it is cuz my first pas at it did nt really work because all the mike have different noise level and so i have to do something a little more clever
__label__False oh did he
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah one interesting note is uh or problem i dunno if this wa just because of how i play it back i say uh sndplay and then the file every once in a while uh like a beep sound like it s cut into two beep
__label__False action go and then they have the what the person claimed wa the source and the person claimed a the goal passed on
__label__False so we get
__label__False i suspect that s right
__label__False help
__label__False yeah yeah yeah cuz our sense from the other from the aurora uh task is that i mean cuz we were getting sub one percent number on tidigits also with the tandem thing so one so there were a number of thing we noted from this one is yeah the sri system is a lot better than the htk this you know very limited training htk system
__label__False yeah
__label__False using timit or using
__label__False so you
__label__False how about during the picnic
__label__False the different decision node you mean
__label__False doe nt say much
__label__False and
__label__False yeah a and um the map is more a mean for them to have the building and their name and maybe some ma ma major street and their name and we want to maybe ask them if you have get it sort of isolated street the the whatever river street and they know that they have decided that yes that s where they want to do this kind of action um that they have it with them and they can actually read them or sort of have the label for the object because it s too hard to memorize all these st strange german name
__label__False right
__label__False well you know it might be something we d wan na do with some uh s small subset of the whole thing
__label__False no the the question is do we save one or two farfield channel or all of them
__label__False good
__label__False ok which uh actually i i even on your fivelayer slide you you ve got an old one that that leaf that off
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok shall i shall i just start ok
__label__False and pratibha did something different is that he uh she initialed the um value of the mean and variance by computing this on the twentyfive first frame of each utterance
__label__False uh so he ll be interested in what s going on with that i guess wa the decision last time wa that the the uh transcriber were going to be doing stuff with the digit a well
__label__False ok
__label__False that s true yeah but that s that s ok cuz they re they re you know they re focused on the ear anyway and then and then the hack to preserve the overlap better would be one which creates different output file for each channel which then would also serve liz s request of having you know a single channel separable uh cleanly easily separable uh transcript tied to a single channel uh audio
__label__False i think you know one reason for that uh might be that there s still even though it s closetalking there still is some noise and some room acoustic
__label__False i do nt remember for voiceunvoice maybe for the other one for voiced i do nt reme
__label__False we we we have actually what we have is this line
__label__False and it s a l it s a lot better
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah or we could like add more uh sort of middle node like we could add a node like do they want to enter it which is affected by admission fee and by whether it s closed and by whether it ha a door
__label__False whereas th i i would think that uh you we can study more or le a a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah i
__label__False uh it would be to use his interface and i wa going to meet with him today about that
__label__False yeah but if it wa at your desk or something
__label__False uh so yeah
__label__False he
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__True i think the evaluation data come january thirty first so there s still a fair amount of time to do thing together it s just that they probably should be somewhat more coherent between the two site in that that amount of time
__label__False um
__label__False um
__label__False and it s gon na get more and more complex the the l complexer and larger our domain get
__label__False so we start with a um alil alignment that we computed with the b sort of the best system we have
__label__False so i i have nt tried that but that if it it might be something it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little
__label__False susi yeah
__label__False ok which is a a l a lapel in fact it s sticking through my lapel
__label__False ok i have nt seen that one yet
__label__False that wo nt be perfect the alignment are nt perfect but um it s probably still better to have all this extra data than yeah
__label__False interesting yeah
__label__False um
__label__False so
__label__False but then it wo nt i mean if we if we yeah i mean we should do whatever s natural in a meeting if if we were nt being recorded
__label__True well that may be another thing that keith want to look at
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False yeah i can guarantee that
__label__False i do nt know i do i do nt know the answer to that
__label__False k
__label__False i would nt call it a struct but
__label__False there you go
__label__True i do have a convention if it s an a noncanonical p that one i think we you know with eric s work i sort of figure we we can just treat that a a variant
__label__False yeah
__label__False and at least in compiler that s all that really matter a long a your analysis is finite
__label__False thirtytwo yeah thirty whatever
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False no it yeah yeah that s true
__label__False transcript l forty three
__label__False it s very exciting
__label__False but um
__label__False what
__label__False but it
__label__False right currently
__label__False i m working on a program to do that and
__label__False like are we adapting to it
__label__False um
__label__False but still that s that s a pretty big uh win and it doe nt seem like you re in term of your delay you re uh that
__label__False yeah you ha oh and each of these word ha a dedicated phone
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False one and
__label__False and uh since we re in a hurry we were just gon na read everyone all at once so if you sorta plug your ear and read
__label__False o zero two two seven zero zero three two four five o two four two six five nine nine six seven
__label__False we could
__label__False yeah well just transcript is just not available because nobody ha transcribed it yet
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok ok
__label__False actually roughly starting uh let s say nex next meeting cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report
__label__False no
__label__False the other thing one could do is could nt i mean it s so you have two category and you have markov model for each
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False it s noisy timit
__label__False that i do nt know
__label__False ok so i ll look into how you daisychain them and and then just go ahead and order them
__label__False ok so what if they have
__label__False the um th the other good thing about the alignment is that um it s not always the machine s fault if it doe nt work so you can actually find um problem uh proble you can find
__label__False well the thing that you is hard to deal with is whe when they speak while laughing
__label__False and which wa worse
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i i m actually just confused about the equation you have up there so uh the top equation is is is
__label__False yes
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah it s almost that it s almost an average somewhere around yeah
__label__False that s a clever thing to do what if you stopped being clever
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah well he yeah he had to figure out how much to add
__label__False oh good
__label__False right so so it i mean i i guess it s
__label__False something like that
__label__False that s why yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False alright good
__label__False what what if you right
__label__False maybe
__label__False um yeah e like the fact that the the model tend to align their first state on silence and their last state o on silence also so the reference reference alignment would label a speech some silence frame before speech and after speech
__label__False ok so you do nt know how the german dialogue uh the german the demo dialogue actually work it work the first thing is what s you know showing on tv and then the person is presented with what s running on tv in germany on that day on that evening and so you take one look at it and then you say well that s really nothing there s nothing for me there
__label__False well that s interesting
__label__False so
__label__False but in i mean in the real thing you re not gon na be able to measure what people are doing over half an hour or an hour or anything right so you have to come up with this number from something else
__label__False that s cool
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so
__label__False and so they re supposed to imagine that you know do they think the person want to go there or just know where it is uh which is probably not uh the case in that discotheque example or in the bavaria example you just want to know where it is
__label__False oh yeah um liz suggested we could start off by uh doing the digit all at the same time
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah if you have the pzms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice
__label__False turning off the microphone made it crash well
__label__False to go and to visit and what not
__label__False and um yeah basically it s to learn a mapping from from the mfcc s to uh phonological feature
__label__False cuz i mean i i know how to contact our student so if there s something that you re sending out you can also s um send me a copy me or bhaskara could either of u could post it to uh is it if it s a general solicitation that you know is just contact you then we can totally pro post it to the news group so
__label__False so there s a remapping of distant space into nearby space
__label__False n a three i think
__label__False yeah i i mean i in retrospect it would ve been good to ha have got i should ve gotten a headphone
__label__False s
__label__False but it s worse
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False not a lot but where the the wrong person the the speech is addre attached to the wrong speaker and you can tell that when you run it
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think e yeah it s it s just especially in these segment i mean you introduce um very artificial behavior and
__label__False yeah what is vt
__label__False yeah so we have this new speaker adaptation
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False this it s it s a cell phone jack
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i m adding complexity
__label__False uh we do nt have a active one but i ll make sure he s on the list
__label__False oh i see
__label__False and um
__label__False and and they all seem like good thing
__label__False right
__label__False wel
__label__False yeah
__label__False no no no but th the kind of robustness to noise so if if you take this frame uh from the noisy utterance and the same frame from the clean utterance
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah so it s gen it s general across all of these thing it s like
__label__False and this
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh is this the class project or
__label__False yeah right
__label__False i d like to do that again
__label__False but what are the value of the gothere discourse
__label__False it would be very good
__label__False so i i the idea is if we get good phone recognition result using um these set of acoustic event then um that that say that these acoustic event are g sufficient to cover a set of phone at least found in timit
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so i played with it after a while you do nt feel the difference anymore
__label__False overlapping speech
__label__False this is the idea
__label__False yeah this is another linear relation that this to develop this in vector s taylor series
__label__False yeah
__label__True yeah we were talking about that i m not sure if anyone s still using it
__label__False noise estimate signal to noise that s great
__label__False and and we
__label__False miguel is still an active member of the group and he s what i mean is he s an active member and he s still here
__label__False if
__label__False by going back to the fft you re getting something that is more like the raw data
__label__True now i guess what we should try doing with this is try testing these on u this same sort of thing on you probably must have this lined up to do to try the same t with the exact same training do testing on the other language
__label__False do you think the battery ran out or
__label__False uh abbott disk
__label__False we have the vad information also available at the backend
__label__False not yet
__label__False basically thing you ignore get marginalized over
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False doe it exist yet
__label__False oh ok
__label__False to each of the mel filter bank yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False um we re getting towards the end of our disk space so we should think about trying to wrap up here
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh i think we should disappoint him
__label__False a and i m still tinkering with the plp feature
__label__False so to smooth this thing yeah
__label__False and maybe you do nt wan na have it
__label__False but with this way we could say ok these are the discourse phenomenon they ra may have there own hidden layer that point to some of the the real hidden layer um or the general hidden layer
__label__False um i mean not uniformly
__label__False plp twelve online deltadelta and msg filter together
__label__False yeah and that that seems very uh easy to believe scenario i mean given the number of palm pilot we ve got on the table right now so
__label__False yeah
__label__False and with this you can specify the what s happening in the situation and what s happening with the user
__label__False transcript l dash three eleven
__label__False yeah i mean just never mind what they are uh it s just if x and n are variable
__label__False turn off the mike otherwise it get really tough for the tr
__label__False it s
__label__False you we just run the risk that if you have a crash we lose the data so
__label__False the feature yeah
__label__False this is on just digit
__label__False yeah
__label__False right what would this be like if w it were perfect if this component were perfect
__label__False uh and i also would nt think the cpu uh would be much either for that part
__label__False ok
__label__False i do nt know forty
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but that ha nothing to do with what we re testing on right
__label__False ok
__label__False so it s they actually say the monkey in front of the car where s the monkey
__label__False yeah
__label__False and then it never
__label__False mmm
__label__False and are nt these pretty bad microphone
__label__False right
__label__False ok so that s that s all fine but what you re saying is that when you do these so let me try to understand when when you do these same improvement to proposalone
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh
__label__False i like how we ve you guy have successfully narrowed it down
__label__False javier
__label__False yep
__label__False it actually say roemisch einz am smarticus which mean it s just using a german synthesis module for
__label__False but anyway there s there s there s uh uh other activity that are going on there and and uh and nist and uw so
__label__False yeah
__label__False four
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah mainly because of the sixtyfour hertz and the good vad
__label__False right
__label__False it s on training
__label__False d d is full
__label__False cuz we would nt have the correct node basically w what you re s proposing is a n whereis node right
__label__False yes y
__label__False yeah the first one yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False i mean if you just have one user that
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False maybe maybe they have
__label__False yep
__label__False hmm
__label__True may or may not be in in the morning i leave in the afternoon
__label__False yeah
__label__False um actually is there a way though to use whatever you re using for background noise to check post hoc that a microphone wa constantly on i mean
__label__False yeah
__label__False so i guess you know what i wa trying to remember some of the thing we were saying do you ha still have that
__label__False five nine four one six one nine five six seven
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh we um regarding the representation of overlap because at present um because of the limitation of th the interface we re using overlap are uh not being encoded by the transcriber in a complete and uh detailed a way a it might be and a might be desired i think would be desired in the corpus ultimately
__label__False for the plp
__label__False if doe
__label__True what wa it that you had done last week when you showed do you remember
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False so the net saw all the snr condition now after cleaning up it s a different set of snr
__label__False so i wa just realizing we ve you guy have been talking about he um for at least uh i do nt know three three four minute without ever mentioning the person s name again
__label__False hmm
__label__False but eh i i do nt distinguish between the the number of eh speaker
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i mean longerterm if it s if it turn out to be useful one one might want to do something else but
__label__False i sorta wish jane wa were here because i think she gave
__label__False oh good good
__label__False ok
__label__False is this proprietary
__label__False you like you could have a post office with uh you know nice mural or something
__label__False and then they could just fill that in
__label__False well should we restart the recording at this point
__label__False oh it i
__label__True when when when do you folk leave
__label__False and i do nt have an ip address they ca nt look up they do nt know who localhost is and so forth and so forth
__label__False i there is a a study on the difference between english and german on exactly that problem
__label__False so this is just again a an xml schema which defines a set of possible uh permissible xml structure which we view a input into the bayesnet
__label__False it s another type of approximation because i because it s a statistic statistic approximation to remove the noise
__label__False yeah i m just gon na sit here and growl
__label__False i mean my assump
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False i for now i ok now i have the order of magnit i m not sure about the order of magnitude wa it like from ten percent to eight percent or from e e you know point you know from one percent to point eight percent i mean it s a
__label__False so plug i so like the headphone output in the back of the computer
__label__False cze cone shape uh which can like yo you can have um a trajectory for the speech and then when you are in the silence it go somewhere but if the noise is different it go somewhere else
__label__False i i if you compare everything to the first case at the baseline you get something like one point one for the for the using the same language but a different task and something like one point three for three three language broad stuff
__label__False and fo for you to get a credit for it so
__label__False right well
__label__False ok hmm
__label__False right right
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False of sort yeah
__label__False ok so sorry i missed ok great but it ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i do nt really understand what he s doing yet but it it it sounded like um the channel normalization part um of his thesis um wa done in a a bit of
__label__False it s gon na be one y you ll pick one of those for ok these are this is just a layout of the possible that could go play that role ok go it uhhuh
__label__False well
__label__False and the second column is the channel
__label__False yeah alright s so where are we
__label__False so this week yeah
__label__False so b that s ok i mean b but the difference is
__label__False so what i d i d i took a handsegmented sample and i added ten time the amount of number at random and it did pick out pretty good boundary but this wa just very anecdotal sort of thing
__label__False dot com
__label__False so the basic requirement fulfilled
__label__False yeah is uh it right
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False what will happen in a general way i
__label__False but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah similarly closed i guess
__label__False um i did some experim uh uh just a few more experiment before i had to uh go away for the w well that week
__label__False that make a lot more sense to me now
__label__False or it can be al
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um and i did nt hear back so i thought ok it s probably too hard he s overloaded i wo nt say anything i ll just do it
__label__False htk system and run that again
__label__False that s how we get our feature file and everything for all the prosody
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False really
__label__False right
__label__False mmm
__label__False smartkom also
__label__False yeah well ok
__label__False right
__label__False so
__label__False right and then
__label__False right no faculty
__label__False ok so this is this is the pzm nearest the eh eh the machine room end of the table
__label__False o seven o eight
__label__False yeah no it s make sense to look at low frequency
__label__False and is are i i are are any delta being computed of tha of them
__label__False ehhh um it s just underneath uh um that reference to metaphor so it s the last paragraph before two so on page two um the main focus
__label__False nine six one eight five nine seven seven five
__label__False but it s kind of weird to read
__label__False good yeah so let s go with that uh
__label__False you have some
__label__False but the the only number that s still i mean which stephane also got in his result wa that medium mismatch of the finnish which is very which is a very strange situation where we used the we changed the proto for initializing the hmm i mean this this is basically because it get stuck in some local minimum in the training
__label__False y s so i wa i actually ran the experiment mostly and i i wa i wa hoping to have the plot with me today i just did nt get to it but um yeah i wou i would be curious about people s feedback on this cuz i m
__label__False but um it did occur to me that we could go to friend in broadcast medium and say hey you have this panel show or this you know this discussion show and um can you record multichannel
__label__False and and it really depends on what kind of research you re doing
__label__False so this is the situational context everything in it is that what situation is short for shi situational context
__label__False so once it s on tape
__label__False ok
__label__False icsi and epfl which is the uh
__label__False i looked through the transcript that we have so far and um fou identified a couple different type of thing of that type and um one of them wa something like uh during the course of the transcript um um w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on and um the question wa raised
__label__False this wa boy this wa a while ago this wa about twelve twelve year ago or something
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False um a in every humanhuman telephone conversation and the humancomputer telephone conversation is of course quite d quite different from uh some first uh observation
__label__False say they actually last like five year huh in in the typical case and and occasionally you might need to recreate one and then you get your tape out but otherwise you do nt
__label__False oops
__label__False ok so that s good that s better than running into problem
__label__False and then in that second row or whatever that row of time of day through that
__label__False yeah you would think it would be rare i mean we re not talking about the energy crisis or something people have
__label__False yeah but the the second expression that you put is the firstorder expansion of the nonlinear relation between
__label__False when you this uh eh
__label__False um and
__label__False well when i wa looking for space for thilo i found one disk that had uh
__label__False cuz of memorial day
__label__True morgan when s the demo
__label__False oh i see why we ca nt do that
__label__False yeah but
__label__False yes
__label__False one wa the uh i guess the software
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__False and how how much disk do we have
__label__False and um actually regarding the phase normalization so i did two experiment and one is
__label__False cv and then give them access
__label__False i mean earlier you never had any compensation you just trained it straight away
__label__False n right
__label__False yeah
__label__False this is usually um
__label__False yeah
__label__True i ll talk to brian and see what he
__label__False yeah
__label__False two seven five one zero two five zero two two
__label__False and in a sense that wa cheating
__label__False it turned out there wa a bug in my matlab code
__label__False or maybe um a famous restaurant or i do nt know there are various thing that you might w not want to eat a meal there but your own table
__label__False i guess it depends
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False i i mean i do nt know if we had the if we had the telephone on the table
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the only question is
__label__False w well it c
__label__False i sorta spotchecked here and there and it sounded pretty good
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh do i have it here
__label__False and this is fixed
__label__False but it s not it it s
__label__False yeah it s fixed yeah mmhmm
__label__False that s
__label__False i see
__label__False uh because well the vt method
__label__False and
__label__False hmm
__label__False s
__label__False and so uh some of the question on this is what do we do about the privacy issue
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but see the thing is if it s
__label__False within that yeah and uh it s a and still i think you know get something done
__label__False you can
__label__False nope just s l start up a new do
__label__False i would li i would like to see those picture yeah
__label__False um
__label__False that s true yeah
__label__False right
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False pmake stuff pmake magic or custom magic
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah anything with a question mark after it in that picture is a binary node
__label__False yeah
__label__False then they could nt
__label__False should nt it be
__label__False i mean i it it may be that that you re finding something good and that the variance is sort of artificial because of how you re getting your truth
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False i g i g i guess you could say iteration
__label__False this is the difference ok
__label__False what are some of the other feature besides the energy you said you re trying some different feature or something
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep
__label__False that that could be
__label__False yeah not that nsa
__label__False hmm
__label__False so like uh oh i do nt know like back vowel front vowel
__label__False yeah
__label__False but the point is that we wan na get a set of clean digit
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False the solution they proposed wa that it wa due to syntactic factor
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok i guess i m just one off
__label__False well these
__label__False yeah and a short short amount of time just to again just to see if that information is sufficient to uh determine the phone
__label__False yeah see i i happen to like the old one better
__label__False well
__label__False oh yeah sh
__label__False um well
__label__False but if you look at the um highly mism high mismat the output of the net on the high mismatch case and just look at you know the distribution versus the the other one do you do you see more peak or something
__label__False right
__label__False from scratch
__label__False ah
__label__False which i m sure would make ever the sysadmins very happy
__label__False mmm
__label__False they are working on this already because yeah su sunil told me that he wa trying already to put some kind of uh filtering in the france telecom
__label__False it s
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False but none of that ha a short time fuse
__label__False if it ll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff that s perfect
__label__False well and furthermore i it s now fairly routine in a lot of arrangement that i do with people on contract and so forth that that uh if it s if it s that sort of thing where you re you re saying uh ok i agree we want eighty hour of this person at suchandsuch amount and i agree that s ok uh if it s a follow up to some other agreement where there wa a signature it s often done in email now so it s it s ok
__label__False but w
__label__False from the network it s twentyeight so
__label__True ha ha ha joachim sokol replied or
__label__False maybe the bias toward tango ing wa yours then
__label__False mmm
__label__False so if you use like an idl vad uh for dropping the frame the best that we can get i that mean that we estimate the silence probability on the clean version of the utterance
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so d s so fo not well for everything for s for f even feature normalization for uh vocal tract length estimation all of all of these assume you know who s speaking so you would have to do a speaker segmentation first on the farfield micropho signal
__label__False so until you put the second path in with the pure feature the neural net wa nt helping at all
__label__False to some de uh what what part of th the smartkom stuff
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the error rate increase u of of of ten percent relative
__label__False we simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session and so then after that the person s told that they re now talking to a uh to a human
__label__False work to do
__label__False but
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False fr ge germany s got two big technical institute there s one in in
__label__False anyway yeah so we ll we ll look at this
__label__False right so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is ok
__label__False and secondly now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this and especially since um
__label__False yeah
__label__False i guess the fact that the there s a complete separation between the observed feature and in the output
__label__False because we have like meeting that have a reason that s one of the reason that we were talking about this and and those and this sound like it s more of an experimental setup it s got a different purpose
__label__False n run all our job on your machine
__label__False don and
__label__False so what you do um i just wan na understand so
__label__False oh maybe m you could you kn uh show thilo that
__label__False and that s another thing she said this is this is bever s bever s effect when where
__label__False wow
__label__False it ll ask you what you what it want what you want to open it with and see what bat i guess
__label__False i mean i think the question is is there is there some advantage
__label__False so you could argue in fact that the wellmatched is something you should nt be looking at at all that that the goal is to come up with feature that will still give you reasonable performance you know with again gentle degregra degradation um even though the the testing condition is not the same a the training
__label__False cv is pretty good
__label__False ye cool
__label__False no no praat is nt praat s multiplatform
__label__False huh
__label__False i have to to check that well i have i will
__label__False yeah unknown right
__label__False right so it s
__label__False oh this friday
__label__False oh good question
__label__False right so
__label__False yeah it s the shadow
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah why do nt you run it today ok
__label__False so if you if you run it on the new version then the number will be um and you compare it to the to run on the old version then you re gon na end up with more of an improvement than would actually be the case
__label__False eight
__label__False the demonstration by hand segmentation by hand i i i think is the fast experiment
__label__False mmm
__label__False the waveform you re looking at doe nt change
__label__False zero five five one four nine nine five five three
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah instead of the wave file and then w using multiwave you can add a file and play that sound
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False zurich
__label__False so
__label__False i can go next yeah
__label__False well yeah actually it s it s not the the lda filter it s something that s also short enough in in latency so
__label__False but perhaps something intermediary using also some broad class could could bring so much more information
__label__False o three six one six zero nine zero five four zero three one two o o three zer three zero five five one nine one five six five seven two seven nine o eight nine three four three o o nine six o
__label__False yeah
__label__False but i do nt actually know
__label__False i mean y d you you can do sort of a check but it will be very hard to tell the difference between that and um someone not talking
__label__False yeah
__label__False and there were a couple of difference like the lda filter were not the same
__label__False just like i th like th a if there were these waveform segment but instead you have sort of feature file segment
__label__False except that you would nt transcribe them all individually right you would send i mean uh a transcriber is used i mean i do nt know assume presumably a transcriber transcribes a single meeting right and so they they just have to indicate that the speaker change
__label__False i h hynek last week say that if i have time i can to begin to to study well seriously the france telecom proposal to look at the code and something like that to know exactly what they are doing because maybe that we can have some idea but not only to read the proposal look insi look i carefully what they are doing with the program and i begin to to work also in that
__label__False but the bottom line is it s still not uh separating out very well right ok
__label__False so the fiftyone point o nine ha become fortyeight point o six which is like three percent relative degradation
__label__False i think it s two gig an hour
__label__False it s a soft and i guess but in in principle you you wan na get a strong concurrence of all the different thing that indicate something and then he or s across the different soft or s across the different uh multiband channel
__label__False a few month later they listen to it and they say ope they got that acronym wrong
__label__False um
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh oh i see i see
__label__False yeah i think what you do is in when when you have the the this multicondition training mode um then you have then you can train model for the speech for the word a well a for the pause where you really have all information about the noise available
__label__False it wa very funny
__label__False oh maybe the fmri stuff should i mention the fact that um we re also actually started going to start to look at people s brain in a more direct way
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False y yeah bu
__label__False oh
__label__False and we are sending them the compressed one right
__label__False yeah so
__label__False do you mean the kind that hang from the ear sort of thing or the
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah it wou the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able if you were zoomed in enough in transcriber to see all the word you would be able to like have the word sort of located in time if you wanted to do that so
__label__False uh both i ve burned them and they re still ok i mean usually they re
__label__False um i mean the transcription i think are a bit of an unknown cuz we have nt gotten those back yet a far a the timing but i think a far a the collection it doe nt seem to me l like uh unreasonable to say that uh in
__label__False yeah
__label__False and is this with the revised online normalization
__label__False and then there
__label__False yeah
__label__False right well that s what we were calling spurt so
__label__False so th s so yeah but some so some thing would drop out and some thing would still be important
__label__False so that the the silence model in htk will always pick it up
__label__False i have a suggestion actually even though it ll delay u slightly would would you mind running into the other room and making copy of this cuz we re all sort of
__label__False for one of one of
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh lem me say that my uh
__label__False right from zero to four k
__label__False um because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment um in region where there wa no real speech yet from the foreground speaker
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False nine o five seven six eight four five one five three eight two nine eight four eight two o three five two
__label__False yeah
__label__True monday or tuesday so
__label__False if the f if the wavefront are not approximately planar then you ca nt just do delay and sum and expect it to work
__label__False yeah the the
__label__False ok um
__label__False um
__label__False the early experiment that
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah the linear fit
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah something like that and then then we r
__label__False this is
__label__False it s rad even
__label__False yeah
__label__False so that s how it wa generated
__label__False well it s just the difference between voiced and unvoiced
__label__False ok
__label__False well it s it s
__label__False but uh it s free
__label__False well
__label__False yeah so we talked about getting something together for that but maybe uh maybe we ll just put that off for now given that
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False so there s actually
__label__False so um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False jeremy on his project and then i ve been trying to track down this bug in uh the icsi frontend feature
__label__False yeah i wa gon na mention that
__label__False no but that it s interesting
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so where is the baseline for the tidigits located in here
__label__False um so u i since they have these three category it seems like the reasonable thing to do is to go across the language and to come up with an improvement for each of those
__label__False i think so do you
__label__False did did you k
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False wha wh i i uh how is that uh
__label__False and um hopefully it is by by mean of keith that we will be able to get a b a better formal and a better semantic um idea of what a construction is and um how we can make it work for u additionally his interest um surpasses um english because it also entail german an extra capability of speaking and writing and understanding and reading that language
__label__False but
__label__False which thing
__label__False ok
__label__False the vad yeah there first a threshold on the probability
__label__False ok
__label__False show is all testing for ti digit or
__label__False but if you wanted to do a more finegrained analysis and say you know how far into the word is the overlap you could do that it s just it ll just require more you know slightly different
__label__False i mean but without the neural network it s well it s better it s just when we add the neural network the feature are the same except that
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False oh maybe it s i am i m problem
__label__False make our stuff fit to that
__label__False out of out of film in particular
__label__False yeah right
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah and i and i tried t to normalize uh uh the feature there s loudness and modified loudness um within one channel because they re yeah to to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech
__label__False oh and plus the the vocal tract length normalization did nt actually made thing worse
__label__False i see
__label__False have you done digit before
__label__False and um the uh if i find someone at in eml that is interested in that um i
__label__False since we started doing this new uh beep format with beep number beep they ve given u uh i think two full uh transcript they have a third one and brian just sent me a note saying oh that third one somehow slipped through the crack of their tr of the eh transcriptionists uh s company
__label__False oh yeah yeah i d i just think i have nt figured out what the term in hugin mean versus what java bayes term are
__label__False i ve had people call me eva but i do nt know
__label__False twenty to to thirty percent further yeah
__label__False a r
__label__False so th the demo the demo requirement for this fall are sort of taken care of a of later this week or something and then so it s probably fifteen month or something until there s another serious demo requirement that doe nt mean we do nt think about it for fifteen month but it mean we can not think about it for six month
__label__False i never really knew what wa going on i mean i i find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that that i m out of film mean that i have left the state of having film or something like that but
__label__False yeah i mean it s not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short word than long word anyway just because you re accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and so we need we definitely need to go buy uh you know forty gig fifty gig of drive drive space
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False ah
__label__False bootstrapping would imply it wa actually legitimate in some kind of way
__label__False after the after uh the result for the tidigits on the meeting record there will be foreigns people
__label__False yeah
__label__False right so i th i think that if we are able to keep that up for a few month we are gon na have more like a hundred hour
__label__False so the result the trend the only trend i could see from those result wa like the the p the current noise estimation or the uh noise composition scheme is working good for like the car noise type of thing because i ve the only only p very good result in the tidigits is the noise car noise condition for their testa which is like the best i could see that uh for any nonstationary noise like babble or subway or any street some restaurant noise it s like it s not performing w very well
__label__False mmm
__label__False i do nt know i got this whacky idea that just from looking at the data that when people talk their word are usually chunked together
__label__False oh
__label__False no in this case it s just the gain and
__label__False you just change the threshold yeah
__label__False um yeah
__label__False um
__label__False how much memory doe he have
__label__False ok
__label__False yep
__label__False s so it s matrix between if it s not enterable period
__label__False yeah
__label__False so yeah we were looking at this but for most of the noise noise are um
__label__False um given that we re going to have for this test at least of uh boundary what if initially we start off by using known section of nonspeech for the estimation
__label__False right well this is this is just
__label__False would it help at all i mean we re already talking about sort of two level of detail in meeting one is uh um without doing the digit
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh excellent
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah and my question is if you did that if you followed my suggestion would it take much le time
__label__False yeah cuz you have a set of score about that so maybe then that would nt be so bad
__label__True uh ok well in my lunch talk last week i i said i d tried phase normalization and gotten garbage result using that l um longterm mean subtraction approach
__label__False oh no but it would still be even more of a binary decision
__label__False oh ok f yeah ok
__label__False right
__label__False i m i m willing to not work for an hour i know you re willing to not work for an hour
__label__False just sort of t to make sure that we can do that and
__label__False the question is just sort of how do we get the task in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task
__label__False like
__label__False but it s kind of painful for because basically if we put them on cd then each cd will have all the channel for one recording and then when you want to build the pfiles you just want to get one of those file off each of the session and
__label__False oh god know yeah yeah
__label__False e
__label__False that i mean just naming scheme will get
__label__False you just took one filter threw it there right
__label__False i mean the the the signal collected by the eh the real mike in the future in the prototype to to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech you have to to analyze you have to to process
__label__False just observable node evidence node
__label__False yeah
__label__False so i do nt think i can do the digit but um
__label__False so yeah we re will start to do this also
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean i also like this idea of high and low beep or
__label__False um i do several experiment with the spanish database first only with vt and nothing more not vad no lda nothing more
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False and oh ok so i can do an enterviewapproach it s not like that right
__label__False yeah
__label__False and also i did some experiment uh doing um a lying estimation of the noise
__label__False so in that case there is nt too much in parallel
__label__False i think the a certainly the segmentation and recognition we wan na maybe focus on when an andreas is here since that wa particularly his thing
__label__False so since he used the same exact pruning threshold for both
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah maybe
__label__False mmm
__label__False oh ok
__label__False there wa a one or twi once or twice in the re in the meeting we ve heard where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by but overall people are talking about technical topic nobody s gon na get hurt nobody s being l libeled
__label__False i did nt think it did learning
__label__False two nine six eight six three seven six zero five
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False what do you mean by that
__label__False yeah but
__label__False yeah
__label__False killing reasoning what s the difference
__label__False so can you send out a schedule once you know it jus
__label__False yeah
__label__False it could do you have to put it in your ear
__label__False oh
__label__False i mean that should nt be a problem
__label__False so i guess this is more or le now just to get you up to date johno
__label__False tha that s what they do yeah
__label__False that would all f funnel into one node that would constitute entrance requirement or something like that
__label__False yeah thank you
__label__False that s just me
__label__False ok
__label__False no it s not bad that s good
__label__False three one
__label__False so uh
__label__False hmm
__label__False so so uh um a significant reduction in the error for that would be great
__label__False yeah
__label__False transcript uh nine seven one nine nine o t
__label__False so that that s on our list too
__label__False well the other why do nt we do that
__label__False yeah
__label__False right i mean maybe there s something about the variance that s that s not enough or maybe there s something else that that one could use but
__label__False what s the fastest way
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the best wa fiftyfour point five
__label__False the lapel mike is a very highquality microphone
__label__False uh that s a proposed date i guess
__label__False mmhmm ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False there s got to be more than thirty hour i it could nt of
__label__False no
__label__False mr eleven
__label__False yeah i mean but there s a good question here like i mean uh do you when do you need
__label__False oh that s right that had those have not been sent
__label__False it s amazing what human being can do w when we talked uh we had the example you know of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station and somebody r run up to you with a suitcase in his hand say
__label__False transcript two four one one dash two four three zero five seven eight four four six nine six two one seven eight nine zero one one two eight six two three five two o two seven three nine five one four five six eight one three nine six two zero four
__label__False yeah
__label__False increasingly high higher frequency
__label__False yet
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False what about joachim maybe he can
__label__False because nob you know it
__label__False so much fun
__label__False oh
__label__False andreas stolcke and and his gang when they have um changed the language model of the recognizer and the dictionary then we can actually a put it all together and you can speak into it and ask for tv and movie information and then when if if something actually happens and some answer come out then we re done
__label__False ok
__label__False should be in ninety somewhere
__label__False oh this is a conference call for uh uh aurora participant sort of thing i see
__label__False i think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping event may be difficult even for human to tell that there s two there
__label__False yeah
__label__False but but i have i mean people people at sri are actually working on digit
__label__False is it the channel or the mike i do nt remember it s the mike
__label__False and that work fine except it s even slower to load it s already pretty slow to load
__label__False it sound like an f there s also an f in german which is why i
__label__False so there s there s uh all this linguistic stuff about you know near and far or yon and and so forth so this is all this is there s this linguistic fact but apparently the uh here s the way the finding go
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False twelve minute twelve
__label__False uh
__label__False um we were joking about having lunch up here but eating with the microphone
__label__False wh when you train the neural net y y you
__label__False you re all watching this is terrible
__label__False yeah mmhmm
__label__False so they doubled the the end the end of this
__label__False so i think you know that s that s the difference a far a the timing right
__label__False i mean it s like you have the so you know that
__label__False and um
__label__False i see
__label__False uh is dave
__label__False so it s done it s done new for each new utterance so this change the whole mapping for every utterance
__label__False so is it a fixed number or or do you leave it open it could be between one and fifteen uh it s it s it s flexible
__label__False so rather than doing nearest neighbor where you compare to every single one you just pick a few critical one and
__label__False perfect
__label__False yeah it s a great story
__label__False and
__label__False yeah i be pretty good
__label__False adam s point about when you were reviewing the ibm transcript u this wa mentioned at the beginning of the meeting
__label__False so um
__label__False i think there s some issue about u
__label__False that s great
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean it it s not a big deal but it s yet another thing you have to do
__label__False i used um amtrak quite a bit on the east coast and i wa surprised
__label__False yeah he s probably off at at uh his meeting now yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False adam s agenda that definitely involved you wa s something about smartkom
__label__False i mean but they re even like
__label__False you mean that the the grouping is supposed to be synchronized
__label__False ok so
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False i do nt think that wa the new version
__label__False well
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean you know what the straight feature do that give you this
__label__False the um
__label__False is this oh from the from
__label__False is that the actual name
__label__False yeah you sort of move thing around until you get to a low information point and yo then you can bring in the other person so it s actually not even possible i think for any person to listen to a mixed signal even equalize and make sure that they have all the word in the right order
__label__False in listening to some of these meeting that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spike on particular thing and in pact in fact this one i m talking on is one of of the one that showed up in one of the meeting so i mmhmm yeah
__label__False so the issue is that um in beliefnets it s not common to do what we did of like having you know a d bunch of value and then unknown a an actual value
__label__False very s
__label__False yeah
__label__False well but you can have it nw archive to you can have uh a nonbackedup disk nw archived and it ll never show up on the nightly backup
__label__False no no no
__label__False ok
__label__False i do nt remember if we talked about that last week or not but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning uh
__label__False yeah i i i do have it here
__label__False ok
__label__False i m talking about new one because because because we would be asking them to do something different
__label__False yeah perhaps you re right but you have more class so you you have more information in your feature so
__label__False but for this you only have to look right now on the speechdatcar performance uh because i did nt test so i did nt test the spectral subtraction on tidigits yet
__label__False oh ok
__label__False so in that case
__label__False oh
__label__False i ll i ll borrow the head back and and agree
__label__False i mean that um jane s i n the pickup of adam on this mike is gon na be different than me in term of energy and so forth over the whole meeting
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think i sent around last week a this plan i had for an experiment this matrix where
__label__False um yeah so the next thing is to use this a a maybe initialization and then use something online but and i expect improvement at least in finnish because eh the way
__label__False but uh i think the per the people it disrupts the most are the transcriber
__label__False and now we re seem to be kind of in a position to actually uh look at stuff and and and compare thing
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah we ca nt do it
__label__False so
__label__False uh so yeah
__label__False uh just the raw data you would you might hear kind of an echo
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm exactly
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False you wan na say where are al where find all the contentious thing i said
__label__False zero six six three nine seven six nine three five
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False on the other hand when you re doing uh research you may eh you might find that the way that you build up a change from a ninetyfive percent accurate system to a ninetyeight percent accurate system is through ten or twelve little thing that you do that each are point three percent so so the they they it s i do nt mean to say that they re they re irrelevant
__label__False w
__label__False ok yeah s i guess he d be the person
__label__False great thank you
__label__False um yeah but there s like a certain level of
__label__False yeah soon
__label__False right
__label__False i also um have nt got the code yet i have nt asked hynek for for the for his code yet
__label__False wha
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean
__label__False yeah none of the e email bounced so i know they re going somewhere
__label__False hynek proposed again to his uh trap so
__label__False these theory thing are pretty amazing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False to you
__label__False ok
__label__False and intention will be rid
__label__False ok that s what i mean so like those task are all gon na be um unambiguous about which of the three mode right ok so t
__label__False i see
__label__False yeah h he like to use them both cuz then it ha one part that s discriminative one part that s not
__label__False and i i found that eh another thing
__label__False and uh mmm and ask the network to put one at one side of the for for a particular phoneme at one side of the boundary decision boundary and one for another phoneme at the other side
__label__False i just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i have nt used it a lot and i have nt used it in the last you know many month so um uh we can ask someone
__label__False and i uh i mean it depends how this really end up working out but i guess my thought wa that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something wa ok or not and needing to listen to it wa gon na be extremely rare
__label__False it s pretty simple pretty simple
__label__False maybe we can stick them in another system i dunno
__label__False hmm
__label__False i mean you do nt have to physically put a tape in the drive or s
__label__False right
__label__False hmm um also you had the adaptation in the sri system which we did nt have in this
__label__False um so support vector machine are are good with dealing with a le amount of data and um so if you if you give it le data it still doe a reasonable job in learning the the pattern
__label__False right right r
__label__False so maybe we should talk
__label__False um and i agree that you know this is something we need to discus yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False so uh i retrained the network with these well the the the network are retaining with these new feature
__label__False yep e
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False they prefer to have them on just so that they re continuing to get the distant uh information
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah it s f only used in a community that doe some type of computational modeling i think it s really not used in any kind of community doing experiment on human perception or
__label__False yeah and yeah a much work a you want
__label__False no oh that s good ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False and i i think w w
__label__False and they re gon na be you know fleshed out in in their real ugly detail sourcepathgoal and there s gon na be s a lot of stuff on the goal and blahblahblah that a goal can be and so forth
__label__False i i ll have done i m probably doing something wrong
__label__False should be ok yeah it compiled fine actually no no error nothing so
__label__False and you say it s cheating because you do nt actually compute it
__label__False yeah uh no that it tha that s right
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False and so this would be a useful thing um to know in term of like which which um which of these category are are good for um speech recognition
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah because there is perhaps one important thing that the net brings and ogi show showed that is the distinction between sp speech and silence
__label__True what is meet meeting map
__label__False right so we we could probably do an extraction that wa roughly equivalent
__label__False are we recording it
__label__False well but the
__label__False ok
__label__False no i m talking about the noise
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False shall we do digit
__label__False but um clearly when we actually get here we ll move thing around this a we need to but so you ca nt absolutely count on it but but uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False spit right here
__label__False right
__label__False why do nt you mention thing about this bhaskara that i am not that are not coming to my mind right now
__label__False yeah
__label__False so it s possible that a lot of the problem with so many insertion and so forth would go away if they were better word model to begin with
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you know
__label__False and then um uh also dave is is thinking about using the data in different way uh to um uh explicitly work on reverberation starting with some technique that some other people have found somewhat useful and yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah that should be fine
__label__False something you want to inspect at close range because it s interesting ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but i i mean i think also to some extent it s just educating the human subject people in a way because there s
__label__False so he ll get you some data
__label__False uh i i think that s nicer for a lot of reason but might be a pain so uh
__label__False about a month
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no wait more disk is better absolutely i mean my my preference would be to get get ourselves a hundred gig of disk and just not bother
__label__False three three eight nine seven four three one
__label__False cuz that s what i mean in the bayesnet you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node so i mean you may not even bother to compute thing you do nt need
__label__False and um part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal groupware server at eml make that open to all of u and them so that whatever we discus in term of parsing and and generating and construction w we we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um get some overlap get some synergy out of that
__label__False yeah you can
__label__False there is an h somewhere printed
__label__False y i mean john osterhout uh
__label__False i have taken care that we have the the japanese generation and stuff and so
__label__False two three three zero six seven eight seven six two two four six two eight five four four three eight one five eight zero seven two three seven five six six two three five six five eight nine seven four one one eight eight five one three seven one seven five five six three zero three four zero four five nine nine one eight nine seven one three seven two four nine one two one six seven three nine four seven three
__label__False yeah we need to figure something out cuz the
__label__False yeah that s great
__label__False so then the feature we decided or we decided we were talked about right
__label__True early july late july
__label__False right
__label__False well
__label__False so if you go to the speech local web page and then there s a disk status page you can click on that and it ll query abbott and give you a a list of all the disk that we have and then uh what s on each one and then it show how big the disk is and what percent full it is
__label__True sixteen to eighteen i think
__label__True ok and you can ask kevin
__label__False maybe that s it because it seems like just adding information should nt give worse result but i guess if you re keeping the number of gaussians fixed in the recognizer then
__label__False yeah
__label__True absinthe which is the multiprocessor unix linux
__label__False well
__label__False hmm
__label__False o eight zero one o three one one three zero six four four three five seven two six seven one three eight seven eight nine zero one one two four two two three five zero seven four five six zero three three eight one six zero three two five mine one eight seven
__label__False i i can hear it
__label__False so this mean um
__label__True did i have another topic on the on the list
__label__False i do it again
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False well
__label__False well there s sort of there s this one called
__label__False uh
__label__False and so um their guess of eighteen state seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest word of the italian digit the four and five which um according to my you know sort of off the cuff calculation should have eighteen state each
__label__False wow
__label__False uh y w when i say it s worse it s not it s when i i uh compare proposaltwo to proposalone so r uh y putting neural network compared to n not having any neural network
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um and uh what i like about it in a way is that uh the result are still so terrible
__label__False anyway
__label__False uh
__label__False and i put together the fifteen feature and the three mlp output
__label__False yeah can you go back to that one
__label__False it got better that s the important thing yeah but it s
__label__False do something about
__label__False jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard
__label__False yeah
__label__False so uh what what s on your queue for for recognition experiment let s talk about that for a second maybe
__label__False and you could have also indicated that by saying enter what are the kind of action i am
__label__False so are you
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False twelve ok
__label__False i ll convince you that that it s still important for you to listen to what i have to say next because of this and this
__label__False so uh
__label__False four two eight two zero seven four eight zero
__label__False well
__label__False n n yeah no
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm i see mmhmm
__label__False and when you have your final thing we go back to this
__label__False i ca nt figure out how to get the probability into it
__label__False yeah ok so this it s the magnitude squared or something ok so you have power spectrum added there and down here you have you you put the depends on t but b all of this is just you just mean you just mean the log of the of the one up above
__label__False yeah
__label__False transcript one nine seven one dash one nine nine zero nine
__label__False y yeah he just did nt say when so
__label__False um
__label__False oh yeah you do
__label__False is this anything different than the hmm system you were using before
__label__False metacomment
__label__False seven three five one three four two three one zero
__label__False yeah uh maybe i should write it on the board so there s four round of training um
__label__False and if we introduce now this this u spectral subtraction or wiener filtering stuff so usually what you have is maybe um
__label__False and so can they bleep within an utterance
__label__False so that s that s that s a that s a reasonable point that it in this domain you re gon na get le metaphor and more metonymy
__label__False that s why i put ten on here instead of thirty or forty or fifty
__label__False and the filtering i think if you can should nt take a lot of memory to do that
__label__False are you being silly
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah no well actually we could have jane uh jane s interested and curious about this stuff so she could attend one of probably not the decoder meeting but some of the other stuff she would be interested enough and have her read
__label__False ok
__label__False um you have more information in the uh posterior vector um which mean that
__label__False so
__label__False you you had three different version with different like pause threshold between the segment
__label__False so and i do nt have and i do nt um have a cell phone so i ca nt be having a conference call while driving
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False nonspeech sound
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False it ll keep your accuracy up
__label__False about plato and the book
__label__False ok
__label__False so how doe uh maybe i m going in too much detail but how exactly do you make the difference between the fft and the smoothed spectral envelope
__label__False and the person can say yeah sure sh this is something i would do i would go shopping
__label__False yeah this is the between
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i do nt remember w
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we ca nt expect this to be sort of at o point three three three o point three three three o point three three three right
__label__False sorry so where do the output of the net go into if you re doing phone recognition
__label__False well i i do nt remember
__label__False well a new meeting a transcript right but but i i for but for for presentation in uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True j jerry never sent out a sent out an email did he ever
__label__False yeah yeah i think it wa getting around one percent for the near for the n for the close mike
__label__False eh fiftyf six uh no the frame error rate fiftysix i think
__label__False oh so yeah so the only
__label__False maybe it s a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh a step away from i indicating that it really is intentional that those space are there and indicating why they re there to indicate that it s uh the you know uh enumerated or i it s not a good way of saying but it s it s the specific uh way of stating these these letter
__label__False alright so le let s make sure we do the one that that uh saved you so there wa some
__label__False seven four two two five zero three nine seven zero
__label__False yeah i just uh i just wa abbreviated it to struct in my head and started going with that
__label__False it would be separate the letter would be separated in space and potentially they ll have a curly bracket thing afterwards e but i m not sure if that s necessary clarifying what it is so gloss of whatever
__label__False but um
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False no it s not
__label__True that wa a question that wa kind of raised by mike shire s thesis and on in that case in term of reverberation
__label__False yeah
__label__False sorry
__label__False yeah
__label__False well no no y i there s infinite money see you th you th you then fill it with researcher
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike possibility of six wireless receiver and apparently you can chain those together
__label__False hmm
__label__False um back on the data thing so there s this sort of one hour ten hour a hundred hour sort of thing that that we have
__label__False ok but you can imagine maybe wanting the oth both kind of thing there for different um goal
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False what he doe is a a first pas he he p he doe um a guess at where the division might be and he overestimate
__label__False that uh on the i thing are somewhat better uh in proposaltwo for the wellmatched case and somewhat worse for the other two case
__label__False so just just for example
__label__False i think that s one of the thing that he said he would be working on um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well that the they would need that forty millisecond also
__label__False ok so anyway i looked at everybody else s stu
__label__False could that help a little bit
__label__False yeah
__label__False so i m not sure if if if we can use it she said she would give it to u it would nt be a problem
__label__False and i call that lie because you do nt really have that you just have some kind of signalprocessing trickery to get something that s kind of smooth
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh i see
__label__False wa nt there something of that where you say trained on spanish and tested on on tidigits or the other way around
__label__False that will be really interesting to see you know
__label__False and you know sometimes you have the yeah uhhuh
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok well do nt do nt make it a high priority i in fact if you just tell me like you know like two example i mean y
__label__False um i think i d h i d have to ask dave i did it once before and it wa just so slow to scroll that i gave up
__label__False i could
__label__False it s not quite better
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False you say i i i want to use this uh this item but i want to subtract off various kind of echo so you construct a filter and you have this this filtered version uh of the speech um get uh uh get subtracted off from the original speech
__label__False o three o zero two one five one eight
__label__False i m sufficiently clueless that i count a a
__label__False we also tried um absorbing these uh both laughter and and actually also noise and um
__label__False so over all it get yeah worse for the well matched condition so y
__label__False or something
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False which you ve already done obviously so
__label__False right
__label__True reginfo ok
__label__False so i i wan na i just keep the time until we actually wan na release the data and then we bleep it
__label__False no i m just
__label__False i did nt hear anything after that
__label__False ok that would be awesome
__label__False to do that we would add another uh value for that
__label__False so so you there s a tradeoff and i m wondering what criterion they use
__label__False yeah
__label__False and there again yeah
__label__False so we we basically we have a very open beam
__label__False for example there are some difference between hebrew and english
__label__False so there re lot of different owner of i i of the file but the group is always doctorspeech
__label__False it s with the clean lda
__label__False it s it s just getting it going
__label__False yeah
__label__False one eight four one seven seven zero zero seven zero s two seven seven zero two seven
__label__False ye
__label__False or maybe or maybe you re doing one too many i mean it s it s
__label__False i bet it would do even slightly better
__label__False yeah but if
__label__False yeah i m just thinking for people that that s not sufficient for what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them
__label__False when you when you say the input to the v java bayes it take a certain format right
__label__False um then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless
__label__False there s there s lot of thing you could make tshirts out of but uh this ha gotten
__label__False yeah i i d i think it s some
__label__False o zero one zero zero zero one three two four four five three six four five five six eight o six seven eight nine zero five zero two nine one zero three seven zero one six five nine nine two nine eight one one two seven three six four five six zero five seven seven eight zero eight one three six two nine two one
__label__False um the the goal that we ve d you guy have been talking about are this these you know identifying which of three mode um their question uh concern so it s like the enter versus view
__label__False right exactly
__label__False well we have
__label__True yeah um if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from yees asking you to send me the uh uptod current formalism thing that you presented
__label__False right
__label__True mr one i i mean the the one with dan elli in it and eric
__label__False no i think i i used this scheme a it wa before
__label__False uh not yet but i wi i will call them and now they are i think they have more time because they have this well eurospeech deadline is over and
__label__False he ha a trick for doing that involving viewing the dft a a matrix um but uh um i decided not to do that after all because
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s possible uh he wa he he you know we met and he wa gon na go and uh you know y look through them more systematically and then uh meet again so it s you know not a matter of a
__label__False maybe i m misremembering but i did not think it had a markov
__label__False oh ok
__label__False we have here some histogram but they have a lot of overlap
__label__False oh that s true
__label__True have they ever responded to you
__label__True so so do nt uh do nt do the division but let the net have everything
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean you could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent thing but there s also this sort of like causal well so one is really facilitating the other and it s part of a compound action of some kind which ha structure
__label__False so no matter what they said if i could map it onto a whereis construction
__label__False well yeah that s what i wa wondering
__label__False so it s well it s basically a standard net with fewer class
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i like
__label__False for the training of the neural net
__label__False for that s for the clean training and the noisy testing for the tidigits
__label__False i do nt exactly initialize the same way she doe
__label__False i also think um that the type of change ch ch varies an i think it s a very good point because what if the uh what if one set of change one person wa making wa with reference to some typographical convention
__label__False o four six nine o zero seven one six o one two three four zero zero zero six four seven six five nine nine zero eight five seven six seven two eight five six eight three six seven four one three nine eight nine
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah but i m not too sure if if we can really represent overlap with with the s detector i i i used up to now the to speechnonspeech a it s only speech or it s it s it s nonspeech so
__label__False just before they be before it go bad it burn them in
__label__False no basically w
__label__False right
__label__False zero six six five four two four three zero
__label__False nonbackup
__label__False ok
__label__False for each uh
__label__False so he s eight you re seven
__label__False uh
__label__False so another option is to copy it to tape manually so we have the backup copy and the tape copy the archive copy and the backup copy and then just take them offline
__label__False what s uh what s there
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False oh how how much is it and um yeah i would like uh um to g let s do it and so forth
__label__False so
__label__False and when they transcribe this meeting it s gon na be really impossible
__label__False i think it s it wa one or two percent
__label__False ok
__label__False it wa thirtyfive
__label__False yeah there uh actually yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so and we lose
__label__False but i i do nt i do nt think they re doing that though
__label__False three two three eight seven five four five seven seven zero zero
__label__False oh ok
__label__False and uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False o o five eight one one one five three five six four two seven five six o three six five four zero four five five six seven nine one nine four
__label__False you know just take f ten minute instead of an hour and a half
__label__False uh this is where they re supposed to
__label__True fletcher munson
__label__False yeah there are two curve
__label__False you know um neural net approach uh or gaussian mixture for that matter are sort of fairly brute force kind of thing where you sort of you predefine that there is this big bunch of parameter and then you you place them a you best can to define the boundary and in fact a you know these thing do take a lot of parameter and and uh if you have uh only a modest amount of data you have trouble uh learning them
__label__False can you mix t uh processor of different speed
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it wa a long time ago
__label__False or i guess the fullblown one is where you do the digit and everything and then talk about doing it without digit what if we had another level just to collect data which is without the headset and we just did the tablemounted stuff
__label__False uh yeah a good vad we put the good vad
__label__False yes yes since you bring it up now we will worry about it tell u more about it
__label__False that ll be i think that ll help
__label__False and
__label__False what wa it using before
__label__False oh in my name before the a
__label__False i have a problem then
__label__False wi but uh without any mark between the zone of the overlapping zone with two speaker eh speaking together and the zone with the three speaker it
__label__False and yeah it s an an it s it s sort of
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False from uh canonical mapping um at first and then it s unclear um eh using timit right right
__label__False i mean i
__label__False hmm
__label__False well but it s interesting cuz uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the forced alignment might not work then although we can try it
__label__False it combine them if it s if the pause is longer than
__label__False and everybody get a trampoline in their office
__label__False oh
__label__False but suppose you do nt really know what the right thing is and that s what these sort of dumb machine learning method are good at so
__label__False right
__label__False o two eight six one o five zero two one nine two seven five o two two six three nine nine eight three four o five seven two five six one o eight eight two eight four nine six four seven four
__label__False transcript l dash three five four
__label__False hmm where were they when we needed them
__label__False i see
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah yeah i think we have three of those
__label__False i guess a week and a half ago so we probably now have about thirty five hour
__label__False it should um inhibit that right
__label__False and similarly if you introduce a new metaphor it should then uh compose with all of the construction
__label__False this is more proximaldistal
__label__False ok
__label__False this is this by the way a bad thing we re trying to get um m more female voice in this record a well so
__label__False ok how do you get the your training data
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and that we a a group will try to to finish it what i d like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next monday
__label__False well matched condition
__label__False mmm
__label__False oh really
__label__False it s a pain
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right that s true
__label__False yeah i i started thinking about also i mean yeah uh i discovered the same problem when i started working on uh on this aurora task almost two year ago that you have the problem with this mulit a at the beginning we had only this multi condition training of the tidigits
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so maybe le let s do digit
__label__False ok
__label__False i think for engineering student of any kind i think it s it s if you have nt been there much it s good to go to uh to get a feel for thing a range of thing not just speech uh
__label__False no no but i think what she s asking is if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking instead of two did you call that one event
__label__False you re not gon na be here tomorrow
__label__False so tom cruise s house is not a public building but it ha a door
__label__False one of the thing i wonder about coming back to the first result you talked about is is how much uh thing could be helped by more parameter
__label__False what is uh
__label__False which is gon na be a little hard for a couple people because we have different digit form
__label__False mmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah when we look at at the um mfcc that result from this they are a lot more smoother
__label__False five three one nine four
__label__False yeah just yeah just smooth the the output of the of the detector
__label__False wordpad
__label__False right at the point where you ve done the subtraction
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm let s see
__label__False and and the i mean the other side to it wa the what which is where we were coming from i ll
__label__False yeah it s pretty horrible
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok then i will just go do that and send the bill to uh whatshername
__label__False and try to convince other topic to come in and do some cuz i think that would be nice
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False um well
__label__False but uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False so you got more slide
__label__False yeah
__label__False to get that uh pivoted this way it pivot like this
__label__False and there s a lot of out of analysis so um
__label__False i do nt know exactly s to think what we can improve
__label__False let s assume this is the output
__label__False right
__label__False this is hubfive
__label__False yeah that d be great
__label__False so it s this is a an optim somewhat optimistic view on it uh so you know the real thing is somewhere in between the two
__label__False we
__label__False really
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False i wa i wa on a uh on a on a different sidetrack i mean the the deep map project which um is undergoing some renovation at at the moment but this is a a three language project german english japanese
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False four eight eight seven two six one one two one
__label__False o five five six four zero five four nine zero one four two three four six two eight seven two five six eight seven zero nine eight seven three four five zero
__label__False the beep model is is gon na match like really well
__label__False um so
__label__False experiment
__label__False well that would nt have helped you at all
__label__False hmm
__label__False or the best we can get
__label__False tv broadcast type stuff i think it s a much wider range of channel and it
__label__False no it s d e
__label__False right the only problem with that is if anything go wrong or if you wan na switch from one thing to another
__label__False oh you do nt like htk
__label__False so this just add one
__label__False i think th the at least the once tha that you put it on it would it would kill that so
__label__False t
__label__False no but if you w just want to see what
__label__False or if for leave it on their voice mail
__label__False but
__label__False but we have to for sure we have to go down because the limit is now sixty feature so uh we have to find a way to decrease the number of feature
__label__False sunday because it s it s le expensive the price the price the ticket
__label__False yes um the lda filter need some training set to obtain the filter
__label__True ok our agenda wa quite short
__label__False i see
__label__False ye
__label__False and and then there wa two research question from that and one is the k doe it still work if you just use the past history
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False uh i know they re in
__label__False that wa that wa exactly the notion that that that we discussed so
__label__False i guess the troub trouble in my mind is that it that it s not a very neat corpus if you say
__label__False it s just gon na be a couple of
__label__False it now help if you do it only on the test and
__label__False cuz all we re really concerned about is missing beep or too many beep
__label__False it s located
__label__False no no the question is d do you wan na do you wan na construe do you wan na constrstrue r exactly it s because do you wan na c do you want to view the bakery a a p a place that that i for example if y
__label__False with by jane
__label__False i also looked thr over the text and i wa impressed by the accuracy it look really good
__label__False oh i ll wait until you re plugged in
__label__False um i think it s it s it s i mean experimental setup u on the technical issue yes except we st
__label__False yep yep
__label__False two two eight eight one eight four seven one one two seven
__label__False hmm
__label__False and then laughter is a is a special word
__label__False uh this is slightly off topic but uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False you wan na talk about recognition
__label__False i see
__label__False at interval or
__label__False but that would be something interesting t to to see
__label__False i i think you can do better by uh cloning so we have a reject phone
__label__False this is the
__label__False oh
__label__False well we ll just we ll we ll just have to note those
__label__False i did nt quite understand everything that i saw so
__label__False but the fundamental difference i mean there s other small difference
__label__False and then starting up on the thirteenth uh we ll have meeting again but we ll have to do without sunil here somehow so
__label__False well well you have to be careful with that uh uh thing because uh
__label__False it just that it s
__label__False yes that s not good
__label__False um so i think that you know this is a uh this is a neat data set
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False fi there s an lda filter
__label__False mmhmm ok
__label__False move it bit test
__label__False then i tried the same exactly the same spectral subtraction algorithm on these aurora task and it simply doe nt work
__label__False they can do experiment
__label__False yeah
__label__False sure i mean this sort of go back to earlier stuff by drullman
__label__False gaussians per state
__label__False yeah
__label__False test
__label__False i ve been working with um
__label__False do this in perl
__label__False no
__label__False well that s what he s seeing a one of the thing they could do it s just when you when you get all done
__label__False ok
__label__False o o two o six
__label__False oh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well i mean another s
__label__False yep
__label__False early in the conversation
__label__False uh so basically when it s trained on the the multilingual broad data um or number so the the ratio of our error rate uh with the baseline error rate is around uh one point one
__label__False l one fifty
__label__False i would i would also guess that a we get more into processing the data and thing like that there ll be more thing of interest to him
__label__False you mean the htk aurora baseline
__label__False so i mean it s interesting that h going to a different different task did nt seem to hurt u that much and going to a different language um
__label__False can we look at this
__label__False so instead of single node for like if they said the word admission fee
__label__False monehundred oh
__label__False mike four
__label__False right right
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm so basically d if you look at the at the left of the table the first uh row with eightysix one hundred and fortythree and seventyfive these are the result we obtained for italian uh with straight mmm plp feature using online normalization
__label__False you re you remember you re being recorded at this point
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False got it
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s definitely not the most frustrating meeting i ve ever had
__label__False cuz let me tell the gang what i think the punch line is because it s actually important which is that the construction that uh nancy and keith and friend are doing uh are in a way quite general
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i ll get it
__label__False you can also you can also reflect the data
__label__False so before it s like adding this col to the to the o exi original
__label__False o
__label__False i mean are you going to write down that i sat here
__label__False yeah
__label__False should we do digit
__label__False and so th
__label__False it s a even distribution like whatever
__label__False yeah i i i do nt know for sure
__label__False you d have to they d have to have the acoustic of dog t hear into the high high range
__label__False oh eh great
__label__False oh
__label__False we hope
__label__False uh fff i think that s it yeah uh
__label__False on only to mark only to mark overlapping zone but
__label__False it s also likely that people will cancel out afterwards but i but i wanted to raise the kpfa idea
__label__False how do i get to the bank
__label__False yeah well
__label__False hmm
__label__False and my my tendency right now is well if ibm come back with this meeting and the transcript is good just let them do it
__label__False yeah exactly
__label__False i have nt
__label__False so again that s that s three three hundred in fortyfive minute that are that are speaker just speaker
__label__False seven six two eight one nine five nine eight
__label__False i would prefer this
__label__False i d love to see it if you if you have a copy kind of uh
__label__False i guess we might hear something but
__label__True you might want to uh doublecheck the spelling of the author name on your reference you had a few uh misspells in your slide there like i believe you had jackendorf
__label__False so e because at the end the more we um add you know the more spiderwebish it s going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing it s going to get very ugly
__label__False yeah the y your native language right you remember that one
__label__False and i think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False six seven zero three four four nine five one two
__label__False yeah
__label__False well that s the variance but if you just say what is i mean to first order um yeah one of the difference between voiced unvoiced and silence is energy
__label__False and so we re gon na wan na be thinking in term of some wireless connection to it
__label__False done
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False but no the inference stuff wa wa wa lokendra ok that make sense yeah
__label__False er nah i do nt re i ve never been good at those so there s like the vp go to n and those thing in lisp and it will generate for you
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False notice how i said somebody and turned my head your direction that s one thing you do nt get in these recording you do nt get the do nt get the visuals but
__label__False so i um e you know i i brought them in and um trained them in pair because i think people can raise question you know i i the they think about different thing and they think of different and um
__label__False transcript two eight one one dash two eight three zero zero six one two zero five zero zero eight four four one zero one five six six seven four seven eight nine
__label__False it would actually slow that down tremendously
__label__False and then um if i thought it wa ok i d say it s ok
__label__False well u u
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and
__label__False yeah
__label__False but in this case if we say definitely he doe nt want to go there he just want to know where it is or let s call this this lookath
__label__False yeah
__label__False and
__label__False yeah the problem with that is i would i think i would feel a little constrained to you know
__label__False but i have a convention that if it s obviously a noncanonical pronunciation a speech error with you know wi within the realm of resolution that you can tell in this native english
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok that would be fun fun to try
__label__False through the old notepad that s my favorite editor
__label__False or from being read and read
__label__False yeah versus like i wa at this place in europe where they had little carving of like dead people on the wall or something
__label__True actually hynek should be getting back in town shortly if he is nt already
__label__False and so you change parameter what do you wan na say something about the parameter that you change
__label__False yeah mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False can i ask something real quick
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah i
__label__False um right so then landmark is
__label__False ok well
__label__False i m also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing cuz i think if they feel that uh it s i th i th you know if it turn out that something get published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and did nt detect then it could have been because of their own negligence that they did nt pursue that next level and get the password and do that um but but they might be able to argue oh well it wa cumbersome and i wa busy and it wa gon na take me too much time to trace it down so it could that the burden would come back onto u so i m a little bit worried about uh making it harder for them from the legal standpoint
__label__False so like this is from a stop to to a vo a vocalic segment you know so something that is transitional in nature
__label__False yeah
__label__False but on the other hand maybe they can get by with a smaller net and maybe sometimes you do nt run the other maybe there s a computational advantage to having a separate net anyway
__label__False so someone asked a question
__label__False and we can you can flip this and uh get rid of the screen but
__label__False oh so this is now it s it s compiled under solaris
__label__False oh
__label__False ok i have to report um data collection
__label__False so the new disk are installed now or
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False silence starting or silence ending
__label__False yeah alright
__label__False um tourist may have never have final destination you know because they are eternally traveling around so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of taskbased middle layer and then we ll get these submiddle layer that are more cuebased
__label__False weirder thing have happened
__label__False so then we re not spending the time writing it out so that we re spending the time talking
__label__False so those feature look at the data differently actually
__label__False um but i ll just
__label__False well it just yeah put it in the right range or
__label__False when for the person who missed gobbledygook what did they put
__label__False well
__label__False i like plugged some grouping for computing this eigen uh uh uh s value and eigenvectors so just
__label__False ok so now we may come back to the situation where we may be looking for a modification of the feature to account for the fact that we ca nt modify these parameter but um uh but it s still worth i think just since you know just chatting with joe about the issue
__label__False and for the whereis construction we know we need to l look at this node that merges these three thing together a for th to decide the response and since we have a finite number of construction that we can deal with we could have a finite number of node
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False transcription is done in munich
__label__False yeah
__label__False cuz even in people like they do nt know what you re talking about if you re using some sort of strange construction
__label__False one reason we re doing it this way is in case there s extra structure that s in the enter action that s not captured by the schema right
__label__False w which in it ha three language that s including the w the the the one that it s
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok so that s being done professionally and yeah
__label__False and it s night
__label__False i ll let i d let
__label__False no
__label__False yeah you do nt have to you could keep them short by not s or just go one through ten one through ten one through ten or one through twenty
__label__False because you will find run into uh well or into the cafe for that m you know his car ran into the cafe
__label__False on that one
__label__False ok so we re degenerating right are are are we done with uh mr business or
__label__False but but uh um
__label__False so should i just go do that
__label__False i mean i th
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False um nothing come to mind
__label__False but
__label__False um
__label__False i i it yeah
__label__False april twentysixth to the may fourth
__label__False but uh it ll tell you that this is what s showing in heidelberg and there you go and the presentation agent will go hhh nuh
__label__False experimental result
__label__False that s including digit i have nt separated it out so i have no clue how much of that is digit
__label__False so
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False eight seven three nine eight four nine six four six
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False got it
__label__False are very appreciative yeah
__label__False oh it would be
__label__False well yeah where it actually is is cover the whole range of thing
__label__False well what s the standard
__label__True i think it wa andreas wanted to talk about segmentation and recognition
__label__False the thing is like it s it s not s it s not that the thing doe nt exist commercially but there is nt one unit which doe the whole thing in one in one swoop
__label__False i
__label__False the number of cepstral coefficient is what
__label__False this further down the table
__label__False should i pull up the net again yes
__label__False now it might get a little better if we do nt have them do the digit all the time and the then so then they can just really sort of try to put the mike on and then just charge in and and
__label__False two nine zero five three six three six three seven
__label__False no it s not but this is the same oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False so we can do some more recording but there s there s a little little bit of ramp up on that over the next month say
__label__False well i can also th use this
__label__False i know right uhhuh
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False what kinda tape drive
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False yeah i can worry about the ontology interface and you can keith can worry about the discourse i mean this is pretty um i mean i i i hope everybody uh know that these are just going to be uh dummy value right where the
__label__False these are our fzero candidate which i m supposed to use for the synthesis thing
__label__False the the the representational problem are i m sure will be there like enough for me to think about so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False but but i it sound like
__label__False um i would nt well it they did nt say hate but they they c they come on time to their meeting in order to not be left the last person who ha to sit by those mike
__label__False would you pas those down
__label__False right
__label__False i mean cuz originally i had disc discounted that because it wa just gon na be too hard but now we have this procedure with the beep file worked out
__label__False so say like i know this particular segment is voicing um i would say uh go into the corresponding lna file and zonk out the the posterior for um those phoneme that um are not voiced and then see what kind of improvement i get
__label__False transcript l dash two eightytwo
__label__False ah ok mmhmm yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah but then you re not on the lexical level that s sort of one level higher
__label__False so yeah so if you if you put the delta before the uh ana online if yeah uh then then it could go in parallel and then y then you do nt have that additive
__label__True i think that one of the neat thing about having this little pilot thing from today is we should try it a couple different way so we should try to do it internally maybe ask ask jane if we could get her to do it or or or have her supervise a linguistics student or somebody and uh see how long it take and you know multiply out the cost and then send send the same thing out or maybe split it in half or something something like that to a to an outside service and uh see what that cost and how much hassle that is
__label__False with the uh
__label__False ok
__label__False this is going to be an interesting transcript
__label__False ok
__label__False well we have it saved so
__label__False it s a crosscorrelation filter
__label__False and the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the target from
__label__False ok that wa
__label__False i guess there s another aspect too and i do nt know uh this this is very possibly a different uh topic but uh just let me say with reference to this idea of um higherorder organization within meeting so like in a you know the topic that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other uh us of the data so being able to find where soandso talked about suchandsuch then um um e i mean i i i did sort of a a rough pas on encoding like episodelike level thing on the uh transcribed meeting already transcribed meeting
__label__False but
__label__False their uh the result look pretty good
__label__False i i saw that eh the eh speech signal collected by the eh this kind of mike eh of this kind of mike eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh we eh collected by headphone and
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so um like are you gon na have similar schema for fm like forced motion and caused action and stuff like you have for spg
__label__False alright so i ll just throw it out there if anyone know of one more m or two more wee meeting per week that happen at icsi um that we could record i think it would be worth it
__label__False that s kind of annoying
__label__False but th but that s that s n you did nt have to change the software for that yet right it s just formatting the right kind of uh xml
__label__False i mean you re done in the sense that um you may be able to get some new feature from sunil and we ll rerun it
__label__False find everything that should be bleeped
__label__False i got this crazy idea that um i in the future people will just walk around with the microphone that they use for their cell phone
__label__False which which we re abbreviating a rad
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i ve have never handled them
__label__False right
__label__False well s reference is one thing the question is is there any place oh did you put in something about uh the individual we d talked about putting in something about people had uh oh yeah ok
__label__False no interestingly enough
__label__False but i ll keep working on it but the what it mean is that it s likely that for net training and forward pass we ll
__label__False uh what s next
__label__False we will
__label__False so so you know sort of everybody is doing thing between well roughly a third of the error and half the error being eliminated uh and varying on different test set and so forth
__label__False i mean we tried a lot of thing in a hurry and uh if we can back off from this now and sort of take our time with something and not have doing thing quickly be quite so much the constraint what what you think would be the best thing to do
__label__False um then you just have to go back in and figure out where the endpoint of those segment are cuz some of them will be wrong
__label__False so i is the idea that you re going to take whatever feature you develop and and just add them onto the future vector
__label__False which is
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so the filler of the role source
__label__False if
__label__False yeah
__label__False thanks
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False right now it s a kluge
__label__False hmm
__label__False oh yeah this is
__label__False yeah the only the only part that might be confusing is when chuck is reading digit
__label__False ok
__label__False no no no but wait maybe maybe what we have instead of a beep is a uh synthesized number
__label__False yep
__label__False and uh should i should i explain uh more about what what i m proposing to do and s and stuff
__label__False um and that s now i m not going to bring that so that s basically what i have so far and the rest is for airplane
__label__False is it
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s removing the task specific training and it s adding other language
__label__False and right now we can have up to six
__label__False i have the spreadsheet for three different system
__label__False what
__label__False i mean it s probably more than that but but with of of nondigits
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok we re on
__label__True uh and you know i u when whenever anybody figure it out they should also for sure email hynek because hynek will be over there telling people what we did so he should know
__label__False so basically what i expect is that these number will a little bit go down but perhaps not not so much because i think the neural network learn perhaps to even if the feature are not normalized it it will learn how to normalize and
__label__False uhoh
__label__False not not unless you really really want to
__label__False o
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False tha that s true that s more severe but the next one say the transcript will be around and it doe nt really say we ll send it to you or wi it ll be available for you on the web or anything
__label__False yeah i think th th uh the new system that i tested is i guess closer because it doe nt have it have le of of france telecom stuff i
__label__False two
__label__False uh
__label__False oh
__label__False yep
__label__False hmm
__label__False a a a of no a little i do nt know when when did we grab the transcript
__label__False oh ok
__label__False that s probably better yeah s scratch my other idea
__label__False ok and you were saying something starting to say something else about your your class project or
__label__False he he
__label__False uh
__label__False i see that oh yeah
__label__False no no
__label__False so i think having a good tool is worth something no matter what
__label__False yeah
__label__False the new disk are installed if you need space just let me know i have to create the p appropriate subdirectory so we re s kinda trying to keep even the scratch one we re keeping a little organized where we put a y a u doctor speech data and then
__label__False this is transcript l two nine five nine three five eight four two o six six nine three zero three nine four o eight eight five eight five one o seven four s five six one five four one six six one two five two seven eight five nine eight four two three five nine nine o seven two nine six three two zero one one one eight five five o one eight one one six eight three six eight nine six
__label__False cool
__label__False maybe those they re so
__label__False alright
__label__False something like that
__label__False yeah
__label__False the connector that sony ha that uh
__label__False no their filter is not m domain
__label__False they i mean i it s more or le the same principle a these other mike are built under it s just that there s le quality control
__label__False no just write it down
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah it s quite complicated
__label__False yeah
__label__False and u i think routinely they would not do this
__label__False well two to the power of the number of neuron
__label__False ok but to to check this for uh thing that they re worried about having said or if they re willing to just send an approval of it at from their memory
__label__False is too high
__label__False so i i i actually think that paper is the more universal thing
__label__False already
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i think it s it s five frame but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True i m hoping espen will do it
__label__False i do nt know say they discussed the admission fee
__label__False no with doctorspeech it s just a group
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah super super
__label__False oops
__label__False it wa true on uh tidigits but it s not true on italian
__label__False excuse me
__label__False mmm
__label__False i ll be in touch thanks
__label__False so that we can label it i mean that s how we get a corpus that we can label
__label__False we could but then that start getting pretty long
__label__False it s the same uh aurora noise uh in all these case for the training
__label__False it s like yawning
__label__False just before
__label__False i do nt know any
__label__False yeah i the clean speech the codebook for clean speech i am using timit
__label__False data
__label__False right and you recommended using the one with two s maximum of two second but two s
__label__False but uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but that wo nt work because it s
__label__False i guess i do nt see having a few phrase here and there in a meeting being that mu much of a headache bleeped out so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm yeah
__label__False well i know well that s true i mean
__label__False yeah that s
__label__False um but again jerry is jerry s open so i mean we have two speech meeting one uh network meeting uh jerry wa open to it but i i s
__label__False yeah
__label__False but
__label__False it it wa part of these result
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it ll only be a problem for m for mine
__label__False right
__label__False that wa the initial one that we found
__label__False or like it developmental state or something like that you could i guess you could get that
__label__False p so
__label__False right exactly
__label__False yeah like the entropy of the the output or
__label__False we could pay subject
__label__False yeah
__label__False is cv like yeah just keep the lock on
__label__False did you ever get to look at the the rou paper that i sent you on the on that problem in english and german
__label__False by next friday
__label__False so i think you know we need to choose the choose the experiment carefully so we can get uh key key question answered uh before then and leave other one aside even if it leaf incomplete table someplace uh uh it s it s really time to time to choose
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i think that s a a good idea you know there s also the e in my mind
__label__False nuh
__label__False so but those are all easy thing right
__label__False i did the experiment on the sri frontend where i tried the y where the standard used to be to use trapezoidal filter
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False remember to read the transcript number please
__label__False meeting recorder data issue or recognition this week
__label__False ok so i think what i m what i saw in your smaller chart that i wa thinking of wa wa there were some number i saw i think that included these multiple language and it and i wa seeing that it got worse
__label__False the program is training maybe for this weekend i will have result tidigits and i can complete that s like this
__label__False yeah
__label__True are we meeting in here probably or ok
__label__False well it s very tricky
__label__False yeah
__label__False yea actually the left edge of the first filter is at sixtyfour so
__label__False that s interesting
__label__False um so we have you know some kind of little something and uh we have a wireless connection this board that s doing the computation for the f the uh the recognition
__label__False so
__label__False send it via email
__label__False well no ok the question i still have about what we re going to do is what is what eh ok so we can get the equipment set up so that basically we re in a situation where we can with you know ten minute of preparation we can bring nine people in here and do a multi channel recording
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False on tidigits this matter
__label__False oh so tha that s what i meant it just some user like meetingroot or something
__label__False and people often work on new standard while an old standard is in place and so on
__label__True that s when i m meeting with wolfgang wahlster to sell him this idea
__label__False well they do nt speak such clear english
__label__False i thought somebody had yeah that s right
__label__False i saw something about uh that looked like it wa doing something like that but i did nt quite understand it
__label__False you do nt necessarily know what
__label__False actually i think that that last one i just said we could do fairly quickly so why do nt you you start with that
__label__False i mean one of the thing i wanted to do uh that i i talked to to don about is one of the possible thing he could do or m also we could have someone else do it is to do block echo cancellation to try to get rid of some of the effect of the the the farfield effect
__label__False like for clean clean training condition
__label__False um so you are already in that recognizer doing something that is likely to affect uh the the farfield microphone uh formant so it may not
__label__False so and uh this wa the one also that wa uh
__label__False the third test is by using um the three language database and the fourth is
__label__False now eh doe one one issue one issue with with that is that um the system ha this uh notion of a speaker to which is used in adaptation variance norm uh you know both in uh mean and variance normalization and also in the vtl estimation so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False there wa a there s actually a word for uh it s not just breathing but all kind of mouth uh mouth mouth stuff
__label__False no it doe nt no
__label__False so performance went down
__label__False ok let me know
__label__False almost when
__label__True actually uh have um also we can uh start looking at the smartkom table and i will
__label__False so then the hidden variable hair variable we came up with were whether someone wa on a tour running an errand or whether they were in a hurry because we were thinking uh if they were in a hurry there d be le likely to like or th
__label__False and i m yeah i m i m inventing context which are maybe unlikely but yeah i mean like but it s still the case that um you could you could override that default by giving extra information which is to me a reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of ok they really want to know if there s a bakery around here which is direct
__label__False ok my preference is to have a single procedure so that i do nt have to think too much about thing
__label__False that sound good
__label__False i really wa nt even gon na play with that part of the system yet i wa just gon na change the the t yeah just look at the length of the model and just see what happens
__label__False very exciting
__label__False mayb yeah
__label__False it s in the these these these plan schema
__label__False doe matter for them
__label__False so it s not very consistent
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False great
__label__False i think that um
__label__False hmm
__label__False oh
__label__False we ll make them zero for now because it who who know what they come up with what s gon na come in there
__label__False and uh
__label__False yeah but it s not a clean case it s a noisy case but uh training and test noise are the same
__label__False but uh just to to um
__label__False could we do exactly the same thing that we re doing now but do it with a farfield mike
__label__True she s on the email list right
__label__False for the uh node that are observable
__label__False r uh sure
__label__False and and y you would nt like that to be the case
__label__False i m the the abstract idea being i am a tourist i want to go to this place
__label__False no
__label__False yeah yeah so it s it s a weight on the ball spectrum
__label__False yeah
__label__False and it is the same grammar
__label__False f right and uh he doe nt have to have hard label
__label__False did nt take a vote ok
__label__False five zero nine one nine five three four two six five six
__label__False do you know who wa who wa since we were nt in on it uh do you know who wa in from ogi wa wa wa hynek involved or wa it sunil or
__label__True i do nt know the meeting in is the five and six of december
__label__False god
__label__False robert s gon na pick a piece of this space
__label__False but i you know i we can something
__label__False ok
__label__False um let s see
__label__False actually no you do that before you merge the various channel so you you id identify by some criterion which is pause length you identify the beginning and end of these spurt and you put another set of tag in there to keep those straight
__label__False hmm
__label__False and then he ch you choose optimal splitting
__label__False joe s uh think suchandsuch about about this field but i think he s wrongheaded
__label__False because um eml is building up a huge thing in leipzig
__label__False oh oh i see i see
__label__False right
__label__False so i take it that wa similar to the what what we did for the parsing
__label__False do sh can i say or or is that just too sensitive
__label__False i guess it would be the same
__label__False hopefully
__label__False i think that s bergen chang something or the other
__label__False oh ok
__label__False i i think
__label__False that s interesting
__label__False i mean we have to be careful cuz we have nt gotten a good result yet
__label__False right
__label__False y yeah it s sort of
__label__False so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False not metaphorical
__label__False well i mean let s see
__label__False disaster
__label__False um and the only problem with that is that there s a bug in
__label__False uh i ll also get rid of this click to add note
__label__False yeah did it
__label__False oh
__label__False i mean that they re s probably working with fixed point or integer or something i think you re supposed to on this stuff anyway and and so maybe that put it in the right realm somewhere
__label__False sorry
__label__False so i m sorry i missed that what s mf m and me
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False do that yeah
__label__False what i m what my job is i will um give you the input in term of of the internal structure maybe node by node or something like this or should i collect it all and
__label__False forced action or forced motion
__label__False well yeah but i mean the uh i mean that s what the construction parser would do uh i mean if you said something completely arbitrary it would f find the closest construction right but if you said something that wa completel er h theoretically the construction parser would do that
__label__False babble
__label__True and um you re gon na be around t again always tuesday and thursday afternoonish
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh
__label__False and the other stream is the output of a neural network using a input also these um cleaned
__label__False the idea is so imagine we have a library of schema such a the sourcepathgoal and then we have forced uh motion we have cost action we have a whole library of schema
__label__False yeah that s true i ve noticed that yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you know how they get autofills i guess or whatever you call it
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean i it s just their repair shop
__label__False th that s an a side of style a style that we re not collecting here so it d be great
__label__False oop
__label__False but they are channelized one though
__label__False yeah i guess that make sense yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False yep
__label__False i ll probably be here
__label__False just for correction
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean you guy should probably meet and maybe barry barry will be around and and then uh uh we ll start up again with
__label__False but typically a person ha to uh mediate you know which change actually get go through
__label__False uh if we use the the old lda filter i mean the lda filter that wa in the proposal we have like eightytwo point seven percent recognition rate um on noisy speech when the system is trained on clean speech
__label__False is that good
__label__False how about we buy uh uh uh one of these high density tape drive
__label__False and
__label__False right so this would work well for uh pause and utterance boundary and thing like that but for overlap i imagine that doe nt work at all that you ll have plenty of s section that are
__label__False yeah because maybe it the same situation that the neural network training with their own set
__label__False exactly exactly i think there are enough incidental meeting for u to to do this and if we can get it set up so it is convenient enough um then you can just do spontaneous meeting a well
__label__False um yeah it s just that you re making a choice uh i wa thinking more from the system aspect if you re making a choice for smartkom that that that it might be that it s it c the optimal number could be different depending on
__label__False no de is full we must be doing it on d f
__label__False um i got this from you and then i sent a note to sunil about the cuz he ha been running some other system other than the the icsi ogi one
__label__False i gather that in these meeting it s it s really tricky to make anything ac make any policy change because everybody ha ha uh their own opinion and
__label__False and is that and tha that s changeable or not
__label__False we should do that second because liz might join u in time for that
__label__False uh i mean there are a lot of issue what s the ontology look like you know what do the construction look like what s the execution engine look like mmm lot of thing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i would like to to study if eh i
__label__False x plus n
__label__False transcript three six nine one three seven one o five six seven o six nine four five
__label__False at least it more often yeah
__label__False or being out of something a uh a well
__label__False and right now he s doing that with silence and that doe nt work with the meeting recorder
__label__False you mean that a an event also
__label__False uh and you know with these other system we we helped it out quite a bit but still there s there s something like a factor of two or something between wellmatched and mediummatched and so i think that if what you re if the goal of this is to come up with robust feature it doe mean
__label__False there we go
__label__False no
__label__False well shoot is nt that i mean that s what figuring that out is what this is about
__label__False it i but it s a state and the the issue is is that it may be just a usage you know that it s not particularly metaphorical i do nt know
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh ok
__label__False this like that and maybe here also some
__label__False and it s about eleven fifty
__label__False um and that s uh i do nt think that we can do very well with that so
__label__False well well chafe had this wor i think it wa chafe or somebody had a the word spurt originally and so i
__label__False so the next thing is um
__label__False that s good
__label__False and the transcriber tool is just not very good n at at that
__label__True you could feed it into the neural net the other thing you could do is just um p modify the uh output probability of the of the uh uh um neural net tandem neural net based on the fact that you have a silence probability
__label__False um
__label__False for instance this location node s got two input that one you
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but the idea is that u
__label__False yeah
__label__False i i do nt think it ll take too long
__label__False and then also if we i mean i do nt know what their setup is but your template idea might be a way of of of we could actually build the number into a template
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah ok um so for the past uh week an or two
__label__False the context which in this case we ve limited to business person tourist or unknown the time of day and open to suggestion is nt actually a feature
__label__False and then uh just in term of how you wear them
__label__False yep
__label__False ah thank you
__label__False i see
__label__False in principle
__label__False it may just be that they they want to have for very small energy they want to have some kind of a
__label__False uhhuh could be yeah that would be tou
__label__False yeah
__label__False the beep are prerecorded
__label__False i think they re they re they re treating it you know like uh well it s not isolated word but but connected you know the the
__label__False calendar year or
__label__False no no see
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh then everybody owns it it s the people
__label__False disk might eventually be an issue so we might we we might need to uh get some more disk pretty soon we re about we re about half halfway through our disk right now
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False do you mean if it s trained only on
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False seven
__label__False yep
__label__False it s two time actually yeah
__label__False so we have um come up with um different kind of broad phonetic category
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m making change do nt worry about that ok mmmmmm
__label__False i think i ask you that every single meeting do nt i i ask you that question every meeting
__label__False good good
__label__False oh well maybe we ll submit to s actually
__label__False yeah it it may be too it s too high in a sense like everything is more like a um flat probability
__label__False it it
__label__False um not the yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False and there s something like a median filter in it or something and uh and it s it s a linear fit or whatever yeah
__label__False um see they have th brian said the setup that they have is um uh i um
__label__False great
__label__False i mean the the classifier what were the classifier from javier or classifier from thilo
__label__False yeah
__label__False the twotwenty is one hundred millisecond for the um no it s forty millisecond for t for the uh uh cleaning of the speech
__label__False with this said
__label__False cuz u
__label__False it seems like it would for uh uh determining whether they wan na go into it or not
__label__False so um
__label__False um another one is um what what other type of structure in these multiband graphical model should we consider in order to um combine evidence from the subbands
__label__False yeah well no but this that s what i have you know started doing
__label__False mmm
__label__False is that your point
__label__False oh right so they could use the
__label__False i i have received some suggestion for change which i ve made
__label__False when when you re getting information on object so i mean
__label__False i mean i m worried if you ca nt lock a file this this to me sound very scary
__label__False you go to a smooth representation you go to a smooth representation cuz this typically generalizes better
__label__False n well i wa just aski
__label__False yeah
__label__False if you have a good alignment it help the uh th the human in in taking le time to correct thing so so
__label__False yeah uh so twenty hour but i guess the other thing is that um that that s kinda twenty hour asap because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hour the more time it ll be for people to actually do cool thing with it
__label__False another one is but the other one is the spectral shape
__label__False oh rich de
__label__False so uh in order
__label__False well but it wa an msglike thing but it wa nt msg right
__label__False because
__label__False alarm in the dog
__label__False uh you know it s a dialogue between two of you about what you know what doe he think about this and what what you know what could be done about it um if you get ten people in involved in it there ll be a lot of perspective based on you know how you know uh but i mean i think it all should come up eventually but if if if there is any uh uh way to move in a way that would that would you know be more open to different kind of feature but if if uh if there is nt and it s just kind of shut down and and then also there s probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issue will come in
__label__False yep
__label__False well um
__label__False not eva
__label__True s i ll send you email
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no science in there whatsoever but it s working now and um that s the good news so everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False there are strange strange thing happening with cone is that when you have different kind of noise the mean for the the silence portion is can be different
__label__False sigh
__label__True so let me let me make a note to do that
__label__False well we could
__label__False oh now it s out in the public this this this secret information yeah
__label__False oh so just from clustering you might be able to cluster it better because of that
__label__False yeah well it s it s not exactly the right thing but uh but you ve already seen that cuz there is added noise here
__label__False that mean the hmms we trained they are they are based on gaussians and on modeling gaussians and if you
__label__False speaker id yeah
__label__False yeah i modified it well modifying
__label__False um i ve been playing with first the um vad
__label__False and
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah yeah th that s true
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False because
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False well m maybe
__label__False um
__label__False ah yes good source
__label__False no this is fine this business
__label__False you know where could i learn it opening hour or something
__label__False then they have to be rewired though do nt they
__label__False and i think the variance is computed only from like two hundred hertz to one to fifteen hundred
__label__False and then if i apply exponential to have here
__label__False there we go
__label__False see what the length distribution is yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False but but is there is there a problem with the one hundred eighty millisecond or
__label__False hmm
__label__False so it s not the same i do nt think there s anybody recording over a car from a car but i think it s it s varied enough that if if doing this adjustment uh and playing around with it doe nt uh make it better the most uh it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set
__label__False and that s exactly what i wa afraid of
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and they used the main thing that that they used wa spectral subtraction or
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but see that would that would definitely keep
__label__False yeah we have to take
__label__False so it s two time but it includes the but it includes the broad english data
__label__False ok
__label__False if we exclude english um there is not much difference with the data with english
__label__False and i mean we ll see tomorrow you know what it look like
__label__False i mean
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah in fact you could do something like keep exactly the same procedure and then add a fifth thing onto it that had more yeah
__label__False that s pretty bad
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False two thou two fifteen hundred no
__label__False yeah
__label__False or if i did ask him he did nt reply i i do nt remember yet
__label__False well i do i see i do nt know if this is a good idea or not i m just throwing it out
__label__False yeah
__label__False one four
__label__False anyway we ll all watch liz play with the mike
__label__False because i think it s more realistic i m not sure it s a good idea but eh
__label__False there were a few people you and like three or four people who really like them
__label__False hmm
__label__False oh it did nt doe nt take well i mean a you see we have nt really set it up that well but it doe nt it doe nt take long to set up i mean
__label__False so it s improvement over the baseline mel cepstrum
__label__False like
__label__False just a drive up cachuk there you go
__label__False right
__label__False and also if you notice that there wa an extra speaker and did nt get mentioned in the key file but they were only there for a second but it s t useful to mention that they were there
__label__False ok
__label__False what
__label__False uh
__label__False ok
__label__False um but one of the difference that we found between the two system that we were using the the aurora htk system baseline system and the system that we were the the uh other system we were using the uh the sri system wa that the sri system had maybe a um hundred hertz highpass
__label__False fine good ok
__label__False yeah i i
__label__False i use a threshold
__label__True i thought he said he wa gon na i have to look back through my my email from him
__label__False it seems like it s a big part of this corpus is to have the closetalking mike
__label__False y y y yeah we end up with
__label__False maybe you can submit the digit paper on e for the aurora session
__label__False yeah that would subtract off the um uh part of the signal that were the aspect of the signal that were different between the closetalk and the distant
__label__False i mean then you know nobody win and you just use mfcc right
__label__False the whatever you uh tested with recently right
__label__False yeah
__label__False but
__label__False yeah i do nt know if i said mine wa transcript zero but it wa
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and mode is one of three thing
__label__False two two nine three nine two four four four nine three zero
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok but that s a
__label__False i think it only save like half only
__label__False alright
__label__False so i if two or more people are talking
__label__False well
__label__False go ahead
__label__False that s that s true al although you have to s do nt you have to start with a close enough approximation of the of the verbal part to be able to
__label__False so if there are in the in the hundred and thou or thousand of these
__label__False beep seven beep seven three five two i mean you think they ll we ll get
__label__True basically what where we also have decided prior to this meeting is that we would have a rerun of the three of u sitting together sometime this week again and finish up the uh value of this
__label__False and so theirs are s sort of twice a long
__label__False well i think most of the people in the meeting are the former
__label__False hello is adam there
__label__False well now it s the same
__label__False um
__label__False because the bi the beep were missing by definition
__label__False transcript l dash one sixtyseven
__label__False the i mean just more generally here if you say log of um a plus b the log of log of a plus b is not or a plus b is not the um log of e to the a plus e to the b
__label__False i did nt look uh more closely um it might be yeah mmhmm
__label__False and uh so i think when when he get done with his prelim study i think one of the next thing we d want to do is to take this uh uh noise uh processing stuff and and uh uh synthesize some speech from it and then
__label__False yep
__label__False whole utterance
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so that you bring in some information from the net itself
__label__False oh you did ok so you probably did get that
__label__False change to the data i m not sure i
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False l one nine nine two two nine five eight seven one five six nine six nine one nine five o one three zero zero one three seven two three eight three four seven two six five five three zero four seven nine five four three three six five zero zero two six eight nine two seven four nine two eight seven o two six nine eight five nine five three one eight nine three four one seven eight one eight seven six five four nine seven
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False which gave sixtytwo percent improvement right
__label__False so um i ve been uh implementing this uh wiener filtering for this aurora task
__label__False yeah the likelihood were lower
__label__False actually you know we could do that just with the tape with the current tape
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s not even really negative
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False n n
__label__False the accuracy
__label__False three hundred overlapping speech
__label__False yeah exactly i mean we uh we were getting ready to do the tandem uh stuff for the hub five system and um andreas and i talked about it and the idea w the thought wa well uh yeah that i you know th the neural net should be better but we should at least have uh a number you know to show that we did try the lda in place of the neural net so that we can you know show a clear path you know that you have it without it then you have the lda then you have the neural net and you can see theoretically so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it should be that yeah
__label__False might be might be a nice dichotomy of of the world
__label__False synthesis system
__label__False so the for so to to come full circle on that this formalization task
__label__False and so um uh it s possible that some combination of these different thing that were done would be the best thing to do
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um i think
__label__False ah the internet
__label__False mmm
__label__False but i mean it interface is not the greatest so
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False when you go to the mel scale
__label__False correct
__label__False yeah
__label__False huh that s that s interesting alright the e uh i see your point i guess i wa thinking of it a um an interesting research problem
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm cuz a lot of time they ll appear next to each other and uh i in alphabetized list they ll appear next to each other and and so it make it easier
__label__False i have um
__label__False right
__label__False i see
__label__False he wa using uh sixtyfour phoneme from sampa
__label__False yeah
__label__False three o four two eight t o o seven one
__label__False it s
__label__False yeah
__label__False let s see which one of these button will do this for me
__label__False um officially i guess he will be joining u in the summer
__label__False and
__label__False so do you maybe make error in different place different kind of error
__label__False do we
__label__False and they re each about an hour or something
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah we yeah the aurora system with the new filter
__label__False yeah well
__label__False dave ha ha promoted this in the past so i do nt think he s actually against it yeah
__label__False right
__label__False i could be wrong though it wa a while ago
__label__False mmm no
__label__False what s common is you just like do nt observe the variable right and then just marginalizes
__label__False i would much prefer to have all be automatic they visit the web site if they want to obviously they do nt have to
__label__False well i s
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False right i mean a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digit so it s it s a very different task than sort of the natural so
__label__False i ca nt believe we re using this term so i m like
__label__False st
__label__False but
__label__False so wha what is uh what s causing that
__label__False but it doe help to get the backchannels back in and thing like that
__label__False yeah so maybe so
__label__False so that s why we re not seeing him ok
__label__False they are hard to understand they re very uh out there i have no idea what they re talking about
__label__True i have a little bit of iram stuff but i m not sure if that s of general interest or not
__label__False so um go ahead ah while you re gone i ll ask s some of my question
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False oh i i am doing this
__label__False cool
__label__False but we do nt need to do that the the disadvantage of doing it this way is it s real time so you would have to sit there for an hour while it s recording
__label__False i uh had some communication with him yesterday or the day before so he doe nt plan on coming real soon but he is taking sabbatical this year and so he ll probably come for six week at some point
__label__False ok great
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think i m zero
__label__False yeah
__label__False um anything to add
__label__False more than how many overlap in your twelve minute
__label__False um yeah so it s yeah i think it must be three and a half week uh cuz july
__label__False yeah
__label__True i do nt know if uh uh we wan na uh and dan gel and dave gelbart is interested in pursuing the aspect of using amplitude a a a a a a basis for the separation
__label__False and so people can make change to their local and if they screw those up that s you know in their that s only on them it s w it s the checking in part that r we really care about and that we can control with you know who can check thing in and stuff so we can i think we can do this
__label__False right and then you have a markov model for each
__label__False right
__label__False but i knew everybody in the nsa meeting
__label__False so um
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False no
__label__True oh we should definitely get with them then and agree upon a format
__label__False that s what i thought too
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah yeah he he
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False so it wa they were s they they had twentyfour hundred bit per second but they were literally creating fortyeight hundred bit per second um even though y it wa just repeated
__label__False so do you have more stephane or
__label__False um reading transcript one two five one dash one two seven zero u seven five three nine one two zero one two seven three o four five two six nine six three nine three zero six four seven eight two o o six three o nine
__label__False that wa nt me
__label__False so it s still this kind of ratio it wa it wa getting one percent or something on the near field wa nt it
__label__False so let s say me and jane are talking at the same time and then liz start talking also over all of u how many event would that be
__label__False a cell phone
__label__False um you know sort of the canonical way of setting up a an hmm system is that you use um three state per phone and um so then the the total number of state for a word would just be you know the number of phone time three
__label__False yeah ok mine s working
__label__False well u u the one experiment th that that that i ve read somewhere it wa they u used picture
__label__False no it s not a pro
__label__False channel adapted
__label__False i
__label__False and some of the time it s going to hurt you and by combining two information source if you know if if
__label__False yeah so uh what we were thinking about is perhaps um one way to solve this problem is increase the number of output of the neural network
__label__False i understand it it s
__label__False it s an inference
__label__False ok sure
__label__False so maybe there is a way in cv to effectively lock something if you do nt want people to make any change
__label__False because it s a little bit different of the other method
__label__False that that s happening like today
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False right although you know it claim they are but probably the
__label__False eight four eight nine one one five six
__label__False um
__label__False yep
__label__False well
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False so we have a whole bunch of digit if we wan na move on to digit
__label__False yeah
__label__True but just take the best case the wellmatched uh german case after er wellmatched danish after we the kind of number we re getting are about eight or nine uh p percent error per digit
__label__False but i do nt know
__label__False right um
__label__False so um
__label__False one eight six three nine eight seven one one zero two nine
__label__False oh i see
__label__False yeah even for a wellmatched case it s sixty percent error rate reduction which is
__label__False yeah
__label__False doodoo
__label__False that s no problem but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False if you used a line out too you have to worry about if you click around and you hit a beep or something
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False but they re not very friendly
__label__False um so uh we had a discussion
__label__False i do nt know what eh will will happen with the
__label__False yeah and uh th yeah the difference between these configuration were not huge but it wa marginally better with this configuration
__label__False enter bed mn historical information
__label__False well it s yeah sort of the bre the breath noise and the mouth click and so forth like that the lapel s gon na be better on
__label__False right
__label__False so then um um you know there might be some numerical issue we do nt really know that
__label__False in the farfield mike
__label__False yeah
__label__True well there s gon na be it look like there s gon na be a noisy uh some large vocabulary noisy stuff too somebody s preparing
__label__False they were all thing that i could easily listen to and sometimes convince myself they said one thing and sometimes the other so
__label__False and
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so that mean we ll probably wan na convert all all those file filesystems to nonbackedup medium
__label__False but you could
__label__False no
__label__False it s whether
__label__False it is uh
__label__False oh ok
__label__False eh
__label__False well yeah but i mean no no paper is is a bible you know this is this is uh
__label__False i mean there are some some of them are extremely elaborate you know
__label__False yeah
__label__False and so the
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False mmm
__label__False uh
__label__False oh
__label__False because we trying a lot of s thing and we doe nt work we remove these
__label__False ok
__label__False well that s gon na screw up our backup operation
__label__False well now y i mean you could
__label__False i d f
__label__False sure
__label__False yeah no wait that that doe nt uh it s not really consistent they do nt discus the admission fee make that false
__label__False great
__label__True with hynek
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False the uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False good
__label__False sarcasm how do you how do you indicate sarcasm
__label__False so this had a lot of different stuff in it
__label__False seven eight three zero eight five eight one nine seven two eight
__label__False for the moment we do not do nt have net i mean
__label__False eh the scale
__label__False yeah actually i i wa going to say we need to talk about that too
__label__False so you have a good set of feature that everybody s worked really hard to make and then uh you you discriminately train it but you also take the path that that doe nt have that and putting those in together
__label__False right there but there s a shortage of trans transcription power
__label__False well you can go too far in that direction and you need to find somewhere between i think because
__label__False hello
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False and so there s a tradeoff because the best the best mean squared fit would be with an infinite number of knot
__label__False are we gon na look at any combination of thing you know once the net get retrained so you have this problem out of it
__label__False wonderful
__label__False how they re doing it yeah
__label__False well something using place of articulation which which lead to nine i think broad class
__label__False but so if you
__label__False wait a minute it s
__label__False it just happened to be the acronym
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and and i wa just thinking that um if it were possible to bring that in like you know this week then when they re encoding the overlap it would be nice for them to be able to specify when you know the start point and end point of overlap uh th they re making really quick progress
__label__False right so we we can do that yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False i wa wondering if it could be that we re getting more pruning
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i wa expecting th the s that these two mean help especially because of the the strange
__label__False that s but it s soon so it s g it s the spec is there and it s gon na part of the mthreel ap api filed by the end of this year so that this mean we can start using it basically now but this is a technical detail
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah that s the good thing about these pape
__label__False ch
__label__False did you find any more mistake in their table
__label__False yeah
__label__False ca nt you export c from matlab or is that mathematica
__label__False so i do nt know i mean i i guess we re assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that it that nothing will slip by
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the context we simplified basically it s just the businessman the tourist unknown
__label__False so running out of it definitely ha a process aspect to it
__label__False i wa thinking there wa on the order of fifteen hundred segment but maybe i m
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but i observe my case it s in uh uh at least on speechdatcar it doe nt matter but tidigits it s like two or three percent absolute uh better
__label__False i m s
__label__False nope
__label__False what doe it put out
__label__False so
__label__False i m sure yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yeah here
__label__False hmm
__label__False so it s y yeah
__label__False ok can we think of a nice metaphorical use of where in the tourist s domain
__label__False two
__label__False it s not one of the y it s more straightforward one forward one to defend so you probably do nt want to use it for the purpose th these are you re addressing like computational linguist right or are you
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False so it n i mean a all i m saying is whatever our input is we re always gon na get the full output
__label__False but there seems to be an actu really deep embodied neural difference and i this is um so in addition to the e
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well you you had s you said there were two thing that you might wan na do one wa rehearse your i i talk
__label__False i i mean when i listen to these thing i do nt find thing that are questionable in other people s speech or in my own
__label__False oh maybe it s the turning turning off and turning on of the mike right
__label__True what are they called what are they named
__label__False course then that s the other question is do you want binary variable so
__label__False but
__label__False uh so there are gon na be some some some thing like that which are not science but system
__label__False those are nt meeting
__label__False uh
__label__False i guess that would be reasonable
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s copy and paste from something
__label__False he s like this guy ha the javabayes guy so but e he doe nt use it so in what sense ha he updated it
__label__False you a
__label__False hi
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s hard to hard to say
__label__False transcript l dash three o eight
__label__False good
__label__False eva
__label__False no
__label__False another thing we discussed wa um that
__label__False so this is twenty or something twenty
__label__False because we figure that s about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper
__label__False it s just that right now the initialization is to stay more in the current state which is point four point six right
__label__False no
__label__False yeah it
__label__False well i mean what happens if you break one segment into two
__label__False mmm
__label__False well i think i think he is quite interested in doing it but
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah right
__label__False how many how many net do you have
__label__False yeah and this is not a crisis that i mean you do e everybody who s a student should you know do their work get their c course all in good shape and and and and then we ll dig d dig down on this
__label__False yeah that s on the far field yeah the near field s pretty good
__label__False so what would we do for training so if we re if we re training distant mi we d just use one of them
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i should there should be an l though
__label__False i do nt know maybe i do nt u quite understand everything but that adding feature
__label__False so that s why keith and i are going to be a little dazed for the first half m the meeting
__label__False yeah i i believe all that it s just
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah i mean basically it s just saying that one of our one of our best people is on it you know who just doe nt happen to be here anymore someone else pay him so so
__label__False so uh
__label__False german uh pla uh place name and so forth is that
__label__False six five one lem me do that again
__label__False from the baseline ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False so that s what s gon na happen
__label__False yeah
__label__False but yeah actually the timit noise are sort of a range of noise and they re not so much the stationary driving kind of noise right it s it s pretty different is nt it
__label__False yeah so it distort the speech right um
__label__False alright cool
__label__False anyway
__label__False well
__label__False so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False very nice
__label__False well e everything is faster than tcltk it s a string substitution language basically
__label__False oh
__label__False so we ll we ll hold off on that a little bit
__label__False so
__label__False if k if that s false query this one if that s true query that one and just basically do a binary search through the
__label__False and here no well
__label__False but that s really
__label__False well it s definitely good to have somebody look at it i wa just thinking a a way to speed up you know the amount of
__label__False that s a far a my stuff go yeah well i tried this mean subtraction method um due to avendano
__label__False yeah
__label__False well we we we wan na have them
__label__False i do nt know if he actually
__label__False um i think um it might affect
__label__False can you just do like sux or something to modify
__label__False well human are really good at that transfer function through the head and thing like that so you know even if you only have one ear you can still get get good transfer so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i mean i talked to to uh i ta
__label__False an
__label__False so every part of a structure is a struct
__label__False even though you could pick up later on just from the acoustic who you were t who you were looking at
__label__False um
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False have you also been doing spot check jane
__label__False d e s not full
__label__False yeah
__label__False which i can even email you then you know like there probably wa a little few change not a big deal
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh
__label__False and how do you determine when to to stop iterating
__label__False um i will talk about our problem with the rephrasing and how we solved it and some preliminary observation also um
__label__False yeah and then we can sort of this s instructor can say well uh then you you may want to find out how to get over here because this is where the shopping district is
__label__False i wa reading through some of the cv documentation and you can just substitute cv for your r h command
__label__False transcript l dash three five three
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False how much here would we have to reformat the drive in there to get some of the more space cuz it i mean it s a nine gig drive and there s four gig on sc on scratch and there s about three gig unused it looked like on the home directory
__label__False so they re they re doing the the vad i guess they mean voice activity detection
__label__False ok
__label__False but the question is do you average the relative improvement or do you average the error rate and take the relative improvement maybe of that
__label__False so like morgan asked about the demo status we can go ahead and talk about that a little bit
__label__False ok yeah cuz it doe nt just follow what s there it ha to be some uh taylor series
__label__False o zero zero zero seven three one two three seven seven four three two five three six one five four eight zero six six zero zero five six seven nine one nine six nine five one
__label__False well with cv though you do nt actually have to do it that way
__label__False yeah
__label__False architecturally appealing from the outside
__label__False oh yep
__label__False it
__label__False oh
__label__False in my view
__label__False uh no so if if for example the gothere posterior possibility is so high um uh w if it s if it ha reached reached a certain height then all of this becomes irrelevant so if even if if the function or the history or something is scoring pretty good on the true node true value
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False we would
__label__False so uh so where are we uh now i mean so we ve just uh we re doing this recording so we show we can we re capable of doing recording uh there s i guess a little more wiring to do or something to have to have more if we had more people participating in the meeting we d would nt quite be ready for that
__label__False yeah
__label__False four five two four five nine six two three three
__label__False i realize that um w i we we re using the presegmented version and um the presegmented version is extremely useful and would nt it be useful also to have the visual representation of those segment
__label__False well anyway the sp the portion of speech that ha have high energy are not ch a lot affected by the noise in the aurora database if if you compare th the two shut channel of speechdatcar during speech portion it s n n n the mfcc are not very different
__label__False no
__label__False hmm the first time i heard that i i thought you know the same thing and i guess you ju after a while it becomes almost a it s a bu bit of a a humbling thing when somebody say that if they get good result but we were cheating on this feature because we took it for granted even though we ca nt really assume that then it s actually the opposite it s
__label__False yep
__label__False right
__label__False when i looked i they listed one microphone and that s it a having that type of connector but my guess is that sony maybe us a different number for their connector than everyone else doe
__label__False mmm
__label__False so doe uh when you say uh so
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah maybe
__label__False oh that s interesting
__label__False so this one inclu is a longer ah
__label__False i mean on the one hand in a practical system if something is uh four point four percent error four point one percent error people wo nt really tell be able to tell the difference
__label__False yeah
__label__False um but of course if you have lot and lot of example then it can take a while to to use nearestneighbor there s lot of look ups
__label__False what doe it mean then that we have to we have an object type statue that really is an object type
__label__False i think it s a neat thing uh it seems like a good idea
__label__False right
__label__False and um they re being fed into these uh variant only gaussians and so forth and and uh so maybe it would be a better idea now than it wa before to uh have uh one klt over everything to decorrelate it
__label__False is not
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False wrong yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False and i i ve always sort of felt that that depends
__label__False tsk hhh yeah
__label__False so
__label__False so uh i think this will take some looking at thinking about but what is uh what is currently running that s uh i that just filling in the hole here or or pretty much
__label__False i d i d i just have the speechdatcar right now so
__label__False but but
__label__True but you re are you you re not gon na be around this afternoon
__label__False but then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why do nt you tell u again about this this database
__label__False more beep than that
__label__False yeah
__label__False no
__label__False yeah
__label__False i thought you did fortyfive minute of
__label__False i mean you ve already broken them into chunk so if you have if you have a th if you have a thousand chunk then make ten thing of a hundred or or you know
__label__False uh so uh so i c i definitely have to leave at threethirty today for whatever that s
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False so uh i d be uh interested in hearing uh your thought now
__label__False right
__label__False or
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep yep
__label__False ok
__label__False so you i
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh oh th oh i see
__label__False be interesting to look at the yeah for the
__label__False you know i mean here s another argument against worrying too much about uniformity we have something like fortyfive hour of data collected
__label__False ok
__label__False ah ok so these are not
__label__False you re a may birthday right
__label__False oh
__label__False uh so that s what you were working on right
__label__False uh well there can be sure
__label__False yeah it could be uh it could be a neural network that doe voiced and unvoiced detection but it could be in the also the big neural network that doe phoneme classification
__label__False so it s twelve time nine
__label__False again
__label__False wh whatever the network guy already have hooked up for this floor i do nt remember what it s called
__label__False they have a constant in there you said
__label__False so uh you know this other one s it wa a pretty good system i think you know one one percent word error rate on digit is uh digit string is not uh you know stellar but but given that this is real digit a opposed to uh sort of laboratory
__label__False maybe they ll get s
__label__False and they re s they re absorbing the responsibility themselves so it s not it s not um yeah good
__label__False right
__label__False so it s not final even if they declared a standard
__label__False right
__label__False i see
__label__False this is the first try i mean i maybe the lda s not very useful then
__label__False hmm
__label__False that s better
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and you can
__label__False ok
__label__False nine o one eight three two two six two three
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the speechdatcar is more uh sort of roughly stationary a lot of it and and tidigits maybe is not so much a yeah
__label__False it s timit with noise
__label__False i had nt really thought of it but
__label__False no
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah it s not
__label__False al
__label__False mmm yeah
__label__False i i think he s at least planning to do it for the cl closemike crosstalk and so maybe i can just take whatever setup he ha and use it
__label__False oh
__label__False uh one two
__label__False that
__label__False i know
__label__False y yes i mean s when i came up with the original data suggested data format based on the transcription graph there s capability of doing that sort of thing in there
__label__False j t liz you wan na talk about recognition thilo you wan na talk about recognition
__label__False i do nt know exactly how they are obtained
__label__False so this is just a specification of all the possible input
__label__False yeah that s right yeah that s right
__label__False yeah i mean t y i wa thinking th the other day that this is not just conversational speech the fact that is ha so much technological jargon in it i it make it u considerably harder to um me e e e to transcribe and to to double check and all those thing so
__label__False i do nt understand also what is what is the difference between asp and uh baseline over
__label__False it s a painful painful microphone
__label__False yeah it depends
__label__False yeah
__label__False and then it pass the tree onto uh the ge the generation module
__label__False the target for the neural net uh they come from forced alignment
__label__False le let s talk about it because that s that s something that i i know andreas is le interested in than liz is so you know
__label__False right
__label__False hello
__label__False so
__label__False ye ye you prefer eh to eat eh chocolate eh at the coffee break eh at the
__label__False and that worked that worked fine
__label__False then there is also the possibility remember in cv when we talk about making change there s sort of two type that can be made to your local or to the global
__label__False two two nine three three one two eight
__label__False transcript l dash one one two zero seven eight seven six two one six four six five three one two five eight four seven seven two seven zero six three six three four seven nine seven six five two nine nine three two seven three two nine nine nine three eight nine one four one seven six o four four zero zero eight six seven four five eight zero six six three five nine seven seven seven seven three five five three two four five zero eight
__label__False oh but you d have the
__label__False i m sorry one o three one four o four seven five seven three six nine six five seven eight
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so topic number one is we got the nsf atr itr excuse me which wa originally pretty big but it s divided among many site and they like cut the budget by a th by two third
__label__False yeah so i ve i
__label__False test ok i guess it s alright
__label__False and i m only get two channel and there re a bunch of
__label__False oh ok
__label__False well all th all three of you
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False i d like a burger with that do you want fry with that
__label__False iram
__label__False yeah
__label__False he s facing this way
__label__False yeah
__label__False if we put everything we improve a lot u the spectral use of the vt but the final result are not still mmm good like the
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s multilingual
__label__False yeah
__label__False and with the current weighting i think it s sh it will be better because the wellmatched case is better
__label__False it s possible yeah
__label__False there re some who have more hour that they devote to it than others yeah
__label__False but the latency but you ve got the latency shorter now yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False and how do you handle it in the language model
__label__False it is an interesting idea if we could build an adaptor that went from cuz i think mine look like this too if we had this style plug that went to that then we d just have adaptor and people would plug them in
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i think when w you you could do it in this way that you say if you if i m you have somehow a noise estimate and if you say i m i m with my envelope i m close to this noise estimate then you have a bad signaltonoise ratio and then you you would like to have a stronger smoothing
__label__True i think the most important thing is morgan wanted to talk about uh the arpa demo
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i agree right right
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False two
__label__False yeah
__label__False so it s like a scale probability value
__label__False if someone else
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False i mean a shorttime fft shorttime cepstrum calculation uh mean u mean calculation work that people have in commercial system they do this all the time they the they calculate it from previous utterance and then use it you know but but uh a you say there ha nt been that much with this long longtime uh spectrum work uh
__label__False ok
__label__False well
__label__False ok we re done
__label__False so maybe we should do another number list and
__label__False um no i
__label__False ok
__label__False sure
__label__False hmm
__label__False now this is the and then
__label__False hugin
__label__False they d make use of of what you ve done
__label__False i think they would
__label__False but they have nt gotten to the end of that yet so they re still working some of them are two of them are still working on completing that
__label__False the system breaking
__label__False yep
__label__False and what you were using before wa scaling factor that were just from the the m the sri frontend
__label__False uh more actually if i
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so i definitely wa nt pausing enough between them
__label__False yeah
__label__False actually jane is right like in conversation analysis i ve never heard people use this because they re not using an automatic system so it really
__label__False oh no
__label__False although that ha nt shown to make a big difference
__label__False wish you a good trip
__label__False yeah
__label__False and andreas ha the last word
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False the other thing is that and and
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh ok
__label__False right but my point wa you know if it s a big difference to me if there s a thousand or there s a hundred if there s a thousand then that mean that this is only happening three time out of a thousand
__label__False um
__label__True i could send brian the um the transcript i know these are er uh i could send him that if it would be possible or a good idea or not to try to do a s forced alignment on what we re on the way we re encoding overlap now
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah basically we found
__label__False mmm but i still have to investigate further i think
__label__False that s great
__label__False when is nearestneighbor good well nearestneighbor good is good if you have lot and lot of example
__label__False yeah if you re interested y you could look yeah
__label__False but it might interfere with their backup schedule eh
__label__False but uh it s possible
__label__False not randomly
__label__False right
__label__False yeah you re gon na hurt yourself occasionally by having missing the language model context but you might hurt yourself more by having misrecognitions due to background speech or uh y noise or whatever
__label__False it s
__label__False however i just got an email from thilo saying that we are ready to run
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok so so so they would g s
__label__False it s really crowded
__label__False right so it sound good
__label__False might have something to do with electricity shortage
__label__False i think tidigits is all american english right so it would probably do even a little better still on the sri system but we could give it a try
__label__False it doe nt seem to matter
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah that s right that s right that s much simpler
__label__False hmm
__label__False oh that s interesting
__label__False oh
__label__True uh we wan na talk about if w if we wan na add the data to the mar meeting recorder corpus
__label__False three four four two seven one eight two
__label__False yeah
__label__False forced motion and caused action for instance ok
__label__False well
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no no i i i do nt
__label__False i mean he certainly could use text but we were in fact looking to see if there is there is there something in common between our interest in meeting and his interest in in in this stuff so
__label__False so ch chea try to cheat in the same way that you re doing with the closetalking
__label__False eee it s in there somewhere probably
__label__False uh one two three go
__label__False oh oh i see ok fine
__label__False yeah it s like that that could r turn out to be an important issue for u yeah
__label__False promise
__label__False what
__label__False but the fifty is better than the one up above so i m confused
__label__False it doe introduce delay but they re claiming that it s it s within the the boundary of it
__label__False right
__label__False um and then there s the whole standard process which is another thing altogether
__label__False so you know it s still it s fifteen minus six
__label__False so it it it
__label__False seven o seven o eight seven eight four o two eight o three one six o five o seven four
__label__False the data we get from munich is very command line simple linguistic stuff
__label__False it s u it s using information you would nt normally have so
__label__False under window mmhmm
__label__False but there s no reason to do that
__label__False maybe somebody should tell me
__label__False exactly in the future though the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an an action and a domain object but an action a domain object and a rich action description which is
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False now i mean we re we re gon na be careful not to have the wrongheaded part in there but but you know let s say we say you know joe used to think soandso about this area in his publication he say that but i think he s changed his mind or whatever
__label__False yeah
__label__False that
__label__False we re doing well
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yeah because i did nt
__label__False i mean we we could trit uh we we could think how w what what we could try i mean it it wa just an idea i mean we to
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but th oh yeah there s that pressure
__label__False across all of them ok
__label__False um
__label__False so do you get a score for each alignment is that what you get
__label__False what day is today
__label__False so anyway i can talk about digit um did everyone get the result or shall i go over them again
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False i remember there wa this guy at atandt randolph or r
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False so the idea you had this script that you re working on to be sure that the microphone value are in are kept in
__label__False how much is built into smartkom and
__label__False yeah
__label__False number of deletion
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False oh right
__label__False no no no but you are nt necessarily giving them
__label__False and so the issue is what are some other filter that you could use uh in that sense of filter and um a i wa saying i think the simplest thing to do is not to train anything but just to do some sort of uh uh hamming or hanning uh kind of window kind of thing just sort of to deemphasize the jarring so i think that would sort of be the first thing to do
__label__False ooo i do nt like that term i do nt like that term
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False um
__label__False we can see that
__label__False per per per utterance or per
__label__False ok this this would be a good section for our silence detection
__label__False where you know who the speaker is and there s no overlap
__label__False right
__label__False are were you folk using gin that s a that just died you know
__label__False no
__label__False aha ok
__label__False but yeah i think
__label__False yeah
__label__False so yeah
__label__False well that s that s the easy one to check because we save all the intermediate model and we can
__label__False mmhmm i
__label__False but in htk what s the difference between uh a an inner loop and an outer loop in these iteration
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False and the third point um wa the um yeah the online normalization where well the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay and that s not taken into account right now
__label__False the reference drop like a very fast
__label__False i systematically add the noise but the um noise level is just some kind of threshold below the peak
__label__False i mean there s a an example or two that you can find where it made it slightly worse but uh in in all but a couple example
__label__False yeah
__label__False the problem is if it s harder for them it s also harder for me
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False because normally you would nt have that data available
__label__False ok so anyway
__label__False so they would all be yeah
__label__False we c
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s uh ranging from zero to clean
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False sharing them with the uw folk
__label__False so you know it s you you can sometimes use where f for when in the sense of you know
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False not not at this point
__label__False so if you do a forced alignment but the force but the but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistake uh or false start it s it s much le c it s much le common than one percent
__label__False yeah three people two people eh um i would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background be
__label__False since it s the same people over and over
__label__False hmm
__label__False so the plan for this summer uh really is to step back from the applied project keep the d keep the context open but actually go after the basic issue
__label__False and the the pronun the pronunciation the pronunciation are l are somewhat nonstandard they actually are uh it s just a single s uh you know a single phone in the pronunciation but it ha a selfloop on it so it can r can go on forever
__label__False or if we make it inconvenient for them to change their data
__label__False yeah
__label__False maybe another thing that uh
__label__False we just do nt know how bad it will be i mean one of the thing that dave wa noticing we were talking this morning is that i it seems like and we do do nt know this in detail but it seems like you re getting a lot from the channel adaptation the speaker adaptation and so forth
__label__False uh ok so it s uh broader vocabulary
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah so tha so we ll you know maybe you guy ll have have one uh you you and uh and dan have have a paper that that s going in you know that s that s pretty solid on the segmentation stuff
__label__False yeah
__label__False the car oh still it still uh that that s still consistent i mean i get the best performance in the case of car which is the third column in the a condition
__label__False yeah
__label__False there s one file
__label__True so let s do this and then we we well there s gon na be some separate co these guy are talking uh we have a group on the formalization uh nancy and johno and i are gon na talk about parser so there re various kind of uh
__label__False and uh it wo nt have the kind of characteristic that you d like of catching funny kind of thing that maybe are nt there from these automatic marking but but uh it s uh
__label__False whereas i took out the one that i noticed that were blatant that were correctable
__label__False while in english front of the car is the absolute front of the car
__label__False yeah well we just started working with it but these are these are some good idea i think
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False well we do nt even have it for this f you know fortyfive minute that wa
__label__False s
__label__False yeah i mean i
__label__False right
__label__False so it s sort of arbitrary i mean so if y if yeah yeah
__label__False or if even something chinese for example
__label__False you look up here ok
__label__True so it look like you have not been partaking the monday at three oclock time ha turned out to be not good anymore
__label__False it wa b a little bit worse
__label__False so in your in in the thing that you re doing uh you have a vector of one and zero for each phone
__label__False uhhuh uhhuh
__label__False so uh yeah so all the hi hm number are w very good in the sense they are better than what the french telecom get so
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah s ok that s that s a good point
__label__False yeah what happen if what we have have what we would like to have is some spectrum of the excitation signal which is for voiced sound ideally a a pulse train and for unvoiced it s something that s more flat
__label__False yep
__label__False yep
__label__False but i just wanted to say it is nt simply right or wrong
__label__False well i think
__label__False that would solve all of our problem would nt it
__label__False so that i mean that s one chunk of work and just segmenting for this is gon na be another chunk of work
__label__False oh that s an interesting idea
__label__False maybe three of those in a row and wa that three beep wa that two beep
__label__False uh i m looking for the university
__label__False ok so so do nt view free a a a absolute constraint
__label__False but channel
__label__False two eight six eight two three two five three eight
__label__False eight
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter i mean uh the the mean normalization and
__label__False that s what i did
__label__False so they are actually trying to uh fix that those value using the clean uh training part of the wall street journal which is i mean the aurora
__label__False misspelled
__label__False i think it would be interesting to find individual feature and put them together i think that you d end up with a better system overall
__label__False the the the farfield yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False also um i think that uh um we might hear later today about other result
__label__False yeah i do nt know what happened really but
__label__False no whole utterance only
__label__False we have lot o of choice of microphone so
__label__False well they probably already use lapel but they might be able to have it it would nt be that weird for them to have another mike that wa somewhat distant it would nt be exactly this setup but it would be that sort of thing and what we were gon na get from uw you know assuming they they they start recording is nt al also is not going to be this exact setup
__label__False right
__label__False i m not sure what you what you re what you get out of your system do you get out a uh a vector of these one and zero and then try to find the closest matching phoneme to that vector or
__label__False but um the trick is that the the way the construction s written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container
__label__False hmm
__label__False could we fit this deeper stuff in there or something you know what the hell we we re talking about fitting in so it s just uh in the sam same actually with the rest of u we just need to really understand what s there is there anything we can make use of
__label__False yeah or subtract nothing i mean it s
__label__False yeah so we had forty four percent in the first proposal yeah
__label__False well that s
__label__False nnn well
__label__False um it s not clear that they will keep the same kind of weighting right now it s a weighting on on improvement
__label__False the maybe the model it s a little bit different in cv when you check something out you actually create your own directory with copy of everything in it and that s what you work on
__label__False mmm
__label__False it s uh the one hundred number
__label__False i mean that s that s both you guy understanding of where we are ok
__label__False sort of between here and here so a you can see this is on one level and we are going to add another um struct if you want
__label__False you re not gon na say it s it s five hundred yard away from you or it s north of you or
__label__False you could put them at the back of the queue or something
__label__False but in in the case of the mobile uh presumably the acoustic s changing all over the place
__label__False oh that s great
__label__False yeah
__label__False if it ok so you would know this more than i would
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False uh i think yes
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False but but i would yeah it s it s easy enough to try just run it on
__label__False um
__label__False but um but it s still pretty noisy even even for a hundred hertz up it s it s still fairly noisy the signaltonoise ratio is is is actually still pretty bad
__label__False and then later you know there the we have a communication event action where we d define it down there a
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right well so you say let s say ten millisecond second for the lda
__label__False yeah that look familiar
__label__False i dunno what kind of tape drive is it is it is
__label__False can i have butter on my meeting
__label__False did they increase the number of deletion even for the case that got better say for the i mean it so it s only the highly mismatched
__label__False right we discussed that
__label__False um
__label__False oh yeah digit
__label__False and with the kid in the background yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False right right
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False this is very rough but this is sort of what um johno and i managed to come up with
__label__False eight two one nine seven four two zero eight
__label__False or you can say it s silence go away
__label__False i i think s i think support vector stuff sort of go back to to that kind of thing
__label__False i mean i do nt wan na have t ha do that yet until we actually release the data because um then we have to have two copy of every meeting and we re already short on disk space
__label__False yeah so m
__label__False fiftyone this
__label__True and um finish up this bayesnet
__label__False abort abort retry fail
__label__False the idea is that we re taking le time of the linguist of the transcriber so
__label__False two eight four six four one four four six four
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well we do nt know what s it s gon na be the tidigits yet he ha nt got the result back yet
__label__False and it wa a system which used only one gaussian for silence and one gaussian for speech and now i added uh multimixture possibility for for speech and nonspeech and i did some training on on one dialogue which wa transcribed by
__label__False ok mmhmm
__label__False uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True um so we re about to collect data and um the uh s the following thing have happened since we last met when will we three meet again and um what happened is that um a there wa some confusion between you and jerry with the that leading to your talking to catherine snow and he wa uh he he agreed completely that some something confusing happened
__label__False ok you know how to do it
__label__False i mean the first thing i did wa i just scaled the noise estimate by a factor which is le than one to see if that because i found there are a lot of zero in the spectrogram for the tidigits when i used this approach so the first thing i did wa i just scaled the noise estimate and i found
__label__False twelve minute
__label__False oh ok
__label__False he s interested in these these knowledge structure inference that you draw i from
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yes
__label__False they s they say in here that the vad is not used a an additional feature doe doe anybody know how they re using it
__label__False uh so
__label__False hmm
__label__False i know where you re going
__label__False after we are done through the situation we get the user vector
__label__False the data
__label__False i guess it s for the fr the
__label__False five seven six eight nine five nine one six
__label__False right
__label__False you re talking about the type token frequency listing and i use those too
__label__True yeah i mean just ask just come by my office i can show you a well
__label__False um
__label__False if you wan na have a
__label__False u un
__label__False right so it s really it would be really easy to redo it
__label__False right
__label__False ok that wa a thought that i had at one point but then went away
__label__False yeah well i wa thinking that so it s
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm wow
__label__False i
__label__False it sounded like a url the way you were saying it yeah
__label__False or train station
__label__False i guess in most echo cancellation
__label__False oh i just uh mmm
__label__False right so that the um the uh sort of representation that you were just talking about seems more relevant to the kind of thing you would have to do
__label__False well but for a
__label__False um yeah i do nt think i mailed anybody i just think i told them to contact jane that uh if they had a if uh that that uh a the point person on it but
__label__False i do nt i i have nt the eh i i would like to to do a stylistic study and give you eh with the report eh from eh the the study from the the the session one session
__label__False but
__label__False yeah so again this is th this is the downsampling uh of the uh the feature vector stream and um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False ok so it s like in the thousand
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False um a a matter of fact
__label__False and then you extract the individual channel again but this time you know where the other people start and end talking you know where their spurt start and end
__label__False so let me let me
__label__False or you can fake you can fake name for these waveform that resemble the name that we use here for the for the meeting
__label__False well let s see
__label__False it s in in the front sheet i have like like the summary yeah
__label__False seven five four five six six five three zero one one two
__label__False carmen do you uh
__label__False in fact we could put it at the beginning of each utterance we could say beep one
__label__False beca
__label__False three five seven four two two five nine six one
__label__False the english data
__label__False it mean also we do nt have to g
__label__False so we still have to sort of look at it a little bit i mean i m sure it s been solved and i just have nt found the solution yet
__label__False the uh
__label__False yeah that s the mike number there uh
__label__False but
__label__False three five four four zero six zero
__label__False yeah i m just in progress of of doing that so
__label__False right
__label__False vad or something like that and i m trying two mlp one one that only have t three output voice unvoice and silence and other one that have fiftysix output
__label__False and
__label__False not speech not speech or too much speech
__label__False yeah right
__label__False soon
__label__False yeah so you see the pitch contour and you and when you hit play like there s a line that go through it you know and it s all aligned with like the t the audio and the feature file
__label__False and and i do nt think anybody is you know closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about thing but i think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you and and that and expected that they would do certain thing and they were sor they did nt wan na bother you and they were sort of waiting for you and and and uh we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves and they just had had nt thought of that so
__label__False ok but point three percent uh w from what to what
__label__False i can imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok i saw that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False do not do not we are not setting a good example this is not a
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok uh these are the decision i do nt think we re gon na get lot more information it s a design problem
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh great s uhhuh
__label__False node thing stuff
__label__True i can send email around about it
__label__False it s not like everything is being pinned on the evaluation set
__label__False and between now and then yeah
__label__False i th i i think that we i have the result more or le maybe i do nt know
__label__False speechdatcar result is similar than than yours so to say
__label__False two eight five seven nine five six seven two two
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s right
__label__False oh yeah definitely
__label__False at sri dot com
__label__False no transform the plp and only transform the other
__label__False you eh
__label__False two four six nine four eight eight two eight two
__label__False oh ok so
__label__False it s if you have a clean situation but you just have some delay
__label__False right so there s this this
__label__False nw
__label__False yeah right but may just
__label__False so i mean everyone who s on the wireless check that they re on
__label__False yep
__label__False sure but on the other hand if everybody is trying different kind of noise suppression thing and so forth it might be good to standardize on the piece that we re not changing right so if there s any particular reason to ha pick one or the other i mean
__label__False i do nt i will not i think investigate on the other difference which is like the number of mfcc that we keep and other small thing that we can i think optimize later on anyway
__label__False that if you just display the mix waveform and then have a user interface for editing the different channel that s perfectly sufficient
__label__False it s gon na burst
__label__False so do you have a picture that sh is this for a voiced segment this picture
__label__False seems like you d wan na do it on the fft bin
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and i d prefer it to go through me
__label__False noisy timit we have noisy timit with the noise of the the
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah that s fine
__label__False so
__label__False no
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False do we say it after we
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__True so brian did tell me that in fact what you said that uh that our that they are making progress and that he s going that they re going he s gon na check the f the output of the first transcription and and
__label__False and so i so i m i m tending to stay away from people s name even though uh
__label__False so um you were saying about the training data
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s not
__label__False uh and you can certainly play with that
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False one three five four one two two three seven zero
__label__False well
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False i dunno but it s an automatic robot so it s very convenient
__label__False mmm
__label__False i i wanted to nnn i do nt understand very
__label__False i i think it s frequent in in the meeting
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False how is he gon na do it
__label__False somewhere around sixty must be
__label__False oh
__label__False i i still do nt i still do nt really understand e like i mean we sort of say um
__label__False but
__label__False so the twelve you you it took you twelve hour of course this included maybe some some time where you were learning about what what you wanted to do but but uh it took you something like twelve hour to mark the fortyfive minute your s
__label__False but they do nt run experiment
__label__False this is the work that i did during this date and also mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False i wa starting to think of some project where you would use well similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the closetalking mike there are a number of interesting question that you can ask about how interaction happen in a meeting that do nt require any transcription so what are the pattern the energy pattern over the meeting
__label__False well yeah
__label__False and so that that s working and i think it actually look pretty good
__label__False i think it wa partly that you know give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against you know when when he he get his thing going uh and
__label__False new
__label__False xml tag
__label__False basically what this is is that there s an interface between what we are doing and the action planner and right now the way the interface is
__label__False oh no it s a g
__label__False and and but the lda is well pretty short right now yeah
__label__False i do nt know uh i mean
__label__False right so the the the role will be filled in with the schema and then what actual a action is chosen is will be in the in the action schema section
__label__False but given the limitation in time and given the fact that javier s system already exists doing this sort of thing uh but uh it main limitation is that again it s only looking at silence which would maybe that s a better place to go
__label__False mmm great
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False and we should have like we should have decoder meeting and stuff
__label__False but what is the why
__label__False yeah you do nt move much during reading digit i think
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False you ll get back another offset
__label__False yeah
__label__False we could skip the digit we do nt have to read digit each time
__label__False so we have uh
__label__False i ll be free by then
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False cuz there is one thing that we do nt have right now and that is the automatic um channel identifier
__label__False did you fix something
__label__False right
__label__False yeah that s what i m wondering if
__label__False well but no but andreas s point is a good one and we do nt have to do anything ourselves to do that they re already right now on tape
__label__False yeah th th
__label__False the uh the other thing is
__label__False so that s just my question i m not saying it should be one way or the other but it s if
__label__False transcript l fortysix
__label__False but it s very close to to cepstral mean subtraction
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we re we re still gon na try to train it up
__label__False so it cuz i mean i think this is most interesting for the mel filter
__label__False right
__label__False which is a million filter it and it creates a one hundred millisecond delay
__label__False seven nine nine nine nine two four eight eight zero
__label__False speech
__label__False cuz actually mississippi state people did use support vector machine for uh uh speech recognition and they were using it to estimate probability
__label__False i wa just wondering i i
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok so one thing i have nt done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with our full training set
__label__False i think th um we can already put them on tape
__label__False but that s
__label__False yeah right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh yeah i i really think that that s true
__label__False yeah but we believe that all the decision node are can be relevant for the whereis and the where howdoigetto or the tellmesomethingabout
__label__False but eh anyway thank you thank you very much eh i i bring the chocolate eh to to tear uh with with you uh
__label__False what do you think about that bhaskara
__label__False well france telecom wa wa wa very short latency and they had a very good result
__label__False mmm
__label__False right
__label__False we we strip away a lot of the markup uh in the transcript which you know is nt relevant to the scoring of the speech recognition output so
__label__False uh i think
__label__False well i m
__label__False ciao
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so let s see
__label__False you would think that would fairly trivially the training would anyway th the testing uh i do nt i do nt think would parallelize all that well
__label__False i wa curious because the way that they train up the model they go through about four sort of round of of training and in the first round they do uh i think it s three iteration and for the last three round e e they do seven iteration of reestimation in each of those three
__label__False well
__label__False well
__label__False x is equal i is equal to log of uh mmm
__label__False yeah we ll so we ll see uh maybe
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s just the rest of the digit the rest of the digit are very clean um without a lot of background noise so i m just not sure
__label__False yeah
__label__False we do nt need a powerful machine to do these thing right so one of these old
__label__False we can talk about it later
__label__False yeah right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False this is lem me ask a q more basic que i mean is this uh uh iterative
__label__False yeah he s gone now
__label__False um a number of people have done this so that say if you re talking to a speakerphone uh it make it more like it would be if you were talking right up to it
__label__False right
__label__False yes they wear the head
__label__False uh and her name is eva
__label__False so it ll go down to uh to the natural log being
__label__False would that
__label__True and plus all of u
__label__False so we got back the ibm transcript and the accuracy look ok there are i mean there are area which are clearly wrong and there are a lot of area where they put question mark where the acoustic were nt very good and i think that s fine putting it in question mark is better than doing it wrong
__label__False but i mean in the practical sense it s impossible
__label__False but you know
__label__False no offense like
__label__False latency is short is yeah
__label__False you could imagine that
__label__False um and um
__label__False i think it s a little bit more complex
__label__False alright
__label__False so the idea wa that what he wa going to be doing wa experimenting with different measure such a the increase in energy such a the energy in the lpc residual such a i mean there s a bunch of thing
__label__False and then uh
__label__False hmm
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False but it s not pejorative towards the data it s pejorative towards
__label__False um so i i do have a a an agenda suggestion
__label__False yeah
__label__False plus the frame so it s twotwenty
__label__False yeah something happened i do nt know what but he s on it now
__label__False no
__label__False yeah
__label__False the
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah we have our codebook with different density gaussian
__label__False and just make it l
__label__True major and um just sending the the little writeup that we did on to those email list uh
__label__False but of course to get zero and o s distinguished we you have to do it
__label__False well we could just
__label__False ok
__label__False if person x
__label__False i just wan na mark that you did not read digit
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah so but in this case i i really expect that maybe the the two these two stream of feature they are very different i mean and maybe we could gain something by combining them or
__label__False number four
__label__False i yeah have i have
__label__False so all the all the form are now on the computer
__label__False the origin yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s
__label__False for the tandem net you mean hmm
__label__False right
__label__False yeah um well the search for the middle layer it s basically uh talk about uh it just refers to the fact that uh one of main thing we had to do wa to decide what the intermediate sort of node were you know because
__label__False absolutely
__label__False the combination i see
__label__False hmm
__label__False and uh you should see uh a gentle degradation through that
__label__False then the issue of of being able to trace joe because we know he s wellknown in this field and all this and and tie it to the speaker whose name wa just mentioned a moment ago can be sensitive so i think it s really really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention name any more than we have to because if there s a slanderous aspect to it then how much to we wan na be able to have to remove
__label__False this is still something that yeah we do nt know
__label__False eight five eight two seven five three two
__label__False ok great well thanks a lot that s really great
__label__False yeah and uh
__label__False ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False oh you had the sa same answer anyway
__label__False yep
__label__False i mean the the way we we do it now is that we have a neural network and basically the net network is trained almost to give binary decision
__label__False yeah the log energy versus czero
__label__False yeah
__label__False the grouping
__label__False so what happened to is it st possible at all to display the word in their aligned location
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yeah um
__label__False ok so nice wall is a stand in for like architecturally it uh significant or something like that
__label__False yeah
__label__False this is construal and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that ha some general domaingeneral rule how thing are construed and then the idea is to use ontology situation user and discourse model to instantiate element in the class of the probabilistic relational model to do some inference in term of what is being construed a what in our beloved tourism domain
__label__False right
__label__False for the meeting
__label__False no i mean if suppo i i assume you also changed some boundary right
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False absinthe i think also he ha sort of been involved in a lot of those thing yeah
__label__False i mean increased energy is is sort of an obvious one yeah um and uh it s not obvious i mean you could you could do the dumbest thing and get get it ninety percent of the time but when you start going past that and trying to do better it s not obvious what combination of feature is gon na give you the you know the right detector so the idea is to have some ground truth first
__label__False ok
__label__True though i do nt remember email on that so wa i not in the loop on that
__label__False and probably there is much more between class error for noisy speech
__label__False what we re missing are the these where arrow are pointing where we re combining top one
__label__False so is there something quick about absinthe that you
__label__False yeah so i do nt you know how to interpret that but mmm
__label__False mm hmm
__label__False dave
__label__False maybe part of it
__label__False right right f so for every phone there is there is a um a vector of one and zero f uh corresponding to whether it exhibit a particular phonological feature or not
__label__False i ha
__label__False ok
__label__False yep
__label__False well yeah i just do nt know if this is th l what the doe this is what java bayes take a a
__label__False yeah so let s talk about the digit since they re not here yet
__label__False uh i i do nt remember but there wa there wa a significant um loss or win from adaptation with with adaptation
__label__False and you have to do something if you get these negative value i mean this is your noise estimate and you somehow subtract it or do whatever uh and then you have
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False which i ll hopefully sort of scrape together t
__label__False well
__label__False um so that wa one big factor that helped improve thing and then the other thing wa that you know a liz said the we f enforce the fact that uh the foreground speech ha to be continuous it can not be you can not have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech you can only have background speech at the beginning and the end
__label__False so we need to combine these two
__label__False but you can check
__label__False um then modeling there it is
__label__False oh ok
__label__False sure
__label__False seven five six two six nine three three four four
__label__False one thing uh
__label__False you would nt like that a soon a you step outside
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean so we can go microphone shopping and get get more microphone it s just w
__label__True do you mean eh but you i mean mar you mean when wa wa mark randolph there or
__label__False so
__label__False actually
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s better to use clean
__label__False what i ve been doing is uh trying to figure out it just seems to me like there s a um well it seems like there s a bug because the difference in performance is it s not gigantic but it s big enough that it it seems wrong and
__label__False transcript nine five one nine seven zero nine
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that s
__label__False no we do nt have any data with background eating
__label__False i i already adjusted this a number of time i i ca nt quite seem to
__label__False right
__label__False i just put a median filtering on this to smooth the probability right
__label__False it s just ng yeah yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok what do you want
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False and then
__label__False so what i d been trying wa um uh
__label__False well i think we should
__label__False so that would be origin in english right
__label__False what s going on at the end of the tool yeah
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False he s try no he s trying to get good recognition performance
__label__False well
__label__False i have the result eh of the study of different energy without the law length
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False do we have an attribute for noninteractive machine
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so b speaking of linux so
__label__False yeah
__label__False year or two
__label__False greettheperson goal so it just start uh it bind some variable and it just decides to you know do some subscold basically it just mean build the tree
__label__False hmm
__label__False cuz you re gon na get you know if i i m i m in a bunch of meeting and i do nt wan na get a stack of these i wan na just be able to go to go to the web site and visit it a i want
__label__False no this is the twentyfirst
__label__False actually i think of cheating a a way to do some work where you ca nt address all of the computational task like if we wan na study um speaker habit but we ca nt do speaker detection but we wan na assume let s say we know this is jane and we know this is chuck even though automatically to look at the habit we would need to also first figure that out but we can sort of cheat on that factor because it s somebody else s research and then we just
__label__False me too
__label__False ok we can talk more about it later
__label__False uh second thing is the initialization of the stuff actually uh what we were doing is to start the recursion from the beginning of the utterance
__label__False yep
__label__False they all need some some noise noise spectrum but they use every all use a different one
__label__False um so
__label__False yeah
__label__False well but but
__label__False yeah so far it s been pretty good
__label__False what is the s oh
__label__False ye
__label__False after i just printed out a zillion of them
__label__False the the basic u um idea behind the uh data collection wa the following
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False so then it s t uh tandem experiment after that
__label__False sri recognition oh
__label__False well i mean we have we are transferring the vad to the backend feature to the backend because we are dropping it at the backend after everything all the feature are computed so so the neural so that is coming from a separate neural net or some vad
__label__False ok
__label__False but you know th
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh but if it s low energy and the spectrum look like that it s probably unvoiced
__label__False yep
__label__False ah
__label__False could be
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False i guess it the begs the question of what is the meeting corpus so if at uw they start recording twoperson hallway conversation is that part of the meeting corpus
__label__False in this system or in r
__label__False yeah
__label__False i just did nt wan na go by you if you had something
__label__False any agenda item today
__label__False no
__label__False yeah
__label__False and uh
__label__False so we will try it ll probably be a little late but i m gon na try it
__label__False well the other thing you can
__label__False um actually we do nt have any model um you can
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False and i for i m not sure what attribute we attach to the sunbladeonehundreds but it could be sbonehundred and so if you query for f all machine that have that attribute then you should see the name of the new machine but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right why a actually uh the thing is you you do but th the thing you have to im implement is so small that
__label__False uh i wo nt it s probably four because of is it three let s see twentythird thirtieth sixth that s right next three
__label__False ok right
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False so we had reached the point where we had reached the point where um on the male portion of the development set the um or one of the development set i should say the um the male error rate with uh icsi plp feature wa pretty much identical with uh sri feature which are mfcc so um then i thought oh great
__label__False alright
__label__False it seems quite robust to noise so when we take we draw it parameter across time for a clean sentence and then nois the same noisy sentence it s very close
__label__False right
__label__False so
__label__False yeah and wha what i observed is that for italian and spanish when you go to thirty and twentyfive db uh it it s good it stay in this range it s uh the p u well the performance of the this algorithm is quite good but for finnish you have a degradation already when you go from thirtyfive to thirty and then from thirty to twentyfive
__label__False we can end the meeting i just
__label__False yeah
__label__False but are nt we still using the uh compressed
__label__False it open the assistant that tell you that the font type is too small
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False the twentyfirst i m assuming
__label__False yeah
__label__False and of course if you have a presentation that doe nt have something that doe nt work at all then you have what i learned a a slide
__label__False y can you send them huge audio file
__label__False uh in fact the morning group is really motivated cuz they re working on connected digit so it s
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False meeting recorder
__label__False so i mean i think they ll be inter i ll be interested in all this but but uh probably if we had to pick something that we would talk on for ten minute or so while they re coming here or i guess it would be you think reorganization status or
__label__False um
__label__False yep
__label__False eightynine fortyfour
__label__False right
__label__False hey i ve never done one of those no
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so if you run out of cash a a tourist and and and you need to go to the at
__label__False actually not randomly we knew we knew that it had these insertion error from yeah
__label__False uh g megabyte and mega many megabyte too
__label__False that s a good idea
__label__False so this would be sixtytwo
__label__False so why save the example why not just save what the boundary itself is
__label__False absolutely
__label__False and and uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well
__label__False oh right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False people come up to you on campus and say where s the library
__label__False and that turn out to work very well on broadcast news spine those type of task where you do nt have the speaker segmentation given to you
__label__False uh
__label__False so that s it
__label__False yeah
__label__False so a seen from the church the town hall is right of that um fire station aahuh
__label__False system on
__label__False i mean many action presuppose some um almost infinitely many other action so if you go to a bakery you have a general intention of uh not being hungry
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False it s a combination
__label__True eh vectorial taylor series
__label__False uh i can i can start over here
__label__False do it yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False actually th he did a
__label__False and and i wa thinking that that might be the reason why you get these problem in the especially in the multicondition training mode s
__label__False ok
__label__False how did you get your voiced and unvoiced truth data
__label__False here obviously it s not
__label__False yeah for instance
__label__False clean training yeah
__label__False i guess this wa a little bit off topic i guess because i wa i wa thinking in term of th this a being a a a a core item that once we once we had it going we would use for a number of the frontend thing also
__label__False right
__label__False so we re s just continuing to keep aware of what the tradeoff are and you know what what do we gain from having longer or shorter latency but since we always seem to at least get something out of longer latency not being so constrained we re tending to go with that if we re not told we ca nt do it
__label__False this is being sent mmhmm
__label__False we o o
__label__False so you have bandlimited timit gave you uh almost a good a a result a using ti digit on a tidigits test
__label__False um
__label__False nice meeting by the way yeah
__label__False yeah but you might have somebody who s using it and then later you might have somebody else who s using it and so you d wan na set some yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False i i remember bb n doing this is that if you have a multipass system um if the first pas ta it take most of the computation the second and the third pas could be very very quick just looking at a relatively small n small uh space of hypothesis
__label__False but this this is i guess good news and the uh the time and especially bhaskara and uh and um
__label__False but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False eh yeah i think these mike are not working a well a i would like
__label__False just downsampling upsampling and the lda
__label__False to to look in speech only to try to m to measure these thing during speech that s p that s not that uncommon
__label__False hmm
__label__False sunday
__label__False do have
__label__False now
__label__False and yeah i i i the condition where it s better than your approach it s it just because maybe it s better on well matched and that the weight on well matched is is bigger because if you do nt weigh differently the different condition you can see that your well the win the twostage wiener filtering is maybe better or
__label__False so um
__label__False mmm
__label__False i d
__label__False so
__label__False that you will have in about nine month or so yeah
__label__False ok the key
__label__False training on a single language you mean and testing on the other one
__label__False and then
__label__False barbara told me barbara peskin
__label__False like i d look at
__label__False right
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False i do nt s
__label__False is nt that right i mean i think you re you re sort of held up by both right
__label__False right i mean in general we actually
__label__False uh but the other is that um the digit recorded here in this room with these close mike i uh are actually a lot harder than the studiorecording tidigits
__label__False the last meeting meeting
__label__False yeah
__label__False transcript two eight five one dash two eight seven zero two three nine o three nine two three seven seven four eight five six eight two eight six four nine five zero
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s p it it really is part of the jargon
__label__False um
__label__False through t to the soft max
__label__False ok
__label__False three four three zero three five four five eight four zero seven
__label__False we only did either task task data or uh broad data
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah i i
__label__False bhaskara and i did
__label__False it s thirty thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz
__label__False yeah
__label__False and i think we ll be able to do that at with this new beep format
__label__False uh the next um oh it s there
__label__False and the noise signal
__label__False right now we re we re not committed for our research to do any of those thing so uh we are committed for our funding
__label__False six three two two nine nine five four four
__label__False i do nt know it f fare for the other condition so it s just like it s like a three percent relative degradation with the
__label__False well i i think that if you run it
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah it s the same training set so it s timit with the tidigits uh noise uh added
__label__False right but you do nt want to be constantly take putting that on disk and off disk and on disk
__label__False know
__label__False yes microphone off
__label__False abbott is basically e e we ca nt add anymore disk to it we can increase the size of the disk that are on it but that will only take u so far so um
__label__False it we already have it there and it it s
__label__False right
__label__False no i
__label__False ye uh with the old older yeah
__label__False i m i m uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False sure
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False click
__label__True is srini gon na be at the meeting tomorrow do you know
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False ye yeah they they would both schema would appear so what is the uh is is there a buying s snack schema what is the uh have the buying snack schema
__label__False i mean even with the closetalking mike you re not gon na get it right all the time
__label__False right
__label__False oh
__label__False what about these
__label__False oh i i think th that would be good i mean it s not that the design of the vad is nt important but it s just that it it it doe seem to be i uh a lot of work to do a good job on on that and a well a being a lot of work to do a good job on the feature design so if we can cut down on that maybe we can make some progress
__label__False tin can
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah yeah well the beep model actually you could train a beep model that that s a good idea
__label__False yeah we can maybe write an interface th for uh entering probability distribution easily something like like a little script
__label__False right
__label__False yeah so is is bluetooth the sort of thing that d be uh
__label__False but by having them both there the fact is some of the time the discriminative stuff is gon na help you
__label__False right now we just are trying to find some feature
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False full
__label__False just
__label__False ok
__label__False is that the bud s in the ear and that the link is over it
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah now the only problem is you do nt want to ta i guess wait for the output of the vad before you can put something into the other system cuz that ll shoot up the latency a lot right am i missing something here
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False did we w
__label__False h how did he do that wh what wa his detector
__label__False right
__label__False make sur make sure carmen talk a well
__label__False rad s a great term
__label__False and and i checked them over i i i have nt checked them all but just spotchecking they re fantastic
__label__False no ok so why do nt we just around and people can give update uh do you want to start stephane
__label__False yeah
__label__False so they can they can um scroll through that pretty quick
__label__False nonvoc for doorslam and gloss for thing that have to do with if they said a s a spoken form with this m this pronunciation error i already had that convention but i
__label__False ok
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False i m just wondering when wha what it mean to fail
__label__False people probably are nt sending them you know an utterance or two
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh excellent ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False are you su
__label__False or un unknown yeah
__label__False o zero zero one nine eight one zero zero three two eight zero nine four two five four five
__label__False yeah
__label__False could happen
__label__False i wa away for a couple of day so
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh ok so then you could use um
__label__False yeah it s done now
__label__False yeah
__label__True i suggest w to for to proceed with this in in the sense that maybe throughout this week the three of u will will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different region and we make up some some toy a observable node is that what th
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False rather let me rephrase that it it can take value in the set of all verb that they could possibly use
__label__False so i i mean i talked with some people at the haas business school who are i who are interested in speech recognition and they sort of hummed and hawed and said well maybe we could have meeting down here but then i got email from them that said no we decided we re not really interested and we do nt wan na come down and hold meeting
__label__False so anyway uh but uh she s another one of these one with a three point nine average and so forth and so on
__label__False and then school will start in in the sixt on the sixteenth some of them will have to cut back their hour at that point but
__label__False ah
__label__False that s uh
__label__False i mean is there i know this sound tough but we ve got the room set up um
__label__False uh against all tradition
__label__False i think even before you give this to wahlster uh you should
__label__False just ha uh trying out the alignment procedure that you have on that you could actually get something um uh uh get an objective measure
__label__False right
__label__False yeah this for timit
__label__False in order to cut them out we d have to listen to it
__label__False and the transcriber here are still uh are working though
__label__False yeah it wa it wa slightly worse um
__label__False so
__label__False and so these log probability they are nt directly comparable because you have a different normalization constant for each model you train so
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah and i have nt tried using that it would probably help the program that i m doing to first feed it through that
__label__False so until then
__label__False so uh this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close closemiked uh case um we d like to be able to have um other sound from other people and so forth removed from so when someone is nt speaking you d like the part where they re not speaking to actually be
__label__False um
__label__False and there s something a final thing that you run and it accumulates all the count together
__label__False it s just like defined by the acoustic
__label__False one four seven four four nine two seven eight
__label__False so be interested in hearing
__label__False one nine one six five four eight four three one
__label__False i do nt know if this answer your question i wa just staring at this while you were talking sorry
__label__True maybe you have to standardize this thing also noise estimation because all the thing that you are testing use a different
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ugh
__label__False mmhmm so the speech recognizer also work uhhuh
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False these are next week
__label__False uh s so barry if you just have zero and one how are you doing the speech recognition
__label__False play the audio corresponding to that um um feature file and it s all like aligned and stuff
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False some people are arguing that it would be better to have weight on uh well to to combine error rate before computing improvement
__label__False two s
__label__False so that threshold ok
__label__False and everything else wa sorta committed
__label__False it s a speechact
__label__False yeah maybe is nt the right thing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True tuesday and thursday
__label__False no not i mean that if you look at the individual segment from just one person you do nt see a lot of word but altogether you ll see a lot of word up there and so the reject is also mapping and pause
__label__False um
__label__False well i can stay till about uh three forty
__label__False yep
__label__False it s one
__label__False yeah
__label__False no
__label__False take advantage
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False and
__label__False yeah it just seems like you know i if it were bootstrapping or if it were i mean there are other way to maybe get the point across
__label__False yeah
__label__False but unfortunately there is like this forty millisecond latency and um
__label__False this is to get acoustic and language model training data for smartkom
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah well that we can
__label__False so we re on
__label__False five nine one zero zero nine six six eight zero eight eight
__label__False oh cool
__label__False ok ok
__label__False ok
__label__False i m just wondering what exactly did they do up in this table if it wa nt this
__label__False so a failed alignment is a very good indicator that that the word do nt match up
__label__False you know p anybody can check out the code but not everybody can check it in yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well so
__label__True i think that for me the thing that that struck me wa that uh you wan na get something back here so here s here s an idea uh what about it you skip all the all the really clever thing and just fed the log magnitude spectrum into this
__label__False right
__label__False um a third thing is um that instead of t having a fixed time constant
__label__False um
__label__False now we will try to
__label__False this is the frequency domain and we can put u that n the log domain log of x omega but well in the time domain we have an exponential
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False look at that struct in the the output even though
__label__False oh ok
__label__False but um the the total set that i gave them is twelve hour of tape
__label__False yeah
__label__False it wa it wa just it wa just unconscious well semiconscious behavior i sorta knew i wa doing it but it wa
__label__False right i m just wondering if that if if you have any indication of your standard feature you know if that s also different or in the same direction or not
__label__False where wa heidelberg um in the thirty year war
__label__False it s ok to be purist within that context yes good
__label__False and and then once you knew that then s you go well now how do i know that that s noisy
__label__False oh
__label__False and using initial value that are the global mean and variance measured across the whole database
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False but nonetheless i think if we
__label__False so right now we re using a
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah that s
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False cuz i noticed that it it help a little bit to s like smooth more during low energy portion and le during speech because if you smooth then y you kind of distort the speech
__label__False but a little bit worse for well matched uhhuh
__label__False that s why i wa going to the why i wa referring to it in a more a more uh uh conservative way when i wa saying well it s yeah it s the excitation but it s not really the excitation it s whatever it is that s different between
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False that s great
__label__False yeah mmm um
__label__True reorganization status
__label__False um yeah
__label__False well
__label__False but then how are y how are you detecting during a meeting
__label__False ho how doe it work
__label__False no
__label__False we still have nt really sat down and talked about file reorganization and directory reorganization so we still have to do that
__label__False but d y
__label__False is that better
__label__False i see
__label__False yeah pretty much yeah
__label__False it s a it s a cool idea
__label__False were those backedup or nonbackedup
__label__False i mean yeah all the l
__label__False so so like yours is pretty far down below your mouth yeah
__label__False and so all our timing wa off i ve given up on trying to do digit i just do nt think that what i have so far make a eurospeech paper
__label__False huh ok
__label__False we just compose a an output an xml me message that say
__label__False so but you know uh you can get
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False right but that s at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channel
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False when we use the network our number are better that uh pratibha result
__label__False eh and i i change the scale and we can see the the variance
__label__False yeah
__label__False when you say you do nt have a result yet you mean it s it s just that it s in process or that you it finished and it did nt get a good result
__label__False right
__label__False transcript three six seven one dash three six nine zero four five zero zero four two seven two o three eight five three o five one o nine seven one eight four seven six
__label__False we ll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not
__label__False five nine six seven two five zero six nine four
__label__False we would actually we would run some sort of segmentation
__label__False or the gateway arch in st louis so
__label__False i mean if you re only using h
__label__False yeah
__label__True you re just gon na have to explain it to me then on tuesday how it s all gon na work out
__label__False the german
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False good
__label__False we were just talking about um some uh some work that we re interested in
__label__False they they even have a reading list it s pretty funny
__label__False so again it s the silence
__label__False huh
__label__False i guess you ve got some right morgan
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False i p i think there are some
__label__False yeah
__label__False you talking about david gelbart
__label__False right
__label__False i mean it just read this right when it start
__label__False well
__label__False ha
__label__False oh
__label__False in my idea i
__label__False they re sort of separate unfortunately there s coupling between them which is part of what i think stephane is getting to is that you can choose your feature in such a way a to improve the vad
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i have
__label__False callhome then it then it really help so
__label__False mmm
__label__False right
__label__False then um
__label__False before i started working on this aurora so
__label__False yeah
__label__False if we trained the network on the on a language and a t or a specific task um what we ask is to the network is to put the bound the decision boundary somewhere in the space
__label__False uh and then there s these other meeting like hlt and and uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok that s fine yeah
__label__False i mean u u jane like to look at data maybe you know you could you could look at this format and see if you find anything interesting
__label__False in
__label__False i have to go now you can talk to the computer
__label__False oh wa it oh
__label__False just
__label__False but um you know if it s fifty thousand dollar we are nt gon na do it i m mean we have no need for that
__label__False so yeah there are two figure showing actually the mmm
__label__False that s what i wa gon na bring up
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and the the the constant in front of it i have no idea um
__label__False yeah i noticed the script that extracted it
__label__False but the notion i got from nancy s idea wa that we may f find sort of concept floating around i in the a action description of the action f enter frame up there that are e when you talk about the real world actually identical to the goal of the the s sourcepathgoal schema and do we have mean of of telling it within that a and the answer is absolutely
__label__False yeah why don why do nt we just since we re on this vein why do nt we just continue with uh what you were gon na say about the transcription and
__label__False ok
__label__False so
__label__False i think the problem wa that i wa t saying hit alt tab with the assumption that he knew what i meant
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well
__label__False yeah
__label__False is this person someone who s in firstyear this year or
__label__False seven one five six one three seven zero four two five six
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False digit adaptation
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False what wa it this this smoothing it wa over the subtraction factor so to say
__label__False i m not sure i totally understand everything that s being talked about but i i imagine i ll c just catch on
__label__False cuz i i it s cuz i do nt know what log magnitude spectral subtraction is gon na do to additive noise
__label__False there were two thing uh that they had to download
__label__False and
__label__False so so they should be right with what s on the digit form
__label__False it s hard to find anything that you say in these
__label__False well d we we do wan na have all the bug out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra xml message from left and right before you re
__label__False right but i think that if my point is i guess if you if you have a um a uh s a volume in between the two the two uh uh sensor and you do something cleverer there clearly are way to get more out of it
__label__False what about just a different headband thing
__label__False that s the next next spreadsheet is
__label__False oh oh i see
__label__False yeah the the actual parse is somewhere up around in here
__label__False alright and the other wa this question of um what i wa just talking about now so i guess that s why i thought it wa interesting
__label__False like have it we ll have it in writing so or better speech so
__label__False oh you m y totally unadapted uh right
__label__False uh one question robert when you point at the screen is it your shadow that i m supposed to look at ok whereas i keep looking where your hand is and it doe nt
__label__False and to do research on the meeting
__label__False so
__label__False oh yeah th it doe nt it wo nt leave this room
__label__False channel
__label__False i guess once we look at the data more we ll get more hidden node but
__label__False oh ok alright
__label__False yeah i that wa a particular version
__label__False well and the other thing is maybe the number would help them keep their place in the transcript and speed the process
__label__False yeah
__label__False how much doe it cost
__label__False and the first four row is wellmatched then the s the second group of four row is mismatched and finally highly mismatched
__label__False nine
__label__False yeah
__label__False well trouble is nt a container but it get constr construed a a c container
__label__True that they ll be here
__label__False now you re all watching me alright this way
__label__False right
__label__False maybe we can have him vary the microphone too or they re different s speaker
__label__False but for this it doe nt matter but uh
__label__False yeah whatever you use i mean we convert it to this format that the um nist scoring tool unders uh ctm
__label__False i if it w
__label__False yeah
__label__False i have an idea
__label__False no problem yeah
__label__False now we can put this no
__label__False so so i think using a a good aligner um actually can can help a lot um
__label__False uh
__label__False oheeehhh
__label__False i a hun uh wh what s the baseline you need to be under
__label__False p s it s like yeah it s tentatively all full yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False alright
__label__False that wa the most recent one
__label__False yep
__label__False we should con be able to conclude from that that
__label__False yeah
__label__False right but what i want to avoid is ending up with two corpus
__label__False i i i tend to agree and if it s
__label__False i think it wa a meeting a couple of week ago that we we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that s easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minute into that andreas had to leave
__label__False so that wa like one of the first l you know the first task wa getting it working for english so that s basically over now is that right
__label__False h h
__label__False well it s it s just like source code right
__label__False those two
__label__False so there is no way of telling it t not to tell u about the eva value
__label__False right what you want is
__label__False yeah the um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so i think
__label__False yeah
__label__False for instance jus just the fact that people sit in different position different time the exactly where they put it with respect to their mouth is different each time
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False so what i wa working on is um just going through and checking the header of the wavefiles to see if maybe there wa a um a certain type of compression or something that wa done that my script wa nt catching so that for some subset of the training data uh the the the feature i wa computing were junk
__label__False i think when it s noisy people should just speak up
__label__False tw twelve hour of work to to segment eh and label eh twelve minute from a session of part of f
__label__False like what side were they on or
__label__False yeah i think so too yeah
__label__False and um
__label__False hand
__label__False there it is
__label__False yeah so it s not the mel you know it s not the mel filter bank output
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean uh my my guess would be that this is since timit s read speech that this would be le of a big deal if you went and looked at spontaneous speech it d be more more of one
__label__False but
__label__False two e
__label__False throw thing away
__label__False the probability of the allophone and
__label__False uh the the prosody the discourse verb choice you know we had a list of thing like
__label__False i see
__label__False yeah probably
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh i guess we do nt know exactly yet but um
__label__False and yeah i someti are more or le similar but but are worse
__label__False there you go
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False maybe we trying again with the articulatory feature
__label__False uhhuh ok ok
__label__False right i saw that
__label__False these are the thing you want to do so they ll say well these are the thing i want to do and
__label__False you re going to sit there
__label__False yeah sometimes you you capture that when you mix it together and yeah yeah
__label__False for some reason i had that
__label__False i m not sure i think it wa about five percent error for the pzm channel
__label__True i m going to try to um create more wordspecific um uh prototype hmms to start training from
__label__False hopefully
__label__False uh yeah i could try this um
__label__False one one six four eight zero zero three four nine
__label__False hmm
__label__False have people sort of stopped going to icassp in recent year
__label__False from the resynthesis um o ok i do nt know anything about resynthesis uh how likely do you think that is
__label__False do i wan na go back to the first one ok
__label__False great
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and what we are going to do we going to and you can see here and again for johno please please focus the shadow um we re gon uh uh here you have the action and the domain object and w and on on
__label__False um uh there are there are pap
__label__False i mean so so so someone will have to go through them and listen to them and pick a place to break them
__label__False um i do nt remember there being an independent way of saying we re just gon na make them from here to here
__label__False i ve moved on now to what i m calling set three i sort of thought if i do it in set group of five then i can have like sort of a a parallel processing through through the the current
__label__False is i
__label__False cuz you kn when you said people have the same problem i thought cuz my h go after the uh e e e the v
__label__False so did they actually save the farfield data cuz at first they were nt they were nt sa ok
__label__False yes
__label__False no this way yeah
__label__False you find stretch where the combination of the frame wise vad and the the median filter say that there s a stretch of silence
__label__False so it wa
__label__False digit on another language
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False oh that s right
__label__False that s what i m just thinking one of the big difference with broadcast news and these meeting is we have m many fewer participant
__label__False oh
__label__False oh i ve forgotten now um
__label__False i guess they are evenly weighted
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah but i do nt i m not
__label__False yeah i mean it seems like uh it should include sort of the current state of the art that you want are trying to improve and mfcc s you know or plp or something it seems like reasonable baseline for the feature and anybody doing this task uh is gon na have some sort of voice activity detection at some level in some way they might use the whole recognizer to do it but rather than a separate thing but but they ll have it on some level
__label__False right
__label__False i
__label__False well we we have a frozen we do all our experiment with a frozen version of the transcript a of i do nt know
__label__False hmm
__label__False just so you do nt have to load up file e during the meeting
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False and eh so there is kind of of not a bug but something wrong in what we are doing perhaps
__label__False uh but you know i i
__label__False and um and fey is doing the synthesis stuff a we speak
__label__False no no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature the feature but the experiment have we have not make the experiment and maybe will be good result or bad result we do nt know
__label__False just a part a your process so it s i d i do nt know i i
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m sorry yeah
__label__True right so next week we uh wo nt meet because you ll be in europe
__label__False um
__label__False n uh n n n minus x
__label__False so for archiving we ll just use tape
__label__False cool
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh is that right
__label__False so it ll be a few week really before we have a meeting of the same cast of character
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False transcript l one four nine
__label__False but
__label__False location versus what
__label__False mmm this is the idea
__label__False but still finite
__label__False um so actually at some point w we should talk to user of that technology who are actually gon na be using it and see what they would like to see
__label__False hmm
__label__False it s not trained on finnish yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False uh i i have to look to see what the exact number were i i thought wa like three two two five but i i ll i ll double check it wa over a week ago that i did it so i ca nt remember exactly but uh um but it s so much faster
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um you have to make you have to make sure that in your dot cshrc um it detects whether you re running on the linux or a a sparc and point to the right executables
__label__False yeah
__label__False the edge is really uh sixtyfour for some reason uh
__label__False but they re they re mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer the you can observe that all the time they re trying to match their prosody onto the machine
__label__False cuz it s a i do nt know the method
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah they would still c sort of get the closest best fit
__label__False yes
__label__False so in a way that s you know that s sort of the dominant thing is that even say on the development set stuff that we saw the uh the number that uh that alcatel wa getting when choosing out the best single number it wa just you know it wa nt good enough for for a a for a real system
__label__False alright fine ok fair enough
__label__False well the n the new technique is nothing but the noise estimate scaled by a factor of point five
__label__False yeah but that s that s just shifting the problem
__label__False i ve if i understand how we described we set this up um cuz we ve been arguing about it all week but uh we ll hold the the
__label__False well yeah y you do becau
__label__False is it changed now or
__label__False six zero eight zero o one eight three four seven eight eight
__label__False and
__label__False um
__label__False i even think that um
__label__False yeah having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False in
__label__False i i do nt know many people who do it on cd
__label__False three right so i guess this a pretty dense group but it it s getting a lot higher
__label__False oops
__label__False cross
__label__True um by the way are do we know whether jerry and nancy are coming or
__label__False in in the upper part in the english stuff it look like the very best number is sixty point nine and that s in the uh the third section in the upper part under plp jrasta sort of the middle column
__label__False it love the tango
__label__False i i do nt know i just it d be
__label__False ok
__label__False oh yeah better do it different then yeah
__label__False yeah i ve been playing a little bit with some kind of thresholding and mmm
__label__False and that s part of this
__label__False uh ok and yeah that s that s basically the the the thing
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah so we might wan na see if maybe the low sixteen bit on the pzms are better than the middle sixteen bit
__label__False yep
__label__False four three six seven six one five two nine eight
__label__False right
__label__False well it it make sense to handle it with the same infrastructure since we do nt want to duplicate thing unnecessarily but a far a distributing it we should nt label it a part of this meeting corpus we should let it be it own corp
__label__False so there is just this feature stream the fifteen mfcc plus delta and doubledelta
__label__False yeah
__label__False and then
__label__False y do you know where his software is have you used it at all
__label__False well and then the other possibility wa e that we provide them with a a file that already ha the beep in it or something wa nt that what you said
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh it pivot
__label__False i guess for the demo you can always play just store the piece that you re gon na display and play those a separate file if we ca nt you know actually do it
__label__False hmm
__label__False for a long time we had used boot alignment that had been trained with a with the same frontend but with acoustic model that were like fifteen percent worse than what we use now
__label__False beep
__label__False i think it wa optimistic
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so we have some part of that
__label__False i actually think that thilo s n in a in a k a you know when you do the presegmenter and you and you run across trouble he he run across s some of these that are
__label__False oh
__label__False we have this no
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so it wa like uh fortyfive cepstrum plus twentythree mel log mel
__label__False yeah there s just two more uh
__label__False um nice wall is binary closed is binary final destination again yeah all those are binary i guess
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah he
__label__False right
__label__False right but
__label__False ok
__label__False weak so probably it it would do that
__label__False that s right
__label__False a what do you mean a different pause threshold do you mean a
__label__False right
__label__False i have nt done anything i wa
__label__False and um y you also did some something in addition which wa um for those in which there wa uh quiet speaker in the mix
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that s what he wa saying
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False you can look at the text file
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah w um
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False i m sure if we uh you think there s a chance we might need liz for whatever the technical side of thing
__label__False um anyway so
__label__False again
__label__False i i think one thing that s probably everybody would agree on is that there will never be a point where you know we can say that for sure there s no problem with any of the transcript i mean there s uh f you know something s going to get overlooked at some point or somebody s gon na wan na make a change somehow so we need to have some mechanism for um handling change in the future
__label__False maybe
__label__False but anyway i m i m open to c our consideration
__label__False it s probab yeah i would s definitely say it s finite
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False and we have plenty of digit data so
__label__False ok
__label__False it s kind of a useless one
__label__False i ca nt see you now
__label__False yeah so how do we do that how would we put
__label__False you wan na just go around
__label__False right
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False eight four four two three two two six one seven
__label__False so we re done with that topic
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so
__label__False um if uh
__label__False why do you ask
__label__False yeah right
__label__False what s what s on
__label__False and that ll affect whether you want to enter or you if you kinda thing
__label__False well but at ten
__label__False that maybe well it s too clean and
__label__False yeah so there are two more column in the sheet two
__label__False you certainly can i mean i y i you know i do nt know
__label__False put in put beep in a a word
__label__False wow that d also be shorter to type
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh
__label__False so when i say
__label__False you know what it doe in combination
__label__False um
__label__False right
__label__False with who
__label__False but so anyway i think that look pretty good the only the only other thing we might wan na do with that is be able to display more than one waveform
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so it wa
__label__False i did nt get a chance to fill them out ahead of time
__label__False and the and the recording also just where we are
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah so if if you
__label__False oop ouch
__label__False of the noise i estimate the noise wi well for the noise i only use one gaussian
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i mean the equipment
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True although i ve i ve never i do nt know what the light bulb is for i did nt i install that into my powerpoint presentation
__label__False so there s a lot of overlap so
__label__False you lose
__label__False hmm
__label__False probably just throw away the old one and
__label__False i guess ericsson is on the um filter bank no
__label__False mmm
__label__False good
__label__False you re online
__label__False and and then the other one is when they finish the sentence and then they laugh
__label__False uh yeah yeah
__label__False so so the key thing that s missing here is basically the ability to feed you know other feature i into the recognizer and also then to train the system
__label__False mmm no you were using gin perhaps yeah no
__label__False yeah
__label__False well if if it save time yeah
__label__False they they sheep they s they they speak cheap english right
__label__False or at least you can get clue to it so these are from the early transcription that people did on the mixed signal like what you have
__label__False so that s you wo nt be at the next three of these meeting
__label__False computation
__label__False ok
__label__False but the other thing that
__label__False if the if the neural net training were a hundred time faster you still would nt be anything running through these a hundred time faster because you d be stuck by the htk training right
__label__False right and then we then we cut it in half
__label__False uh that is an interesting point
__label__False uh bluetooth is shorter range but you could use bluetooth
__label__False i mean it s it s implicit that the person that s moving is doing entering viewing and approaching but you know the usual thing is we have binding between sort of they re sort of like action specific role and the more general sourcepathgoal specific role
__label__False so that s good news really
__label__False and then others were connected digit
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False o o one one two three four three eight six four four eight three five six seven zero four three zero zero seven
__label__False t we are we may also have to do something similar
__label__False oh i m not do i m not planning on doing speech recognition with it i m just doing detection of phonological feature
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False there wa a confusion there k i did nt intend to say every possible thing should go into the bayesnet because some of the thing are nt relevant in the bayesnet for a specific question
__label__False because if we know that enter is a t is an spg action right we know to look for an spg schema and put the appropriate fill in the appropriate role later on
__label__False yep
__label__False three two one four seven two four one seven
__label__False so um
__label__False well i ll be here working on something
__label__False so who s gon na do these backup the people that collect it
__label__False right not have it
__label__False but tha that s good to know wa thi it s chafe
__label__False s oh you re talking about backedup
__label__False the castle the that old castle one is sort of
__label__False it ha a very few at uh actually c uh tran i mean word also it s a very very small set actually
__label__False hmm
__label__False it seems like if two people two or more people talk at once it should get louder uh and uh uh there should be some discontinuity in pitch contour and uh there should overall be a um smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic sequence in the spectrum
__label__False anyway
__label__False a a matter of fact if you if
__label__False yeah i did nt intend to say that every possible ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah some latency or something yeah
__label__False now the one thing that you have said that actually concern me a little is you re talking about changing the headset meaning changing the connector which mean some handsoldering or something right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well the the office are actually a little the think of um ramp coming out of the double helix and then you have these halfdomes glass halfdomes and the office are in in the glass halfdome
__label__False you can send it to me ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah but yeah
__label__False per channel or
__label__False oh
__label__False but i do nt need it
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh right maybe you re right ok
__label__False it seems pretty fast
__label__False yeah but she knew that she did nt know it maybe it wa a technical ter exactly but she even though her technical perception is just really uh you know i ve i m tempted to ask her if she s taken any course in this area or if she s taken cognitive science course then cuz neural net and oh she ha some thing that are oh downsampled she got that right
__label__False that s
__label__False um that s difficult because um often time the the um
__label__False yeah
__label__False there s always
__label__False so we discussed about this about the um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so that s the virtual stephane over there
__label__False right
__label__False yeah i wa interested when i saw the twentyfour on there wow i mean that s probably eight bit of noise yeah so
__label__False oh yes and that too
__label__False hmm
__label__False and so uh uh tilman wrote a little tool that you could take
__label__False we re not even you know it s we re just it s not like we
__label__False the the fact i i it s sort of bothersome that you re getting more deletion
__label__False i assume they re in the pmake pool
__label__False hmm
__label__False i expect you could do that that s probably not what he s going to do on his class project
__label__False absinthe will be a good machine
__label__False and uh johno learned how to write
__label__False and
__label__False mmm
__label__False oops the mean is different with it because the the histogram for the the classifica oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False usually i i do nt know if that s always the case i i guess have nt looked at the data a much a you guy have so um
__label__False now we have to l delete that expletive
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False this is on popcorn or
__label__False yeah three right so
__label__False yeah i got confused by the result it sai because uh the meeting before you said ok we got it down to where they re they re within a tenth of a percent
__label__False ok
__label__False that right now lot of people create the file and then we have group meeting recorder
__label__False so we have to like so that it s no longer possible to just look at the node themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah i do nt know either
__label__False right
__label__False well
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm interesting
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False is nt that great
__label__False boeep beoop
__label__False so you want a more exotic one version of that
__label__False then i suggest we move on to the to we have um uh the edu project let me make one more general remark ha sort of two two side uh um action it um action item that we re do dealing with one is modifying the smartkom parser and the other one is modifying the smartkom natural language generation module and um this is not too complicated but i m just mentioning it put it in the framework because this is something we will talk about now
__label__False but it s you do nt have to do that
__label__False and so i thought about this a little bit and i think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password a single password each person will have a single password user name and password
__label__False you re saying i it s it s about an hour meeting and there were a hundred and twentythree
__label__False timit uh phone recognition with timit and um
__label__False and that s that s basically it so egocentric twopoint egocentric threepoint or you can have allocentric
__label__False what do you think
__label__False um i uh
__label__False well
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False the ok
__label__False i think he want to sorta go with the same type of machine for all of these but um
__label__False thirteen
__label__False that s alright
__label__False i i i yeah
__label__False um
__label__False o
__label__False no you can
__label__False that s my group
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False no
__label__False yeah exactly
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well i think and someone else is well how about so the word well is in this in this segment multiple time and a soon a it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who say it
__label__False and you guy will argue some more and have some probably
__label__False ah so so that mean the only thing
__label__False i guess the other thing is that um yeah i mean when you re asked a specific question and you do nt even
__label__False which i m interested in i mean that s one of the thing the whole reason i want a pda a opposed to a wired room is for spontaneous meeting
__label__False right
__label__False and so you know it s the same a source code you you release source code at some point
__label__False ok
__label__False and um
__label__False yeah a fraction of it
__label__False and and dan elli said well we re just so far ahead of the game right now we really do nt need to
__label__False because cuz the log of a sum is not the same a th i mean a yeah
__label__False i think you do care about it
__label__False yeah
__label__False i put it under the same directory tree you know it s in user doctor speech data mr
__label__False all we mean by that is that we re giving the recognizer more information than it would have if you were running it raw over a meeting that no person ha ever listened to or transcribed
__label__False yeah except they could share one
__label__False look like out of the six case between the different kind of uh matching condition out of the six case there s basically um a couple where it stay about the same uh three where it get better and one where it get worse
__label__False i have an i i can develop an expression that is
__label__False uh so it s it you have a a direct uh
__label__False that wa at least fortyfive minute right
__label__False uh i ve been trying different slightly slightly different approach
__label__False i mean the only advantage to using the longer threshold would be that you run le risk of missing some some speech right
__label__False oh
__label__False it s just hard to tell between that and just someone not talking
__label__False i do nt know wh what s the difference between tlda and slda
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False eight nine one six eight six four zero seven eight
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we well it ha nt it it certainly ha nt been observed in any case
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False uh and so because it s not part of our st of our ne needed convention
__label__False so what s th uh what s the intuition behind this kind of a thing i i do nt know really know the signalprocessing well enough to understand what what is that doing
__label__False different lang
__label__False yeah so that s good
__label__False i i hope if you need eh something eh from u in the future
__label__False uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the ve level yeah
__label__False transcriber he wa rattling the b marble in his brain back and forth just then this this
__label__False you you wan na volunteer to do that
__label__False yeah yeah i guess
__label__False because it s within reach now
__label__False almost
__label__False early june late june middle june
__label__False um the first thing is trying to play a little bit again with the um time constant
__label__False it s probably a good time to look at what s really going on and seeing if there s a there s a way to combine the best idea while at the same time not blowing up the amount of uh resource used cuz that s that s critical for this this test
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True a lot of interest actually either place dfki or uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah our yeah our
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh we kept um thing from directly affecting the mode beyond the concept but you could see perhaps discus the admission fee going directly to the mode pointing at enter right versus pointing to just at tourist
__label__False um
__label__False and you know where it s really gon na hurt somebody in some way the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out but i really think we wan na make it the rare incidence
__label__False uhhuh yeah
__label__True i forget what it ll be resource management wall street journal something some some read task actually that they re preparing
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False i consider i i the the nnn
__label__False there s like an xml format for bayesnets
__label__False training with the training test of each
__label__False six
__label__False so maybe you do nt give them access to the web interface unless they really need it
__label__False ok
__label__False i mean so there s obviously a tradeoff between the number of knot y you pick and the best fit i mean so if you re doing a piecewise linear you have to figure out how many piece you want
__label__False yeah
__label__False well actually you know there s an even easier way we do nt really need a beep model
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False sorry
__label__False no
__label__False or the intended interpretation of this yeah
__label__False it would be much easier
__label__False ok so so anyway i i agree that s not central what you might wan na do is um and may not but you might wan na this is rip off a bunch of the slide on the anal there the there we ve got various i generation of slide that show language analysis and matching to the underlying image schema and um how the construction and simulation that ho that whole th
__label__False uh
__label__False why why do nt we do that
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s
__label__False yeah so may well the this threshold is still a factor that we have to look at and
__label__False right
__label__False seven three three seven five nine zero four one
__label__False o zero two three seven three three two four seven five three o two six seven eight zero eight
__label__False i will oh yeah
__label__False so that wa cross language and the and the result wa quite poor
__label__False yeah
__label__False well in the case of gothere it would be in the case cuz if you needed an if y if gothere wa true you d wan na know what endpoint wa and if it wa false you d wan na d look at either lo income infoon or history
__label__False so
__label__False burger king
__label__False one one
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah barry s not here and dave s not here um i can say about just q just quickly to get through it that dave and i submitted this asru
__label__False well maybe you do nt
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False srt file for it
__label__False and i think would nt it be better to to have a little longer sequence for the recognizer b eh because of the language model a sometimes it happens that that it cut off within a s
__label__False yeah exac
__label__False yeah oh you ve done this one before together
__label__False uh you think that s you
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False maybe this need to be bleeped out i have no clue
__label__False ok
__label__False so is is the training data for the for this one point four case doe it include the training data for the one point one case
__label__False uh well that s um yeah
__label__False actually there are a few i saw a webbased one at one point
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok so we would then use that one too or
__label__False we collect the uh the observation from those alignment under each of the feature set that that we train
__label__False yeah yeah right
__label__False eh
__label__False uh that s that s the best thing is like the french telecom system is optimized for the well matched condition they c yeah
__label__False uh go there timing now
__label__False x k c noise
__label__False so if i m talking at you or i m talking at you
__label__False oh
__label__False well right now we do nt have any choice it r still record all sixteen channel it s just most of them are all zero
__label__False anybody know any
__label__False zero six six four two four three nine seven eight one nine five three five two zero nine four seven nine one
__label__True we talk about the the result of use
__label__False is he on the mailing list
__label__False and
__label__False ah
__label__False hmm
__label__False but still the information is relevant because it s it s information that help to discriminate if it s possible to be able to discriminate among the phoneme in context
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh yeah that s really hard
__label__False when i wa looking at these backchannels they were turning up usually very often in w well i wo nt say usually but anyway very often i picked them up in a channel w which wa the person who had asked a question s so like someone say an and have you done the soandso
__label__False i m not sure
__label__False yeah that s right
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False and and and then i guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you re feeding into the vad and feeding it into the other one a well
__label__False well yeah but i mean just in general adding information
__label__False i mean they re the most fo
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False which is th which one
__label__False uh
__label__False are we gon na start all our meeting out that way from now on
__label__False oh the thesis that s that s computa should be very computational and uh someth
__label__False hmm
__label__False o one two nine four eight five nine two two zero three three six four nine five six seven nine seven nine eight three five zero
__label__False yeah
__label__False for instance what s the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False how about you barry
__label__False and uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probability if we had uh enough data to really get posterior probability and if the if we also had enough data so that it wa representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything a hard a we can
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m just looking at a little bit on the delay issue where the delay of the system is like a hundred and eighty millisecond so i just just tried another sk system i mean another filter which i ve like shown at the end which is very similar to the existing uh filter
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh i see
__label__False do nt worry
__label__False the
__label__False right
__label__False um yeah it wa uh sonorance and he also had a paper on voicing too
__label__False bi bigram
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False now before we do that let s get back in oh but it s still i think useful for you to understand the demo version enough so that you can can see what what it is that that uh it might eventually get retrofitted into or something
__label__False uh i
__label__False yeah
__label__False n not not not really the street network
__label__False but it s a good tool to have
__label__False but walked into the cafe and ordered a drink and walked into the cafe and broke his nose that s sort of
__label__False what color wa this in in in the nain nineteenth century what wa this p instead of wh what you know how wa this painted what color wa this painted um wa this alleyway open
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False great uh
__label__False alright
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False but
__label__False the longer is better there s there s th
__label__False i see
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i sent
__label__False three nine five nine five nine one eight five one seven five
__label__False so
__label__False w
__label__False yeah but
__label__False yes do not mark any other event but only mark speaker do you think that would speed it up quite a bit
__label__False so uh
__label__False well and just you then also just have the general problem of permission on the other file that do you want people checking out a transcript file when they find an error and correcting it or do they wa do you want it to go through you
__label__False this is adam on uh wireless headset number two with transcript number five three four o six five two six seven four eight five four nine
__label__False and the problem is is that the current system doe not distinguish between go of type going into go of type want to go to a place where i can take a picture of et cetera
__label__False this is next next page hmm
__label__False no no yeah o obviously yeah
__label__False so this is a two dimensional tile
__label__False ok introduce
__label__False i ve prepared um uh a set of five which i m which i m calling set two which are now being edited by my head transcriber in term of spelling error and all that she s also checking through and mar and and monitoring um the transcription of another transcriber
__label__True so i got uh these result from uh stephane
__label__False johnson noise yeah
__label__False right yeah
__label__False right
__label__False um you mean the one due tomorrow
__label__True there s taking the result of this meeting and putting it in some kind of decent form probably getting some kind of single channel merged sum data or something so that you can give a simple sound file of some sort to a transcriber to deal with it rather than this massive thing that s a little bit of stuff to do right
__label__False same cheating
__label__False oh you re right yeah yeah yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False oh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False because you know we had talked before about the problem about using found data that that uh it s just set up however they have it set up and we do nt have any say about it and it s typically one microphone in a uh uh or and and so it doe nt really give u the the the uh characteristic we want
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so the bestcase scenario would be the number of construction or the worstcase scenario is the number of construction equal the number of neuron
__label__False you can throw the rest away right
__label__False sp digit
__label__False yeah but but i m not sure about the legal aspect of of that is is there some contract with smartkom or something about the data what they or is is that our data which we are collecting here or
__label__False please give me one
__label__False what would you say around one point four yeah
__label__False i mean if you have ten digit for a phone number i mean every now and then you ll get it right
__label__False yeah
__label__False seven seven nine two six nine four five zero four
__label__False ok
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False the input are the fifteen the fifteen uh base feature the with the new code
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so the so the the mouth noise uh word ha just a single phone um that is for that
__label__False well you might want both
__label__False ok um so yeah the this past week i ve been main mainly occupied with um getting some result u from the sri system trained on this short hubfive training set for the mean subtraction method and um
__label__False and so this is saying well if you really do have that sort of vocal tract envelope and you subtract that off what you get is the excitation
__label__False it s got what i what i think is is a good idea that i can can show to anyone who s interested we can even make a sort of an internal demo and i i show you what i do
__label__False we tried both uh currently um we use special word
__label__False yeah crosscorrelation i had mentioned this a couple time before the c the commercial device that do uh uh voice uh you know active miking basically look at the amp at the energy at each of the mike and and you basically compare the energy here to some function of all of the mike so by doing that you know rather than setting any uh absolute threshold you actually can do pretty good uh selection of who who s talking
__label__False i d prefer not to
__label__False oh sorry verb used is like right now we only have three value but in general they would be a probability distribution over all verb
__label__True ok so how about if you two guy between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal and partially question saying here s what we think we understand here are the thing we think we do nt understand
__label__False it s and and it is true that if there s two phone that are very similar that uh the i it may prefer one but it will give a reasonably high value to the other too
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False i guess
__label__False but i mean you know you can probably count count the way
__label__False but it wa all pretty artificial and and you know how often would you really try to have your most crucial conversation in this very reverberant hallway
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False oh nothing is context free but there are basic case that is um there are physical container there are physical path there you know et cetera
__label__False yeah it s forced alignment of people s schedule
__label__False ah ok
__label__False yeah i i guess what i m
__label__False that wa hilarious
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s d it s very specific
__label__False is food not allowed in here
__label__False no but he mentioned at the last meeting that someone wa going to be talking i forget who uh
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah we
__label__False you re gon na record a bunch on people in car and so forth and do these training
__label__False it s all scratch
__label__True smartkom
__label__False so i agree that if someone want to do speech event transcription that the mixed signal here i mean if i m tapping on the table you it s not gon na show up on any of the mike but it s gon na show up rather loudly in the pzm so
__label__False yeah
__label__False but with a focus on
__label__False uh
__label__False oh wonderful
__label__False yeah
__label__False or something
__label__False absolutely
__label__False um
__label__False and let s remember also to make sure that one s get marked a unread unused
__label__False ok so um for those who do nt know everyone know me this is great um apart from that sort of the old gang johno and bhaskara have been with u from from day one and um they re engaged in in various activity some of which you will hear about today ami is um our counselor and spiritual guidance and um also interested in problem concerning reference of the more complex type and um he sits in a a interested participant and helper
__label__False yeah
__label__False i i do nt think it it s just for any mismatch you take a hit i in some case it might be u better to have a mismatch like i think i saw something like like if you only have two second in test or um maybe it wa something like four second you actually do a little better if you um train on six second than if you train on four second um but the case uh with the point three percent hit wa using six second in test um comparing train on twelve second versus train on six second
__label__False uh we distend the we have the twentythree coefficient af after the mel f filter and we extend these coefficient between the all the frequency range
__label__False and
__label__False yeah
__label__False but but the people i mean a a paper that is not on aurora would probably be more interesting at that point because everybody s so sick and tired of the aurora task
__label__False mmm
__label__False well that would be good
__label__False et cetera so that s that s where this um
__label__False yeah we modif
__label__False yeah your your smoothing wa uh over this s so to say the the factor of the wiener
__label__False the issue is what you feed it
__label__False and so we we did a number of paper and talk and so forth about uh w uh i the the virtue of increasing the error rate
__label__False an another side to that is that um in principle uh if it all come together supposedly we re gon na get two um iram board
__label__False you re a geek
__label__False sure
__label__False um so when we put s some noise compensation the um lda filter that that s derived from noisy speech is not more anymore optimal
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False cuz one of them wa literally people reading a single digit
__label__False yeah that s what i wa just gon na ask how can you just throw out frame
__label__False we have such a backlog i mean to be able to get through the backlog of the of the good meeting it would be nice to not have energy diverted that s fine
__label__False yeah so it s coming along um
__label__False so you have constraint that are dependent on the c actual s specific filler uh of some attribute uhhuh
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False it ll give you a lot more data too wo nt it
__label__False the department ha many mayor
__label__False uh we re also gon na be collaborating with sri and we have their have theirs
__label__False so uh we still have stuff to do
__label__False to be allowed to record them ok
__label__False and that seemed at least in the last one a he wa just saying he he when he only did discriminative stuff i it actually wa wa it did nt help at all in this particular case there wa enough of a difference i guess between the testing and training
__label__False what is the
__label__False so um
__label__False or gothere a lot of people ask that if they actually just wan na go there
__label__False e that s maybe i do nt know
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but i think if we had some way uh some tool that made it easier to insert and delete beep it would make it a lot easier cuz one of the problem is that it take a very long time when you make a change to load it back up in the channel transcriber
__label__False zero three one seven eight four one seven eight two
__label__False i m sorry i
__label__False i mean you could just take the best system and say that s the standard
__label__False and it remind me again the highly mismatched mean that the
__label__False and then let s try and make everything better um and if one of the way you make it better is by having your feature be better feature for the vad then that s so be it but uh uh uh at least you have a starting point that s um cuz i i some of the some of the people did nt have a vad at all i guess right and and then they they looked pretty bad and and in fact what they were doing wa nt so bad at all but um
__label__False one eight four one seven seven zero zero seven zero two seven
__label__False right right so so i i mean for for each particular action that you may want to characterize you would have some number of slot that define uh uh uh you know in some way what this action is all about it can be either a b or c um
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm so morgan you re getting a little breath noise you might wan na move the mike down a little bit
__label__False uh with the nnn when i develop this in s taylor taylor series i ca nt um calculate the mean and the variance of the for each of the gaussian of the dictionary for the noisy speech
__label__False alright
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False so what s the turn around period right now from ibm
__label__False you have to write down like while y what you re what ch chocolate you re eating cuz they might make different sound like n nut chocolate with nut chocolate without nut
__label__False so n s so since the high mismatch performance is much worse to begin with it s easier to get a better relative improvement
__label__False but it s on digit so um uh a colleague at sri developed a improved version of mmie training
__label__False seven nine four nine s e e
__label__False hmm
__label__False yep
__label__False ah we need one more over here
__label__False and he also approached me and he offered to help um our project and he wa more thinking about some high level thinking task and i said sure we need help you can come in a a subject and he said ok so that s what s gon na happen tomorrow
__label__False to convert it into the java bayes for format
__label__False hello hello hello hello
__label__False did you prepare some whole thing you wanted u just to see or what wa that
__label__False ok
__label__False so with the new transcriber i m um
__label__False and it s
__label__False you know and um
__label__False yeah so our um
__label__False yep
__label__False it s fifty
__label__True i ll send mail to speech local
__label__False uh we ran out there were some blank in there so not everybody will be reading digit but um
__label__False hmm uh i i think the one you you gave here a couple of week ago would be of interest there too
__label__False and i would be able to see uh not just like phoneme event but um interphoneme event
__label__False yeah
__label__False what if they have account here and they use rcs at that point where you can l really lock a file
__label__False but anyway so you know i mean this wa this wa a a very good talk on those kind of issue and so on so uh
__label__False oh ok
__label__False on the near field on the ne
__label__False no it doe nt right it ha
__label__False it would do badly and it did nt so badly right so they did something
__label__False ok thanks
__label__False um it s it s gon na b it s for reason because of the microphone run we want that chunk there there s more equipment in there
__label__False yay
__label__False the th the m the meeting i r stuff is actually
__label__False there s only one s in interesting on page five
__label__False i have eh error in the in the mark
__label__False except that uh actually for the silence model it s six mixture per state
__label__False at the beginning
__label__False yeah from zero to clean
__label__False so we get
__label__False it wa the morning one
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah me either
__label__False if uh you know there s court transcript there s there s transcript of radio show i mean people say people s name all the time
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False it might be interesting to do that cuz my my cuz my sense um
__label__False it s it s a
__label__False right uh but i m not so much worried about the adaptation actually than than the um um the uh
__label__False if so if that doe nt add time for them that d be great you know like
__label__False ok
__label__False five three seven one one one zero four nine one
__label__False i bet i know who that wa yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False and so um
__label__False right
__label__False yeah it doe
__label__False and i imagine that transcript of speech i mean text that is speech probably ha more of those than sort of prepared writing i i do nt know whether it would or not but it seems like it would
__label__False all at the same time i do nt know if i would get distracted and confused probably
__label__False ok and then the other thing is while we re doing this uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False track seven huh
__label__False yep
__label__False is he gon na come here
__label__False yeah
__label__False do you benefit from having a better model for the noise that would be another question
__label__False so that s something that you re you have nt trained yet but are preparing to train and
__label__False and go upwards until you get the ditransitive construction
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well that would be good to get definitely
__label__False s so actually i wa wondering how long doe it take to train that broadcast news net
__label__False so uh you re gon na be gone for the next three week or something
__label__False so how about
__label__False and then also ca the pruning of course wa too too severe
__label__False right
__label__False it wa actually ok
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False mmm
__label__False susanne bur burger who is at se cmu he wa who wa formally at in munich and w and is now at with cmu she said she ha something which she us to do eight channel uh trans transliteration eight channel simultaneously but it s running under window
__label__True yeah this tuesday yeah
__label__False actually actually kind of careful cuz i have a strong allergy to nut so i have to sort of figure out one without th
__label__False a long a y you re not wearing your h your h headphone
__label__False everybody
__label__False um u
__label__False yeah and so rone over rzero is what you typically use for that
__label__False i i have a well so if you need need help let me know
__label__False um
__label__False so you have to do some scaling but that s not a big deal cuz it s the log of of k time a complex number then you can just that s the same a log of k plus log of the complex number
__label__False um it s yeah medium mismatch is everything with the far microphone but trained on like low noisy condition like low speed and or stopped car and tested on highspeed condition i think like on a highway and
__label__False uh no this is
__label__False yeah
__label__False sure because we we re gon na have to put it in a pda
__label__False right
__label__False the other thing that strike me just looking at these number is just taking the best case i mean some of these of course even with all of our our wonderful processing still are horrible kind of number
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False sure
__label__False i do nt think so i think we d have to do all
__label__False and it wo nt affect the the g the global official one at all
__label__False do we wan na have
__label__False the a apparently i mean we re gon na do a revised form of course um but once a person ha signed it once then that s valid for a certain number of meeting she wanted me to actually estimate how many meeting and put that on the consent form
__label__False um so and then there s a background speech model
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False i think he
__label__False umh
__label__False hmm
__label__False yep
__label__False so basically that will store the the object that is w the source will store the object that we re going from the goal will store the the f we ll fill those in fill those role in right
__label__False oh no no it s tha that that we were saying you know well is how much worse is far than near you know and i mean it depends on which one you re looking at but for the everybody it s little under a factor or two
__label__False yeah ok maybe i ll put this thing here then
__label__False uh ok
__label__False huh
__label__False great that s exactly what is necessary
__label__False so i m just misremembering
__label__False six zero nine two seven three four five
__label__False i it s easy to go back and forth is nt it uhhuh
__label__False but you could split up the sentence in a test set
__label__False i do nt know did you wan na talk about it or
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh
__label__False you know no so they re like um
__label__False uh there re lot of different policy for dealing with it so
__label__False h everytime it wa a gon na gon na die
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False key fi
__label__False you got there you got to out of it yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False really
__label__False ok
__label__False w if it s a hundred then you know that s not the issue but if it s a hundred then the average length of each one is pretty pretty long and so having a little thing at the front of it is no big deal
__label__False where doe this
__label__False so what if you then uh since you know this what if you only use the neural net on the speech portion
__label__False oh ok so he s just he just computes a gaussian over potential oh i see i see and and
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i mean it s um certainly in a short shortterm this just sound easier
__label__False yeah you can search for beep or bleep
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False also it ther there is this other question the legal question that that adam s raised uh about whether we need a concrete signature or email c i suffices or whatever and i do nt know how that work i there s something down there about if you agree to
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False and
__label__False yeah so there is this the mismatched is um the same kind of thing but the driving condition i mean the speed and the kind of road is different for training and testing is that right
__label__False really
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False so
__label__False yeah and d did they use sigmoid or a softmax type thing and did nt they like exponentiate or something and then divide by the sum of them or
__label__False yeah
__label__False nist ha um m a fairly sophisticated scoring program that you can give a um a time uh
__label__False and then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can you know do it a a few day later or whatever you wan na do after you confirm that it s really backedup
__label__False no i do nt think so
__label__False this is the left side of the dummy pda and this would be the right side
__label__False i do nt know if she know about it
__label__False how
__label__False estimate the new mean and the variance of the noisy speech and with th with this new s new mean and variance i estimate again this
__label__False l two zero four seven one three five two seven three eight three five nine two eight nine eight nine two six one six six o nine nine o two nine two four two two two eight four five four three eight four six seven seven two six one one six seven four zero one four nine zero two three nine zero two four four nine one two two six six four zero five nine eight one seven one four
__label__False ok
__label__False uh
__label__False ok we it s straightforward to actually just have a a penalty that doe nt completely disallows it but discourages it
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__True and so it would be much better to get uh dave gelbart to do that than me because he s familiar with the code and is more likely to be able to get it to work quickly
__label__False where is it
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh there is a car noise so there are f just four noise um uh car i think
__label__False i mean even with these result a they are it s it s it s really not that bad
__label__False and lot of detail c and carving engraving and so forth so
__label__True if we look at the france telecom proposal they use some kind of noise addition
__label__False i see
__label__False i d i
__label__False right
__label__False but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and i know that you have until three
__label__False hmm
__label__False i m taking s um six second of speech um
__label__False yeah
__label__False ah era el cuatro yeah
__label__False yeah that s actually well it s useful
__label__False well a i said i think we do nt actually know but i think chuck s hypothesis wa a good one which is you re r you listen to something you write down what you thought you heard but you want to listen to it again so you r rewind
__label__False ok
__label__False and well the result are li a little bit better but more or le similar
__label__False so this cu this could also explain uh the high miss rate maybe
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it is uh must be february fifteenth
__label__False yeah you re right it had to have been more than that i mean it wa a fortyfive minute meeting so
__label__False but we
__label__False yeah
__label__False but you could if you want i do nt know
__label__False transcript l fifty
__label__False so
__label__False it may not be it
__label__False uh
__label__False the the cd is an alternative to tape icsi already ha a perfectly good tape system and it s more reliable
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think that s a good
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok so so we need to split the waveform then or do you already have them split up no you do nt right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i see
__label__False and so we just push on and and uh do what we need to do
__label__False yeah i have one
__label__False i try to make it work on tr speechdatcar and it fails on tidigits or if i try to make it work on that it s just the italian or something it doe nt work on the finnish
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False and i want to edit the function going to that right
__label__False i mean it s not a bad idea to try the alignment
__label__False ok so we re live
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you do nt do nt uh
__label__False um transcript l one one one three six two eight three three two two o seven one six six five four two six eight nine zero zero six three nine three three four seven five four seven nine six zero nine nine zero three seven four three two seven five four two four nine three five one nine seven eight one eight five o four nine four zero seven five three seven five eight four four one seven zero one eight five five three two five o three eight
__label__False yeah so i mean in the i i in the in the decoding you re saying that we re gon na decode from here to here
__label__False hmm
__label__False inside of enter there will be role that can be filled basically so if i want to go from outside to inside then you d have the role that need to filled where you d have a sourcepathgoal set of role so you d the source would be outside and path is to the door or whatever right
__label__False right
__label__False so anyway i think we we have at least one uh user for the digit once they get done which will be dave
__label__False so let me back up again so the when you said there were three hundred speaker overlap that s in twelve minute
__label__False so there s still no no knowledge using different channel at the same time you know what i mean
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so
__label__False sure
__label__False and part of it this robustness seems to come from uh multistream or multiband sort of thing and saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it at least for one one um articulatory feature
__label__False there s only one gaussian
__label__False well you know actually are we having them
__label__False fourteen whatever
__label__False oh ok
__label__False only uh only thing is that the phase is is like a totally nonlinear phase because it s a it s not a symmetric filter anymore
__label__False right right
__label__False ach
__label__False and i m channel uh two i think or channel
__label__False so with this next
__label__False shoot
__label__False yes yeah
__label__False sorry
__label__False aha
__label__True i ll i ll work on it with don and see what i m doing wrong
__label__False yeah
__label__False doe th th doe the h go b before the a or after the a
__label__False yeah
__label__False ah
__label__False oh that s great that s great i m glad to see propagation
__label__False well different digit but same grouping
__label__False oh ok
__label__False right and also i would like to work out some of the software issue a little more completely so um you know we re gon na want to resample and con and bring them over to another machine and uh um organize the how we re gon na store it all
__label__True i actually would have thought you d wan na go the other way and have fewer class
__label__False that s basically just specifying the the input for the w what s
__label__False well if if if you if they last
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so
__label__False oh wait do we have t
__label__False right
__label__False yeah so we do nt store any of our audio format compressed in any way do we
__label__True alright um well the first thing maybe is that the p eurospeech paper is uh accepted
__label__False right
__label__False yeah it s full in there have you seen it recently with all of the new machine that we got uh the sunbladeonehundreds they re like stacked up on bench and thing all over
__label__False ok
__label__False because i mean it should have a similar effect if you
__label__True you know herve s coming tomorrow right
__label__False o o
__label__False that s that s that s the reason
__label__False yeah it s the pitch yeah mmhmm
__label__False which which one is closer to what the proposal wa that wa submitted to aurora are they they both well i mean
__label__False twentyseven
__label__False hmm
__label__False and it is true that the uh that the you know we are using the
__label__False yeah a i said it s just a question of uh do you wan na have to track down root if you have to make any change
__label__False transcript l dash one six nine
__label__False that wa about ten hour and there wa about
__label__False but you know if the script could um you know alert the recording person to that
__label__False hmm
__label__True i can also give you uh a pointer to a paper of mine which is the the ultimate taxonomy of reference frame so i m the only person in the world who actually know how it work
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh this is the gaussian v
__label__False but but i think this thirty millisecond they they did it did not include the the delta calculation and this is included now you know
__label__False well i m saying is i if you go to dave and and and ask him can i use your tape robot he will say
__label__False ok we g we re gon na bleep that out
__label__False but i mean why do we
__label__False but actually we did nt train network on uh both type of data i mean uh phonetically ba phonetically balanced uh data and task data
__label__False so the the middle layer is also binary no
__label__False six two three six four zero zero six nine seven four three
__label__False so what they re talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellationlike technique it s not really echo but uh just um uh taking the input from other mike and using uh uh a uh an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so final dest
__label__False yeah so i think you know basically you can look at some p you have to play around a little bit uh to figure out what the right statistic is but you compare each microphone to some statistic based on the on the overall
__label__False uh what do the uh structure do so the the the
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right so there s just like sort of reverse organization right
__label__False i do nt know if there s a way to define it or maybe you know generalize it some way um there might be other cue that say um in the last few utterance there ha been something that ha strongly associated with say one of the particular mode uh i do nt know if that might be uh and and into that node would be various various thing that that could have specifically come up
__label__False i see
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i just i do nt s
__label__False um you can either do it by target number or by some measure of dissimilarity that you use a a threshold
__label__False yeah we re gon na have to fix that
__label__False gaussians you ve got ta train in each case but for the shorter word you know the total number of frame is actually half a many
__label__False take a conti
__label__False so i wou i would use th
__label__False mmm
__label__False so it s at friday at three there that s
__label__False cheap in term of their quality so
__label__False yeah uh
__label__False well you can but you ll lose a lot of data but i mean that doe nt really help because often the recording person is nt in the room
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False eight four six eight seven five two three nine zero
__label__False then you try to you try to minimize the energy in some sense
__label__False and um
__label__False i mean i i wa thinking about it in term of if i were building the final product and i wa gon na test to see which frontend i d
__label__False i i printed out a confusion matrix um uh for the wellmatched case and it turn out that the longest word are actually the one that do the best
__label__False yeah
__label__False so you you run with three two two five that s a
__label__False this is
__label__False hmm
__label__False and the inference i if you had it written down would be
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False srini
__label__False it s a shame we ca nt do that
__label__False yeah
__label__False i will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplane and train so um
__label__False what
__label__False and we re we have a little problem of no woman
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False one three six o eight four o one o
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False because i think that you did some experiment using the two the two lda filter clean and noi and noise and it doe nt matter too much
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False um just any like like sort of rough representation of the entire beliefnet is probably best
__label__False well we re alright for now because the network s so slow
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean uh
__label__True i guess the other thing which i came unprepared for uh is uh to dis s s see if there s anything anybody want to discus about the saturday meeting
__label__False we probably should at some point here try the tandem the the the system two kind of stuff with this with the spectral subtraction for that reason cuz again it should do a transformation to a domain where it maybe look more gaussian
__label__False alright so i think
__label__False yeah
__label__False i i just do nt i mean i think we we re we re getting rid of major difference like we re not using the lapel anymore an and so forth but the other stuff is just gon na some variability we re gon na have to accept
__label__False so but but if we have a finite what
__label__False mmhmm ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False what
__label__False i see
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False in other word everybody can check out anything
__label__False yeah wait i agree that s yeah use oh uh yeah ok
__label__False i beg your pardon
__label__False o o zero two four two two one
__label__False so i think it it ca nt be bad to say people s name
__label__False and the main thing will be if we can align what they give u with what we sent them
__label__False that s for classification right
__label__False oh
__label__False do a i say do nt do a i do yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that that s true for the hybrid system it s true for a tandem system
__label__False oh
__label__False that would be the sort of probably the safest way to do
__label__False i mean it s still terri
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the meeting recorder mailing li we should add him
__label__True so so one thing is yeah talk about demo
__label__False n
__label__False you find it easier to go through a large i mean how do you read book
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh but
__label__False so my i so if we were to it with a bayesnet we d have to have a node for every question that we knew how to deal with that would take all of the input and weight them appropriately for that question
__label__False right
__label__False i do nt know if i like that
__label__False will be
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False uh
__label__False well our tradition here ha always been to focus on the mismatched cuz it s more interesting
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False um
__label__False that s the one that s painful that hurt it hurt so bad
__label__False oh yeah that
__label__False that s hard to focus on that you know really it s like alright now where am i
__label__False so
__label__False regardless yeah
__label__False yeah we could certainly do that
__label__False time
__label__False seven two five one six three zero four four four
__label__False reference frame uh uh
__label__False add him
__label__False uh p wait a minute it s forty forty for the for the cleaning of the speech forty for the in ann a hundred for the smoothing
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh and and uh they both did very well you know
__label__False msg
__label__False ok
__label__False seven three five eight eight nine four three eight one
__label__False but the
__label__False yeah
__label__False in
__label__False i think it s it s kind of like a a bit of a tricky engineering problem i m trying to figure out what s the optimal way to set this up so um i ll try to make the plot and then put some postscript up on my on my web page
__label__False where one ha crossed to the river there is a tree
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False oh
__label__False so
__label__False i think a an andreas wa leading to this topic the idea that um we have nt yet seen the the type of transcript that we get from ibm and it may just be you know pristine but on the other hand given the lesser interface cuz this is you know we ve got a good interface we ve got great headphone m um
__label__False and your intuition is driving you towards particular kind of uh statistical characterization of um what s missing from the spectral envelope
__label__False i guess i do nt remember either
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False cuz i wa thinking that would be a good one to have
__label__False so it s basically s
__label__False yeah i agree but i thought that the normalization difference wa one of the possibility right
__label__False that s good
__label__False it s saying so it s all above the table i m actually using this other thing
__label__False what what this w
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True it s um in june
__label__False uh
__label__False so a push may be in in in both you know push uh in this or this uh
__label__False this wa like
__label__False then we tried um to do something like proposaltwo but having um e using also msg feature
__label__False well i think that that s that s a good backoff position that s what i wa saying earlier th that you know we are gon na get some recording that are imperfect and hey that s life but i i think that it it doe nt hurt uh the naturalness of the situation to try to have people wear the microphone properly if possible because um the natural situation is really what we have with the microphone on the table i mean i think you know in the target application that we re talking about people are nt gon na be wearing headmounted mike anyway so this is just for u these headmounted mike are just for use with research
__label__False yeah
__label__False or or not constant but but uh varying over time in fact is another way to go
__label__False and uh i do nt know if we ve talked lately about the the plan you re developing that we talked about this morning uh
__label__False ok
__label__False but it s not like we need to be with them twentyfour hour a day s for the seven day that they re here
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh geez
__label__False yeah
__label__False and um and other than that it s w word level but you know the fact that they noticed you know the nnn he said nnn not and what shall i do with that i mean they re very perceptive
__label__False so you would nt necessarily then want to do lda on the nontandem feature because now you re doing something to them that
__label__False it s called a
__label__False well it depends on the situation if the discourse is strongly indicating that
__label__False well that s true
__label__False so yeah so the the di the biggest
__label__False yeah
__label__False i guess if i do nt ever think of it a negative more like it s something we re not building
__label__False yeah because we begin uh in fifteen point the fifteen point
__label__False but the way stephane did it it is exactly the way i have implemented in the phone so
__label__False i wa wondering
__label__False plp uh with online normalization and deltadel so that s this thing you have circled here in the second column um and multienglish refers to what
__label__False yeah
__label__False can i have something to write on the back of
__label__False oh
__label__False so
__label__False eight two two zero one nine two six nine one
__label__False and uh we ll just hafta see what we get back from them
__label__False and what are you using for the noisy y y doing that strictly
__label__True yeah it s or or just yeah it s also all on my my home page at eml it s called an anatomy of a spatial description but i ll send that link
__label__False something like that
__label__False but um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False six four six nine three eight eight one eight five
__label__False but but uh
__label__False so some thought of maybe having
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah that is true
__label__False umh
__label__False because then you would say that in that this phone in this context is a one but the same phone in a slightly different context is a zero
__label__False why why sh
__label__False and maybe there s a hidden layer for that and so forth and so forth then we have context
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh well that s
__label__False i mean if if people really like our our rad i mean w what might happen is that they will get rid of that action thing completely you know and leave it up for u to get the parser input um
__label__False right
__label__False if i never do an estimat a newer estimation of the noise this mean a mean and the variance are fixed
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah ok so early next week we send it to them and then then we check with them to see if they ve got it and we we start you know asking about the timing for it so i think once they get it sorted out about how they re gon na do it which i think they re pretty well along on cuz they were able to read the file and so on right
__label__False ok
__label__False this forty plus twenty plus one hundred
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False correcting we ll we ll expect that they ll have to move some time bin and do some correction
__label__False bayesnet
__label__False is it
__label__False yeah right
__label__False yeah uh yeah that that wa one one one thing uh why i added more mixture for for the speech so i saw that there were loud loudly speaking speaker and quietly speaking speaker and so i did two mixture one for the loud speaker and one for the quiet speaker
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah just you know the idea is with a with a very simple statistical structure could you could you uh at least verify that you ve chosen feature that are sufficient
__label__False we
__label__False yeah but anyway um and that s
__label__False oh yeah that s why i m glad that i m not involved in working it out
__label__False seven seven
__label__False ok uh hhh let s see so we ve got forty minute left and it seems like there s a lot of material an any suggestion about where we where we should go next
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but the variance seem quite high so mmm
__label__False by the way i think we can improve these number if we care to compr improve them by um not starting with the switchboard model but by taking the switchboard model and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting
__label__False i would just pull that information out of the struct that get return that would that java bayes would output
__label__False and we have so many
__label__False um and then just seeing if that is enough to to handle the transcript change
__label__False mmhmm cuz i
__label__False oops
__label__False yep
__label__False then you would have to make a decision ok if it s a whereis question which decision node do i query
__label__False yeah
__label__False yes
__label__False th
__label__False yeah
__label__False if it s the case then multiplying it again by i by something mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False wow
__label__False i doe it really need to go in her ear that that bud it doe nt have to go in her ear right
__label__False ok
__label__False ye we and we d have to force you to read lot and lot of digit so it could get real real car noise
__label__False yeah
__label__False because that would adapt your model to the room acoustic and f for the farfield microphone you know to the noise
__label__False we had um decided
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so beep number yeah the it s just getting pretty long you know the utterance are very short
__label__False and when w the way to obtain the pdf for the noisy speech is well we know this statistic and we know the noisy st well we can apply first order of the vector st taylor series of the of the of well the order that we want increase the complexity of the problem and then when we have a expression uh for the mean and variance of the noisy speech we apply a technique of minimum meansquare estimation to obtain the expected value of the clean speech given the this statistic for the noisy speech the statistic for clean speech and the statistic of the noisy speech
__label__False oh you meant pastry then
__label__False cuz like we do nt maybe we do nt we do nt need to save all channel right so on average
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah but we can know soon
__label__False is equal to log of um exponential of x plus exponential of n
__label__False i m a big fan
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh ok
__label__False oh
__label__False you re saying there s a mike that plug in to the iram board or
__label__False yeah
__label__False you can not miss it they re the guy going around they re probably talking to nobody but
__label__False i see oh i see
__label__False and if i reboot without a network i will not be able to start smartkom because i need to have a network
__label__False so i think in this community that s of interest
__label__False the landmarkiness of uh
__label__False jerry need to enter mark but i do nt know if he s gon na do that now or later
__label__False that s it
__label__False uh this this is this and this is this
__label__False and now we need an expert system or beliefnet or something that interprets that that look at all the value and say
__label__False yeah
__label__False alright
__label__False chuck you wan na talk about recognition
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False that s
__label__False ok and then there s um another thing i wan na start looking at um wi is um the choice of the analysis window length so i ve just been using two second just because that s what carlos did before uh i wrote to him asking about he chose the two second
__label__False but yeah
__label__False yeah who know where they are
__label__False the feature i do nt know whatever you
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean it it s worth trying i
__label__False so
__label__False so i mean i m just playing with um the number of gaussians that we use in the the recognizer and
__label__False hmm
__label__False m
__label__False here just very locally yeah but but that just
__label__False um no you probably have to transfer also somewhere else
__label__False uh ok
__label__False so given these um these feature or or these these example um critical example which they call support f support vector then um given a new example if the new example fall um away from the boundary in one direction then it s classified a being a part of this particular class and otherwise it s the other class
__label__False yeah
__label__False three hour
__label__False but the advantage is that these thing are much lower sampling rate and so then it might be alright
__label__False yes
__label__False oh ok
__label__False wow
__label__False uh yeah so one surprising thing that we can notice first is that apparently the speech miss rate is uh higher than the false alarm rate
__label__False nnn
__label__False and so those are the putative place where he try
__label__False right
__label__False and um we started thinking about going through our bakery question so when i say is there a bakery here you know i do ultimately want our module to be able to first of all f tell the rest of the system hey this person actually want to go there and b that person actually want to buy something to eat there nuh and if these are two different schema ie the sourcepathgoal schema of getting there and then the buying snack schema nuh
__label__False and we had lowered that we had used tighter pruning after liz ran some experiment showing that you know it run slower and there s no real difference in
__label__False o zero
__label__False o five six two nine zero nine five three one five eight nine one o four three six five three three eight one one eight five
__label__False yeah
__label__True ok have a great meeting i ll i ll come back up in about an hour and check and see if you re still meeting
__label__False right
__label__True and then maybe ask th uh these guy the we have great great uh p step forward in term of the nonspeechspeech presegmenting of the signal
__label__False the the film the film is gone right um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but i think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterance that the german system can do we ve already written the the syntax tree for three or four
__label__False right i mean you re saying there s a mismatch in noise that wa nt there before but if they were both the same before then if they were both reduic reduced equally then there would not be a mismatch
__label__False yeah something around there
__label__False ha everyone signed a consent form before on previous meeting you do nt have to do it again each time
__label__False so um i suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what s what s what s happening in in other area like what s what s happening with your investigation about echo and so on
__label__False but um that wa just sort of one try right
__label__False yeah
__label__False there s another kind which s go in your ear and it hang down there s a little b bulb that hang ha the mike on it
__label__False yeah you or have a finished construction parser and a working beliefnet and uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False uh completeness in the in the sense that um if we if we pick these x number of acoustic event do they provide sufficient coverage for the phone that we re trying to recognize or or the f the word that we re gon na try to recognize later on
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we were having a conversation and i consider that conversation private and i consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer i wan na be able to bleep out your side
__label__False that s uh
__label__False yeah they re cryptic
__label__False maybe the section that are not right afte you know after lunch when everybody s still munching and
__label__False i think i it doe nt it s the same a in the the smoother for the
__label__False this is what uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False this is a nice smooth one and it really doe a good job
__label__False that wa a quick response
__label__False well we have a time
__label__False well this is this is in the ti the time domain well we have that um
__label__False no you re right it s i it would be too taxing but um they re putting in a lot of
__label__False um to code d so type of overlap
__label__False so um so that s a nice feature of what what we did
__label__False yeah they d all be like pointing to the one node
__label__False or something
__label__False ok
__label__False and so all of these issue now are now starting to come up so now we re now done with demo we re starting to do science right and so these issue about uh reference and spatial reference discourse reference uhuhuhuh all this sort of stuff uh deixis which is part of what you were talking about um so all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now
__label__False and and you are looking into the future into the past
__label__False well if e restricts
__label__False so uh yeah the suggestion wa to have these guy start to
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think it just whoever is interested can do that
__label__False it might have been yeah we had to get some
__label__False yeah
__label__False i wan na go see the van gogh
__label__False could be
__label__False and if it turn out that you ca nt improve on that well
__label__True july what
__label__False this is a schema this is
__label__False log domain
__label__False well it s relative to the um baseline mismatching
__label__False so long a those word are in your vocabulary
__label__False that s all about that then i m going to talk about the data you know these thing about uh actually i have an example probably
__label__False well but a thousand tap in eight minute is a l in twelve minute is a lot
__label__False what what are the seat number i wonder
__label__False so
__label__False i m gon na collect the digit form and write it down
__label__False so
__label__False i could and they are using a system that s um you know h is actually trained on digit um but h h otherwise us the same you know decoder the same uh training method and so forth and i could ask them what they get on tidigits
__label__False yeah so i i that s what i thought they would do or else uh uh maybe there is some indicator to tell it to start and stop i do nt know
__label__False and pca doe nt do that it pac pca loworder pca throw away piece that are uh maybe not not gon na be helpful just because they re small basically
__label__False no
__label__False and you know we have this this idea of the handshake back and forth and say i m here i m here we re now an array
__label__False ok so that s
__label__False oop
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh speed up your your your marking
__label__False there s landmark for um touristic reason and landmark for i do nt know navigational reason or something
__label__False so these this it doe a piecewise linear and so normally if you look at an fnaught track it jump all over the place
__label__True so so if if on friday it turn out that she really like it and and we really like her then nothing should stop u from sitting down next week and getting all the detail completely figured out
__label__False could be i do nt know
__label__False ok
__label__False i i mean what what happen with the eh the uh clu the uh the clu the clustering process
__label__False six nine eight seven zero one eight four eight
__label__False any subwor yeah ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False right
__label__False yeah it it
__label__False again it s the kind of of thing that uh we were thin thinking thinking that it would work but it did nt work
__label__False so phase get added modulo two pi and because you only know the phase of the complex number t t to a value modulo two pi and so i thought at first um that uh what i should do is unwrap the phase because that will undo that
__label__False yeah
__label__False and and again the main track that you re working with is elev eleven hour is that right
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean what s going wrong on the other end what are they doing what uh
__label__False and it look like you ve found a way of uh mapping the location to the without having people have to give their name each time
__label__False nine four one one three four nine five four three
__label__False there s those that uh yeah some of some of the issue we were talking about wa in j just getting a good handle on on uh what good feature are and
__label__False i think some researcher who are gon na be working with this corpus year from now are really gon na be cursing the fact that there s a bunch of stuff in there that s missing from the dialogue
__label__False right
__label__False what
__label__False i think having a beep too is good
__label__False yeah you could steal anything you want i do nt care
__label__False transcr transcript l dash three five zero
__label__False but uh i i you do nt want to per p have your only copy on a medium that fails
__label__False wow
__label__False that s interesting
__label__False yeah so th
__label__False uh static feature
__label__False so basically it s addressing a variable that s enterable or not so like an enterable question mark
__label__False y right
__label__False excellent
__label__False of course you do have the problem that um u i we are not able to increase the number of gaussians uh or anything to uh uh to match anything so we re only improving the training of our feature set but that s still probably something
__label__False which you got from a different feature set
__label__False we
__label__False the we got to the point where we can now speak into the smartkom system and it ll go all the way through and then say something like roman numeral one am smarticus
__label__False hubfive system actually bandlimit the uh at about uh thirtyseven hundred um hertz
__label__False maybe
__label__True yeah something like that um uh you know maybe maybe we ll involve dan elli at some some level a well
__label__False so the so i the so we might we might get some feedback from people that suchandsuch wa you know not not really what i said
__label__False yeah
__label__False i guess that s why herve always talk about using the prior a one of the mixture in in his allways combo
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False right
__label__False it s not for sale
__label__False it s both there s a there s an input stream and an output stream
__label__False right
__label__False three seven seven five two six three
__label__False it is for prototyping and user interface it s just really the language is awful
__label__False so you do nt wa you do nt wan na put ir un reproduceable data on them
__label__True yeah it wa supposed to be november fifteenth ha anybody heard anything different
__label__False also i m somewhat boggled by that hugin software
__label__False zero six zero four four two zero zero one
__label__False ok
__label__False i m sorry i did nt quite get that there s there s four and there s seven and i i m sorry
__label__False right so so that that may or may not be what you what you want to do i mean you could do something much simpler like under the bus or something where
__label__False ok ok i see
__label__False at some point where the vad is saying it s actually speech
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False wait a minute i think i m confused
__label__False and and do what we can later to clean that up if we need to
__label__False ah
__label__False to the average um speech energy which is estimated on the world database
__label__False uh no actually i wa going a different that s a good question too but i wa gon na ask about the the um change to the data in comparing plp and mel cepstrum for the sri system
__label__False if you were having problem with the word we should figure out why
__label__False i told her that would be a little bit difficult to say so i think from a s practical standpoint maybe we could have them do it once every ten meeting or something it wo nt be that many people who do it that often but um just you know so long a they do nt forget that they ve done it i guess
__label__False and yeah
__label__False alright
__label__False yeah that d be good and then then we can sing them next time
__label__False ok you should be in play
__label__False nuh
__label__False do we have anything else to say about this
__label__False ok this is transcript l dash one one zero nine zero two five seven three two six six one six six six seven four two zero eight five one six nine four seven seven nine five zero five six zero two two five seven seven six zero eight nine zero seven two six four five two one nine two eight nine five five eight eight three two five zero two nine three four four six one two zero eight eight five
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False silence will be better but more or le the same
__label__False transcript l dash two zero two five six eight four zero nine nine nine two six five eight five seven six seven one zero five two seven seven four three one five seven one two zero seven three six eight two six five five two eight five one one seven nine eight three three three three four seven nine six five nine zero six six six three two nine nine three eight three nine zero one three three six zero nine one four
__label__False i do nt know probably de probably depends on what the prepared writing wa but
__label__False um oh i well wait a minute you have this here for the italian that s right ok so
__label__False the reason that we d that we have the problem we have is because it s different in training and test even if the general kind is the same the exact instance are different and and so when you whiten it then it s like you the the only noise to to first order the only th noise that you have is white noise and you ve added the same thing to training and test so it s uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False so you really need to put more more in the in in the frontend
__label__False yeah
__label__False um so that we could use uh you know there would nt be so much hand labeling needed to uh to generate training data for for the speech detector
__label__False eh at first eh eh two talker are uh eh speaking and eh eh a third person eh join to to that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False it s a tradeoff right any anyway go ahead
__label__False exactly
__label__False uh another which is based on manner which is is also something like nine class
__label__False yeah i wi i i will do that next week
__label__False yeah
__label__False and that s just a data reduction step so that you re not trying at every time interval
__label__False yeah
__label__False so running running out of something is different from being out of somewhere
__label__False no
__label__False uh
__label__False but still when you do this and you take the log after that it it reduce the the variance but mmm
__label__True so the most famous building in heidelberg is actually a hotel
__label__False hmm anyway
__label__False um another one that we had on
__label__False ok and then on here
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh it
__label__False one one four two zero eight six seven nine eight
__label__False so we have um for example the uh gothere decision node which ha two element goingthere and it posterior probability and notgoingthere and it posterior probability
__label__False so the
__label__False right so it s great so this is really great because the thing is because he s looking at the per even for addressee in the conversation i bet you could pick that up in the acoustic just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice
__label__False i think there s a problem with this one
__label__False good ok
__label__False ok
__label__False would that be
__label__False no
__label__False i found a couple of old one
__label__False ok and so forth and so forth
__label__False what what what are we collecting here
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False s yeah
__label__True well uh my suggestion now is is on all of these thing to uh contact brian
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah actually um he should uh
__label__False um and the good thing is that we have it s sort of a beginning of what don can use to link the prosodic feature from each file to each other
__label__False yeah cuz a lot of time it s true there were a lot of time when we ve tried something and it did nt work right away even though we had an intuition that there should be something there
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh
__label__False if they really have something they wan na talk about a opposed to something i mean what we re trying to stay away from wa artificial construction but i think if it s a real
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__False four eight
__label__False yeah
__label__False no no
__label__False uh out of curiosity is there a reason why we would nt combine these three node into one smaller subnet that would just basically be the question for we have where is x is the question right that would just be infoon or location
__label__False they had something very specific in mind when they designed it
__label__False so th i do nt think that s a good solution
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False is the reason that we can make a node f or ok so lem me see if i m confused are we going to make a node for every question doe that make sense or not
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False alright let s do image processing
__label__False so so so i m sorry so so
__label__False is there an ampersand in do
__label__False temporarily
__label__False about me
__label__False i i i understand i think that s the bad idea
__label__False yeah it would have to replace abbott basically
__label__False i got two week to brush up on d um presentation stuff and um
__label__False yeah
__label__False well
__label__False oh wait it might be
__label__False it s like yawning
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right cuz we re not doing it for training
__label__False that s a good idea that s actually probably the right thing to do
__label__False the only correlation between the speechdatcar and this performance is the c stationarity of the noise that is there in these condition and the speechdatcar
__label__False yeah well maybe two of them but i mean we would nt use we d only use the distant mike right
__label__False right
__label__False promote them yeah
__label__False so do you have to pad that out
__label__False yeah
__label__False or we could mix we could mix the the headset mike you know just to make a single high q high quality and we could do and we could do all kind of weird thing like having you know squelch so that you only you know you only you cut it out when there s no energy so you do nt noise
__label__False yeah
__label__False we we may be technical but we re not particularly pda people
__label__False they re they re intended to be omnidirectional
__label__False seven six two seven nine three six one zero
__label__False right right
__label__False ok so it s not just losing some frequency range
__label__False i think the first pas is throw out word which are overlapped
__label__False yeah yeah that s true that s true
__label__False ah that wa the second thing right right
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False is that right
__label__False it is binary but it doe nt have question mark because it s extracted yeah
__label__False lawyer
__label__False but but uh i i d never heard that before
__label__False before we i i th with straight plp it s trapezoidal also but then we had a slight difference in the in the scale
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh i see
__label__False mmm so there s our result table here for the tandem approach and um actually what we we observed is that if the network is trained on the task data it work pretty well
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False but not not any time part
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so that when we transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing
__label__False uh
__label__False two three seven five four one seven six one two
__label__False we u
__label__False but i think it s easier to drop in the box
__label__False um and a really common error that people were making wa they were just reporting their uh uh classification result on the data that they were training on
__label__False doe it have to do with those sixtyfours or
__label__False well there s le difference right cuz it s
__label__False so yeah
__label__False but that d be a hell of a lot better than what we do with just these and and and again if you rule out the overlap you have some number for that cuz that s yet another
__label__False wow
__label__False um so we thought that
__label__False and so there s no place where these where the cepstral file are stored anywhere that i can go look at and compare to the plp one so whereas with our feature he s actually storing the cepstrum on disk and he read those in but it looked like he had to give it uh even though the cepstrum is already computed he ha to give it uh a frontend parameter file which talk about the kind of uh com computation that his mel cepstrum thing doe so i
__label__False ok th the other thing i had actually wa i i did nt realize this till today but uh this is uh jose s last day
__label__False right
__label__False this is the method that say that we re going obtain this
__label__False i think because they have th log energy yeah and then just generate random number they have some kind of mean and variance and they add this number to to the log energy simply
__label__False yeah
__label__False but maybe it s not so so easy to
__label__False and i i would like to to to say thank you very much eh to all people in the group and at icsi because i i enjoyed very much uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh ok
__label__False we do nt have too many we just have that just have a few linux machin
__label__False it s
__label__False yeah
__label__False but root is pretty tightly controlled here
__label__False ok
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False yeah you could even then to to get an idea about how different it is you could maybe take some subset and you know go through a few sentence mark them by hand and then see how different it is from you know the canonical one just to get an idea a rough idea of h if it really even make a difference
__label__False do you have the true source file or just the class
__label__False uh and we ve been looking at crosslanguage cross task issue
__label__False i just i just disabled it cuz i wanted to find out how well the sound infrastructure would deal with both at once but i think yeah that s uh probably it will be fine
__label__False well i do nt know i kind of had fun when you played me something that wa bleeped out you know i
__label__False each each one is gon na have a different characteristic so
__label__False right
__label__False um so i
__label__False um i i would like to move it into into uh what jose uh ha been doing because he s actually been doing something so
__label__False so what s the difference between two and three
__label__False and then ten millisecond for ten millisecond for lda filter and t and ten another ten millisecond you said for the frame
__label__False yeah because then the then you would have le of that phenomenon
__label__False exactly
__label__True i would s i would still be willing to try it
__label__False five five
__label__False just plug one ear
__label__False on the highly mismatched condition
__label__False yeah
__label__False ye it s also an interesting problem to come up with the reference
__label__False so c sh we could set that up a actually an institute wide thing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False a are the model genderdependent
__label__False i mean you know they they will find boundary a little differently though you know all th all that sort of thing is actually slightly different
__label__True by the way i ll i i wo nt be here next thursday i ll be out of town but
__label__False ok and then we ll sort of shift gear a
__label__False yeah there s a dog one too but that s in java bayes is nt it
__label__False oh ok
__label__False yeah but eh but eh i have to study
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh on the email
__label__False i love van gogh
__label__False and so you you assume it s given because it s um you wan na go forward with your research and assume that you have that information so
__label__True yeah that s a good idea i ll ask her if she can con track some of them down
__label__False yeah
__label__False blow into it it work really well
__label__False what s running in the cinema so maybe there s something better happening there and then you get you re shown what movie play which film and it s gon na be of course all the heidelberg movie and what film they are actually showing and most of them are going to be hollywood movie
__label__False is this a a s a trained system or is it a system where you just pick some threshold
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False strict
__label__False mmhmm i wonder were um all three of these net using the same output this multilanguage uh labeling
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False well but if they want to print it out that s alright i think everyone in the meeting can access the web
__label__False the other thing um
__label__False but the but the uh fortyseven point nine percent which you have now that s already a remarkable improvement in comparison to the first proposal
__label__False yeah so you so you just should look at that fiftyeight perc point o nine percent and so on ok good
__label__False so um you know there were a l
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False and uh we re also gon na be integrating in this corpus stuff that s that s being done at uw uh with entirely different microphone so i i think you know getting away from the lapel having closemounted mike having people adjust them a they re most a a a comfortable a they can
__label__False so if you see the picture and then you have to scr
__label__False uh but the main difference concern the recursion
__label__False where is a nightclub
__label__False but uh if he s gon na enter mark it s gon na take him awhile i guess and he wo nt be here
__label__False o
__label__False yes
__label__False well we got a a video projector in here uh and uh which we keep on during every every session we record which you know i i w we were aware of but but we thought it wa nt a bad thing i mean that s a nice noise source uh and there s also the uh uh air conditioning
__label__False uh
__label__False you do nt need to read the digit if we think that that s torture but the reason these are out there is do put your name on it because it s the only record i have of actually who wa sitting there
__label__False are are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position of of the direction relative relative to the speaker
__label__False so four point four to four point one
__label__False uh silent i i i
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i think this maybe we should just read some more you made more of these right i think we should read some more because because this is very f we we need to to work the the the uh the talker more because we re not gon na have that many meeting and this is a pretty tiny amount of data
__label__False and maybe for the italian for the td te on for finnish these filter are are obtained with their own training set
__label__False ok
__label__False well
__label__False well i i should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that i had with him so um we were trying to think of way that his interest could interact with ours and um uh i thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data uh and um such thing might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh with jane s help look into some of the data that we re already have and see is there anything to this at all
__label__False uh
__label__False you ve never seen my handsoldering
__label__False hmm
__label__False asru so there s there s actually plenty of meeting that are really relevant to to uh computational uh speech processing of one sort or another
__label__False doe nt work
__label__False that ll be an issue
__label__False no
__label__False wh
__label__False i m frightened by amtrak myself
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False and um so with the the sampling rate i wa using one second or two second or four second is at a power of two um number of sample and um i ll i ll jus f for the one in between i guess i ll just zeropad
__label__False yeah i guess the the uh lda filter they were doing do have um
__label__False i thought that one thing with the htk is that is ha the a we re using the configuration we re using is w s is being bound by the term of aurora we have all those parameter just set a they are so even if we had a hundred time a much data we would nt go out to you know ten or t or a hundred time a many gaussians or anything so um it s kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunk of data
__label__False the th now that these other thing are in there is it the case maybe that the addition of proposaltwo over proposalone are le im important
__label__False so
__label__False so this again point to final destination doing business tourist hurry and so forth
__label__False yeah well
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean if you reran the recognition then you just run it oh i see if you wan na use the old
__label__False hubfive
__label__False five one zero six one zero one
__label__False so um
__label__False i mean it only take w to run the the two test set in just in computer time is just a day or so right
__label__False the spectral shape yeah
__label__False but n
__label__False in which case you re supposed to alert the authority and see appropriate action
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False hmm
__label__False no
__label__False but did you use channel did you align channel one also or
__label__False yeah they are mmhmm they re very efficient
__label__False like the gothere depends on all those four thing
__label__False yep
__label__False and then do then alternate in more depth
__label__False and i i i i
__label__False alright and this one ha three output and this one ha f whatever fiftysix or something if you were to sum up the probability for the voiced and for the unvoiced and for the silence here we ve found in the past you ll do better at voicedunvoicedsilence than you do with this one
__label__False well we do nt know they re still arguing about it i mean if it s two if if it s uh if it s twofifty then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty if it s two hundred if we shaved off twenty we could we could uh meet it by moving the delta back
__label__True i n did nt you say something about friday or
__label__False nnn ok ok well i feel better now thank you very much
__label__False ok so that s so that s two gigabyte
__label__False radio four
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah but but y there s there s really not much difference between the onesecond and the twosecond so just take the one the onesecond one
__label__False so where are we on on uh our run
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean it ll be it will be in the midst of a digit string
__label__False but it s just when we add the tandem the final mlp and then u
__label__False yeah uhhuh
__label__False um yeah
__label__True and i wa just wondering whether that s the same a what you describe a landmarkiness
__label__False plp and and the reason plp ha been advantageous in uh slightly noisy situation is because
__label__False um
__label__False that s interesting
__label__False well there re different way of thinking about it i mean that that would be true if w you had a meeting situation with multiple mike
__label__False one one plus n by x
__label__False i am too
__label__False right
__label__False and we just do nt know about the transcription part of that so i mean it
__label__False yeah well maybe
__label__False well unless he wa repairing it or something but yeah
__label__False hmm well if the person doe this and this and this let s say forty percent for this fifty per like you know
__label__False so the seventeenth will definitely be the last day like it or not for me
__label__False what
__label__False yeah
__label__False ha that started or is that
__label__False so i plugged it in somewhere and then i mean it s like i had to remove some part and then plugging it in somewhere and then i in that process i messed it up somewhere
__label__False yeah l
__label__False uh so there s converges but
__label__False right
__label__False this is all pretty gross i mean the th the reason why uh i wa suggesting originally that we look at feature is because i thought well we re doing something we have nt done before we should at least look at the space and understand
__label__False s so e um first place i mean even if ultimately we would nt be given the boundary uh this would be a good initial experiment to separate out the effect of thing i mean how much is the poor you know relatively uh unhelpful result that you re getting in this or this or this is due to some inherent limitation to the method for these task and how much of it is just due to the fact that you re not accurately finding enough region that that are really n noise
__label__False exactly
__label__False uhhuh but there are others that have backchanneling it s just he wa le interested in those
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean we do nt want anything too practical yeah that would be
__label__False um
__label__False and it work quite well but not always
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh so it go to two um
__label__False yep
__label__False he slipped on the wet floor
__label__False um if there s only like three of them then if you align the first point at which thing get messed up is sort of the location of the first problem
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but that s beside the point we re looking at the discrepancy between the sri system and the
__label__False yeah and the different point of the curve are for five uh threshold on the probability uh from point three to point seven
__label__False and it s either because you re in route to something else or you wan na look at the wall
__label__False two two five five nine one seven three
__label__False but if it make it easier for you to pu fold them in the same procedure and have them under the same directory tree knock yourself out you know
__label__False the rest of it is different right so um uh
__label__False so you you you will be you will become expert on this and know more far more than me about the tha this particular standard process once you you go to this meeting
__label__False what s that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False do we have that big new ibm machine the i think in th
__label__False yeah
__label__False so a pointer a way to really say pointer
__label__False and you re yo you re looking at these segment where there s a lot of speech i mean a lot of them have a lot of word
__label__False where is the castle how old is it how much doe it cost
__label__False so that s
__label__False there s a l there s a lot of these case just like now where i c people say uh uh when they re trying to ta and there s about a halfsecond pause to a second in between and then another word and it s much better if we can keep those together i think
__label__False and i don i do nt want you f feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraint
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh ok
__label__False and yeah and the result that we have in term of speech recognition actually it s not it s not worse it s not better neither but it s um kind of surprising that it s not worse because basically you add noise that s fifteen db just fifteen db below the maximum energy and at least
__label__False oh
__label__False there s tea also though so maybe we should maybe we should do a uh simultaneous digit digit read in the interest of of getting the snack
__label__False uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False finetune little bit
__label__False two one two four five nine three two five
__label__False no it s
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False dave thought it wa twenty but
__label__False or are they all like american tv program
__label__False ellipsis
__label__False i mean certainly the software should nt do that so
__label__True and so i talked to andreas and he explained to me how you can calculate the expected duration of an hmm just by looking at the transition matrix and so i wrote a little matlab script that calculates that and so i m gon na sort of print those out for each of the word to see what s happening you know how these model are training up you know the long one versus the short one
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False or estimated ok ok
__label__False what
__label__False this is you know this is a different kind of speech looking at chocolate deciding you know it s another style
__label__False right
__label__False ok um and um so so in tha in that case wh what do they do when they re t um performing the cepstral mean subtraction on the training data
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False it wa like a hundred twenty and they had a hundred twentythree or something like that is that right
__label__False and e and th all the others really do nt
__label__False we could do digit while other people eat so it s background crunching
__label__False um and it did nt hurt on the male either so um
__label__False so it
__label__False no i just thi i do nt know if you have a hundred or something just just sort of move them up i mu up a a half tone or something for for each one and then
__label__False and uh so that is
__label__False i also have the feeling that um the reason ye why it doe nt work is yeah that the model are much are t um not complex enough because i actually i al always had a good experience with spectral subtraction just a straight spectral subtraction algorithm when i wa using neural network big neural network which maybe are more able to model strange distribution and
__label__False i do nt even remember what the task wa it wa broadcast news or something i do nt know
__label__False hmmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False and um and so they ll be a difference in comma but it s wordbyword the same in in huge patch of the data and i have t ten minute stretch where i can where i can show that and and sometimes it turn out that one of these transcriber ha a better ear for technical jargon and the other one ha a better ear for colloquial speech so um the one i i the colloquial speech person picked up gobbledygook and the other one did nt and on this side this one s picking up thing like neural net and the one that s good on the sp o on th the vocabulary on the uh colloquial did nt
__label__False yeah
__label__False um when we compare like a channel zero and channel one utterance um so a clean and uh the same noisy utterance well there is almost no difference between the cepstral coefficient of the two
__label__False anyway i i i should really reserve uh any conclusion until we ve done it on the large training set um and until we ve seen the result with the with the vtl in training
__label__True are we to r just to make sure i know what s going on we re talking about robert s thesis proposal today is that true
__label__False it wa faster than my pc so
__label__False but that s that s just uh a prejudice and i think anybody working on this with some particular task would experiment
__label__False did something happen morgan that he got put on this or wa he already on it or
__label__False this one thing and the other thing that this with these method is to uh obtain to calculate this value
__label__False so for italian on the italian speech
__label__False i mean if you ca nt use all the processor on whatever machine we ll help you with that
__label__False ha h have you ever looked at the uh uh javier s uh speech segmenter
__label__False but we did oh yeah the other thing i wa asking him though is that i think that in the case
__label__False so the difference if if um if the ibm stuff work out the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through thing that were already done by someone else is that most of what it
__label__False i m not quite sure about this whether i should put this in um that you know you have these two sort of different idea that are or two different camp of people envisioning how language understanding work and then talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and a a prelude
__label__False ok
__label__False well line out
__label__False i m not sure
__label__False so maybe we wan na have landmark meaning now enterable landmark versus um something that s simply just a vista point for example
__label__False mmmyeasome
__label__False sorry
__label__False um but
__label__False hmm
__label__False is that the ba band center
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok i guess what i m i m thinking is just in if uh when these are presented in an inte interdisciplinary context it might be nice to add that explanation cuz otherwise it sound like a pejorative statement on an alternative methodology
__label__False if you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that like
__label__False but the r the write once and the readwrites do nt last
__label__False and so um you just for continuity you just approximate them by by the second to highest and second to lowest
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False well i see now we re k back into the same situation a when we were uh talking about a allowing people to edit the transcript before they become public
__label__False compared to these number yeah
__label__False and the other condition is that they have to get a budget out like immediately or the or they ll give the money to someone else so morgan s working on that
__label__False right what about these lunch meeting i mean i do nt know if there s any way without too much more overhead even if we do nt ship it right away to ibm even if we just collect it here for awhile to record you know two or three more meeting a week just to have the data even if they re um not doing the digit but they do wear the headphone
__label__False we have a
__label__False i i i con i consider i consider eh an acoustic event the overlapping zone the period where three speaker or eh are talking together
__label__False how much space is that using up do you have any idea
__label__False yeah you have to have some notion of not just
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh right right
__label__False but i think it s an important data point if you re if yeah
__label__False phoneme yep
__label__False um but
__label__False these number are uh ratio to baseline
__label__False yeah and so anyway we c uh
__label__False yeah it s longer
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False um yeah that s true
__label__False yeah
__label__False definitely have to go to tea so
__label__False yeah
__label__False good
__label__False it wa sort of a it gave u some headache how do we avoid writing down that we have sort of the enter sourcepathgoal that this
__label__False yeah interesting
__label__False i love nice wall ok
__label__False tony robinson s uh lossless compression thing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so a far a i ve gotten is i ve uh been able to go through from beginning to end the um full htk system for the italian data and got the same result that um that uh
__label__False yeah it s it s definitely no problem
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh well i it s uh
__label__False i do nt know w yeah
__label__False yeah i mean personally i m looking even more forward to the day when we re going to have x form which l is a form of notation where it allows you to say that if the spg action up there is enter then the goal type can never be a statue
__label__False well if the initial range of snr is different we the problem wa already there before and
__label__False not everyone get a password unless they ask for it yeah
__label__False doe he
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i i in in other meeting yeah
__label__False ok turn the mike off and let s talk
__label__False i can get it in here so th we have the uh um sk let s let s call it keithjohno
__label__False i i ll try the cle
__label__False three one two six six one nine nine six zero
__label__False so two people are talking and then a third person start talking is there an event right here
__label__False b by the by the way i do nt think the transcription are actually in the long run such a big bottleneck i think the issue is just that we re we re blazing that path right and and um d do you have any idea when when uh the you ll be able to send uh the ten hour to them
__label__False um another thing on the agenda said
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no they re
__label__False oh it s it s the for me it s the first time that i am working with vt uh
__label__False no one know it
__label__False ah it wa dead
__label__False uh i talked uh about it with with hynek i mean there is
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean the talk s only twenty minute
__label__False yeah i used this too
__label__False so
__label__False we were doing it
__label__False oh plant e u someone who can plant difficult thing
__label__False uh guenter i do nt know if you t followed this stuff but this is uh a uh uh longterm longterm window ffts
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False the channel u thing
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False go ahead
__label__False yeah briefly
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False so if you can in your transcript mark mark very audible breath and laughter especially um ok
__label__False eleven hour
__label__False yeah
__label__False sorry transcriber
__label__False thank you jose
__label__False two nine one five one five eight one
__label__False but eh i i will try to recommend eh at eh the spanish government but eh the following scholarship eh eh eh will be here more time because eh i in my opinion is is better eh for u to to spend more time here and to work more time i i in a topic no
__label__False mmm
__label__False and then we could send if if we had that process down of putting the audio onto tape we can send ibm the tape or we can send this transcription place the tape
__label__False do whatever you want yeah
__label__False so they re taking the number inside the log and raising it to sixteen over log base two
__label__False riot fair strike or
__label__False do nt worry we this doe nt concern you anymore robert it s fine
__label__False it s uh that s including digit right
__label__False the other thing uh to keep in mind uh i mean we ve been very concerned to get all this rolling so that we would actually have data but um i think our outside sponsor is actually gon na kick in and ultimately that path will be smoothed out so i do nt know if we have a longterm need to do lot and lot of transcribing i think we had a very quick need to get something out and we d like to be able to do some later because just it s inter it s interesting
__label__False so um
__label__False the quals w the the the quals slide would be fine
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__True i ll send mail to speech local and see if anyone s still using it
__label__False but how much worse since the weighting might change how how much worse is it on the other condition when you say it s a little worse
__label__False uh
__label__True so you really might wan na try the clean i think yeah
__label__False well i do nt want to worry too much about the delay no maybe it s better to wait for the decision from the committee
__label__False no no more question
__label__False right
__label__False i know
__label__False that s a compliment to you
__label__False yeah you c you c you can i mean it s you know you re just basically i
__label__False oh i probably would i mean my knowledge is twenty year out of date but some of it s still the same so
__label__False well maybe we better listen to it again make sure but
__label__False correct
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean are you gon na have w uh uh example with the window open half open full open
__label__False i
__label__False i i mean yeah i mean
__label__False so if we want to use new transcript with a different segmentation then we ca nt use them in the current way we do scoring
__label__False so what transcriber doe is it computes a another thing to display based on the waveform and it display it at
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False right you would go sequential so unless you got pretty unlucky what the person wa saying and the number
__label__True well um maybe once we have this noise compensation i do nt know we have to try that also whether we want to go for czero or log energy
__label__False yeah
__label__False can i
__label__False you know and i also have a bunch of script that will like generate pfiles and run recognition on them also
__label__False that s what i think i think the two that flaked late i think it wa the battery
__label__False but
__label__False yeah
__label__False all the d s are
__label__False yeah single digit number
__label__False no two is probably better than what i wa suggesting because what i wa suggesting in order to make it through a reasonable range for the whole thing you d have to have the the tonal difference between the two kind of small and actually you want them large so
__label__False you know so i think the thing is is that if you look at the wellmatched case versus the po you know the the medium and the and the fo and then the mismatched case um we re seeing really really big difference in performance right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False i guess the only other thing uh for which i
__label__False channel three channel three
__label__False uh um this this and this
__label__False we re trying to make it le of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log to do this
__label__False by the way i wa told i should be calling you pepe but by your friend but
__label__False i m sure they would prefer it sort of one hour
__label__False i i think that wa all it wa you had some very limited result that at that point which showed having in these these other language in fact it might have been just this last category having two language broad that were where where english wa removed
__label__False yeah yeah ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False tidigits also
__label__False well i just figured it ha to be someone who s um familiar enough with the data to cause problem for the wizard so we can uh see if they re you know good
__label__False so there s a bit a redundancy right in in which the thing that go into a particular you have category at the top under action schema and the thing that go under a particular category are um supposed to have a corresponding schema definition for that type so i guess what s the function of having it up there too
__label__False and we really did get feedback from a few people some of whom were you know fairly senior that that um
__label__False right
__label__False well i mean is this something that we could just coopt or is it no ok
__label__False yeah that s his uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False but
__label__False and either you have to do everything or you share responsibility
__label__False ok what did he say
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False and so you when somebody on the street com come up to you and asks you what is smartkom so you can sort of give a sensible answer
__label__False uh
__label__False five seven eight five eight seven six two zero nine
__label__False and then um i just set them loose and they re they all have e a already background in using computer they re um they re trained in linguistics they got
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False i think
__label__False eesh
__label__False yeah the number are a good idea
__label__False and so uh stephane s idea wa uh let s feed uh both this discriminatively trained thing and something that s not
__label__False eight nine nine one three five one eight zero four
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False i i got the wavefile but
__label__False mmm
__label__False so i wonder um
__label__False i t
__label__False right yeah
__label__False but it occurred to me a few month ago that uh party line are always you know sort of dangerous it s good good to sort of test them actually and so we have nt had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do so that s something i d like somebody to do at some point just take these digit take the farfield mike signal and the close uh mike signal and apply really good echo cancellation um there wa a have been some nice talk recently by by lucent on on their b the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me uh you know trying and change it sample by sample but you have some reasonable sized block
__label__False oh
__label__False that s right th we do have that bi nice marker is that n n because we all know we re being recorded whenever anyone say anything like that we then have a conversation about bleeping it out so
__label__False so i mean if if if i would put it put on the head of a project mana manager i i i i would say uh um i mean there is not so much time left now i mean if um what what i would do is i i i would pick the best consolation which you think and c create create all the result for the whole database that you get to the final number a a sunil did it and um and maybe also to to write somehow a document where you describe your approach and what you have done
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh
__label__False other way liz
__label__False so we have this good system with good vad with the short filter and with the long filter and um with the short filter it s not worse so well is it
__label__False well that s right and that would
__label__False what do you mean by differently weighted they do nt feed into anything really anymore
__label__False roughly
__label__False you know
__label__False yeah i either could put nice wall on it own line or open to suggestion off the slide
__label__False it s just that it seems like the the point without the negative evaluation would be
__label__False no
__label__False hey that s the same percent relative so
__label__False it look like a wave label file almost right it s just
__label__False but on the other hand suppose that uh you re the only one uh who is advanced enough in this thinking to actually bring such a pda to to a meeting and and and therefore you bring it in and you probably want it to be a near to people a possible so you might in fact shove it to the middle of the table
__label__False yeah
__label__False cold calling at lunch time uh dinner time i mean
__label__False um
__label__False nuh
__label__False so either ninety minute or sixty minute tape so they had to try to find an appropriate place to break this large file that we gave them
__label__False if we ignore the sixteen the natural log of t one over the natural log of two time the natu
__label__False ok
__label__False at the same time
__label__False yeah
__label__False i wa like where d you get that ok look familiar
__label__False oh
__label__False so yeah
__label__False uh pfff
__label__False right
__label__False wel
__label__False yeah
__label__False well yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah that s right
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh you are cool
__label__False how many overlap were there uh in it
__label__False huh
__label__False right but it would nt be sixteen
__label__False o zero zero one three two o eight four four five five o six seven eight o seven eight nine zero zero five one three three five o o five
__label__False there need to be some knowledge that
__label__False uh some of the meeting you know our soccer ball meeting i guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting
__label__False well so um should we we do nt wan wan na do the recording status first or
__label__False ok so we re ok we re still ok for another couple day then
__label__False they might not hear it in the well maybe they will i do nt know
__label__False yeah
__label__False weld it zzz
__label__False but it s not a conference or anything he s just visiting
__label__False yeah
__label__False well
__label__False hmm
__label__False ah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well forced alignment would be one thing what about just actually doing recognition
__label__False well there wa an issue he wanted to take it down and then he tried
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh i mean the important thing is that we learn how to do this better and you know so
__label__False yeah sure get all these insertion but i m saying if you do the same kind of limited thing a people have done in switchboard evaluation or a a
__label__False so six gigabyte
__label__False s
__label__False um and eh hhh actually when we look at at the vad for some utterance it s almost perfect i mean it just dropped one frame the first frame of speech or so there are some utterance where it s almost one hundred percent
__label__False and for broadcast news that wa fine
__label__False if yo if you sort of hermetically stay within one task and do nt look left and right then you re gon na
__label__False oh ok
__label__False we have a little bit of time on that actually
__label__False i it introduces two hundred millisecond of delay but at the same time the lda down here
__label__False uh
__label__False yep
__label__False thank you uh of a of a building
__label__False so
__label__False when i added the num the neural network it double the number of deletion
__label__False well let s do some more while we got them here
__label__False yes
__label__False so
__label__False i i do nt wan na say that by fiat i m open to every consideration of what are some other kind of detailed analysis that would be most useful and uh uh
__label__False i guess there s the usual update everybody going around and saying uh you know what they re working on the thing that happened the last week
__label__False did you read the paper
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False nine four two two three two six four eight zero five three
__label__False i got adam s voice confused with dan s and vice versa not for long utterance but jus just a couple of place and embedde embedded in overlap the other thing that wa w interesting to me wa that i picked up a lot of um backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal which you know i mean you c not not too surprising
__label__False and then it s going through and just throwing the data away
__label__False yeah
__label__False there s a klt after the neural network a a before
__label__False i did nt think it did
__label__False cuz oth if we re just taking arbitrary language in we could nt have a node for every possible question you know
__label__False about twelve by now twelve or thirteen
__label__False so d i it s fortyfive yeah
__label__False what we think is
__label__False ok
__label__False sure
__label__False that that it you th think that the uh the i it appears to be a good feature right
__label__False you ve provided something that s useful for you to do handle and useful for someone else if they need it
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False if someone feel strongly enough about it then i i i think they should be allowed to do that
__label__False um so i should probably have some kind of default mean for the first f couple of frame ok
__label__False i bet that sound good huh
__label__False mmm
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False i worry about you
__label__False i ll j i ll just let s make sure everything work on the female and the error rate you know there wa a three percent difference
__label__False sound good
__label__True it d if you if you remember some year ago bill byrne did a thing where he wa he wa looking at that and he showed that you could get it so
__label__False two one nine one dash two two one zero
__label__False yeah
__label__False see i m worried about this interface so much fun that people start bleeping stuff out just a just because they can yeah
__label__False i i tried to find an explanation for it so
__label__False right then you can do like an you can estimate the the noise estimate right yeah
__label__False it should be ok
__label__False so
__label__False and
__label__True so it seems like the right thing to do is to on the on the terminal s side take what they did if it if it doe seem to generalize well to german and danish uh take what they did add in a filter and add in some stuff on the server s side and and and that s probably a reasonable standard
__label__False right
__label__False so we save it because it s it it s potentially useful
__label__False one seven six eight six six nine one seven nine two one
__label__False oh
__label__False i think you r i mean this is it doe nt have the
__label__False but you s
__label__False no no i i m agreeing that this is a good um
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh uh i mean in in other word you you may be putting other kind of error in from the resynthesis process
__label__False but it is nt bootstrapping uh it s it s really cheating
__label__False oh
__label__False you can you can again a a i think andreas wa saying if you wan na use the same tool and the same convention there s no problem with that it s just that it s you know different directory it s called something different it s you know
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False do we want to work on the target or like instead of using phoneme using more context dependent
__label__False alright um
__label__False fo
__label__False hopefully
__label__False maybe
__label__False you know just malefemale englishnonenglish one two three four
__label__False and the other thing would be say if you had these ten event you d wan na see well what if you took two event or four event or ten event or t and you know and and hopefully there should be some point at which having more information doe nt tell you really all that much more about what the phone are
__label__False i guess i d sort of figured that that jim would do that at some point right
__label__False is there more to be said i think um
__label__False one eight seven four nine nine eight four five eight nine seven
__label__False so that if someone just read the wrong digit i corrected it and then there wa another one where jose could nt tell whether i could nt tell whether he wa saying zero or six and i asked him and he could nt tell either
__label__False mmm
__label__False and prepare at the s
__label__False well i mean for the the energy
__label__False and i i g i guess i s just started thinking of another question which is for for the very first frame w what what do i do if i m if i take if i use that frame to calculate the mean then i m just gon na get n nothing
__label__False so highly mismatched condition mean that in fact your training is a bad estimate of your test
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah so
__label__False i i i m sorry i i i meant something different by baseline
__label__False you know it s so i but i would i d pick that one it ll be le good for some people than for other but i i d like to see it on the same exact same data set that that we did the other thing on right
__label__False and then we merge all the alignment from the various channel and we sort them by time
__label__False now you do but that s ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False end of story
__label__False that s good so i do nt need to fill that out right now so maybe we should just say it
__label__False wel
__label__False yeah
__label__False and the previous application wa the powerpoint demo which wa the display of like you know
__label__False what s it do
__label__False i mean in general like we wo nt just have those three right we ll have uh like many many node
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True ok and wh when did stephane take off he took off
__label__False w what doe it feel like
__label__False but if th if there is an xml file that or format that it can also read
__label__False st
__label__False well i think he s doing that intentionally are nt you
__label__False yeah i actually do nt know off the top of my head
__label__False so that s not a good a the one up above
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well the only other issue is we d have to worry about reassembling them in the proper order
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that s it s not enough
__label__False i started looking to and now i m
__label__True there s a median filtering and then there s a piecewise linear fit based on some criterion i m not sure
__label__False you re familiar with th with the origo where that s the center origo is the center of the f frame of reference and then you have the reference object and the object to be localized
__label__False fifteen hundred because yeah
__label__False yeah the only like possible interpretation is that they are like come here just to rob the museum or something to that effect
__label__False to help out
__label__False yeah at any rate i do nt know if w
__label__False yes it ll be pretty horrible
__label__False oh it s trained on italian yeah ok
__label__False andreas is leaving in five minute that that you wan na go with
__label__False oh do we now so um not complaining i wa just trying to think you know what kind of project can you do now versus uh six month from now and they re pretty different because um
__label__False well they
__label__False because of the first lobe of of each each of the harmonic
__label__False yep
__label__False x x this is x inside
__label__False guess you could yeah
__label__False but you know we have
__label__False right
__label__False just output
__label__False why do nt you want to fill it out right now just so that
__label__False if you train on tidigits and test on italian digit you do poorly let s say
__label__False right but you ca nt get it directly from the transcription yeah this is like a poor man s ver formatting version but it s you know it s clean it s just not fancy
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False really of course that s that that s definitely a uh that s a uh
__label__False th the the
__label__False well this ha two or more people conversing with each other they re just not face to face
__label__False that syntactic facto factor do do play a role there wh whether you re more likely you know to develop uh choice that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frame
__label__False well i did nt know i did nt mean to be humor copying but ok sorry
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True it had sort of average recognition performance in a bunch of speaker and it wa a meeting recorder meeting
__label__False yeah it wa actually no not i mean it wa just the noisy feature i guess yeah yeah yeah not compensated
__label__False oh
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False one of the first thing i thought of wa the fact that they use the same number of state for all of the model and so i went online and i uh found a pronunciation dictionary for italian digit and just looked at you know the number of phone in each one of the digit
__label__False oh i
__label__False is
__label__False unmark time of day
__label__False transcript two zero five one dash two zero seven zero zero zero two two zero four three two two one three four six nine five six seven eight o eight eight three seven seven
__label__False the mode basically ha three different output
__label__False i d mu we re i d much rather have you know meeting that have all the channel even if we had to skip a meeting or something just for all these other purpose so
__label__False five two three two six five nine eight three six
__label__False ok
__label__False oh so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready and
__label__False hmm
__label__False right
__label__False four four eight six seven one four five six
__label__False so it did nt align
__label__False so s so
__label__False would nt could nt they also be
__label__False fifty
__label__False well the likelihood are
__label__False two one three six five three one five nine
__label__False thank you for the box and
__label__False they are played from the individual
__label__False so actually i m not sure i would be curious to see how separate the intention part and the action part are in the system
__label__False the decision about how strongly to train the different piece is based on uh a a reasonable criterion with hidden variable rather than um just assuming that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength towards uh it being this phone or that phone
__label__False and um we basically also made noise model for the different sort of grouped some of the mouth noise together
__label__False is the uh notion of recording any of chuck s meeting dead in the water or is that still a possibility
__label__False is the mapping from n to to this phonological feature called um coronal is is should it be should nt it be a one or should it should it be you know coronal instead of not coronal a it wa labeled in the paper
__label__False yeah but we re just talking about something simple here yeah to see if
__label__False i m much more concerned about the backedup
__label__False mmm yeah
__label__False um
__label__False is the d the final state of running out of something is being out of it
__label__False we could we do nt we we would nt use all the channel necessarily
__label__False i ran some test last night but um c the result are suspicious um it s um cuz they re the baseline result are worse than um andreas than result andreas got previously and it could have something to do with um
__label__False s do you get some kind of number between zero and one at the output
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False tha that s that look great alright so in the interest of getting to the
__label__False somewhere in there depending on the exact case
__label__False so it s the it s i
__label__False but i mean if you were at a meeting and and you you do nt think at least that you said anything funny and the meeting wa about you know some some funny thing about semantics or something or uh
__label__False what
__label__False yeah meaning it s way out of my budget um
__label__False right
__label__False sure
__label__False so this is transcript three this is morgan with the wireless lapel two four one three five five six eight six eight eight seven eight eight six eight nine zero eight
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False mu my mine wa it too i mean
__label__False yeah another thing is the em the codebook the initial codebook
__label__False no
__label__False well
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah that s right middle of the word or
__label__False no it s overall ok
__label__False she said it wa much faster it really helped a lot to have that
__label__False it s not pejorative at all
__label__False yeah he s it it doe nt take a long time
__label__False hmm
__label__False i mean th
__label__False wait a minute this is what s the dimensionality of the gaussian this is
__label__False right you know you know where r yeah
__label__False it s just that uh if you disobey them then you risk not being able to sell your product or
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the other thing we talked a little bit about wa taylor series expansion
__label__False transcript l one two eight eight four three two three six one o seven six zero four six six nine six five o nine six two eight seven eight one seven seven o two nine seven nine two one zero zero five five one three zero four seven nine six one five two zero seven two six zero six zero six seven four two three five two four zero six six o two eight three eight two two seven one nine nine six
__label__False am i sure about what
__label__False try that corner
__label__False so that if if they are like pretty c close to one which mean it s speech and if it is n if it is close to zero which is
__label__False but um
__label__False um so uh he wa interested in the question of you know relating to his to the research he presented recently um of inference structure and uh the need to build in um
__label__False sixtytwo yeah
__label__False ugh
__label__False it s we are open to suggestion
__label__False so something s really seriously wrong so
__label__False thirty
__label__False they would like to do it fulltime several of these people
__label__False no you have to say you still do nt know who he is with that prosody
__label__False e plus b is equal to log of e plus log to b and we can say here it i
__label__False i i have i used this a mean speech energy
__label__False i it s i
__label__False e yeah but it s it s still
__label__False another thing i wa thinking about wa um is there a
__label__False right and
__label__False so they they charge right
__label__False yeah
__label__False or if something
__label__False i hope to get those uh those experiment done by by the time quals come come around in july
__label__False it depends what you wan na show
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False on on the real data not with artificial reverb
__label__False bin them up into different category and
__label__False um it wa on the speechdatcar
__label__False yeah just sort of huge
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__False one two nine three eight two one two
__label__False yeah the e
__label__False it s the same system the only thing that changed is the n a p eh a e the estimation of the silence probability
__label__False whereas to whether this would actually be in a final standard i do nt know
__label__False voice unvoice and si
__label__False alright
__label__False ok
__label__False also i guess we had we ve had these uh little di discussion i guess you ha have nt had a chance to work with it too much about about uh uh uh m other way of taking care of the phase
__label__False yep
__label__False it
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um and then uh a we mentioned before we also have the the new uh digit set coming up from recording in this room
__label__False go ahead
__label__False oh yes but
__label__False but how do you score
__label__False you know i i have forward pass working but i have nt done training yet
__label__False i i realized to use it i d need to have these short analysis frame get plugged directly into the feature computation somehow and right now i think our feature computation is set to up to um take um audio a input in general
__label__False um i have some news from the generation do you have news from the parser
__label__False yeah i got it with the instruction
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah right it s uh something in right
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False we were nt supposed to collect any data
__label__False tell me something about the history of that
__label__False right that s the found data idea but what i m saying is uh if i talk to people that i know who do these th who produce these thing we could ask them if they could record an extra channel let s say of a distant mike
__label__False pa uh correct that six seven two one o eight six
__label__False ok
__label__False they re both picked up in the clustering i guess
__label__False because th if if we if we eh nnn develop an classifier and the second step doe nt work well eh we have another problem n
__label__False and then then my concern about which you know you might be right it may be it wa just paranoia on my part uh but people just
__label__False are you fey oh hi i think we ve met before like i remember talking to you about aspect or something like that at some point or other so
__label__False so a little bit of futzing there s the issue about a cabinet we might want to change some preamps
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um it s it s just it s just a utility which queue up
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no w w we originally we did that but we saw uh when we used it uh f for our closetalking microphone which yeah for our for our recognizer in munich we saw that w it s it s not it s not so necessary it it work a well f with with without uh a lda or something
__label__False ok why s that
__label__False oh wow
__label__False ok
__label__False maybe we can do that
__label__False we
__label__False so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net which ha two ha it s own middle layer
__label__False tuesday
__label__False no definitely
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False o seven one two zero nine seven two one nine two three zero five five one six five seven seven six nine eight eight four zero nine
__label__False do you use a pc for recording or
__label__False because we said we were gon na do this and i just remembered
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False that that we really would rather it wa nt a patchwork of thing tossed out that it would be better for um our uh field if that is the case but if you really think something is gon na
__label__False oh ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False um mmhmm
__label__False it s an a attempt to refine it basically
__label__False right
__label__False how how many how many beep are there and how many do we were they d were were off
__label__False and then still do it ahead of time but then at least you re covered if if uh if there s a problem
__label__False or you could just you could have it no active connection just scp them
__label__False they p stayed the same they maybe they are a little bit uh lower
__label__False yeah just explain what it wa
__label__False uh
__label__False but um this is something that s more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning and so you do nt necessarily want to train everything up towards the
__label__False well first uh to really have a look at at the speech from these database because well we tried several thing but we did not really look at what what s happening and where is the noise and
__label__False great thanks
__label__False i have nt been asking these people to do it systematically cuz i think it most ha most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter that wa what i wa always planing on so that you know you get a whole long list exactly what you re saying you get a whole list of thing that say curly bracket laugh curly bracket then y you know it s it s you you risk le error if you handle it by a filter than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in sort of a voc space so man
__label__False i mean i think at least with two right
__label__False and while we re at this level uh there s at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project either next week or the first of august depending on the blandishment of microsoft so de
__label__False so um
__label__False but the first step is al already removing the task s specific from from
__label__False so i decided that i i ll do the reverberation removal on the long analysis window and then just resynthesize audio and then send that
__label__False really
__label__False which
__label__False s that would nt work it s not aurora
__label__False no we re just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working along with a couple of the wired that are nt working one of the wired that s not working with a wireless
__label__False yeah in the
__label__False i might have to do that anyway to to do because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about right
__label__False so that s so it s something which i can actually pursue is the noise estimate
__label__False remember that one
__label__False when you say we have that doe sunil have it now too or
__label__False well but if if someone is having a conversation and you only bleep out one side of it that s not sufficient
__label__True kind of inspired by the stuff by larry saul with the uh uh learning articulatory feature in i think in the case of his paper with sonorance based on uh multiband information where you have a a combination of gradient learning an and uh em
__label__False mmm
__label__False uh actually the noise compensation whatever uh we are put in it work very well for the high mismatch condition
__label__False well no if you if you have it s to if you discus some relation to the aurora task like if you use the same
__label__False yeah
__label__False no
__label__False two four one two seven eight nine two
__label__False no i eh eh p
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh ha ha anything happened yet on this business of having some sort of standard uh source or
__label__False well i p at this point yeah
__label__False or they re indivi if it s individual um y c we can probably run a forced alignment where you c include the beep a word and pretty much figure out where the error are
__label__False but at any rate they ll i i think once they get that sorted out they re they re making cassette there then they re handing it to someone who they who s who is doing it and uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok maybe there s not enough for everybody but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right i understand but doing the same kind of limited thing
__label__False wa there anything else on your list
__label__False ok well
__label__False well it s a country
__label__False yeah
__label__False we know that all that s there and it s a g worthwhile thing to study but obviously it take a lot of time to mark all of these thing
__label__False we re not we re not used to work with this kind of data
__label__False what you guy did is really nicely sketching out different task and maybe some of their condition
__label__False ok
__label__False ah right
__label__False hhh
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah i ll
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False o zero one zero three two two four three zero zero one five five six nine two four zero six three seven eight nine zero three
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False u s t
__label__False and so i do nt think they need another signature
__label__False i think uh i mean uh my guess is that mean it s just that if it s if it s near field the mathematics of beam beam steering is different
__label__False yeah right
__label__False no it s certainly not this
__label__False no not just eva eva like if i u take the v and s pronounce it like it wa a german v
__label__False or one time i wa at this
__label__False but it look like it s gon na bounce a lot
__label__False thirteenth
__label__False so wh yeah where this fit into the rest in in my mind i guess is that um we re looking at different way that we can combine uh different kind of of rep frontend representation um in order to get robustness under difficult or even you know typical condition
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False bourlardhermanskymorgan uh frame of mind yeah we like high error rate it s that way there s lot of work to do so it s
__label__False you know there s plenty of tone space
__label__False s
__label__False i mean i guess i m wondering whether you could just have under action schema you could just sort of say whatever you know it s gon na be enter view or approach or whatever number of thing and po partly because you need to know somewhere that those thing fall into some category and it may be multiple category a you say which is um the reason why it get a little messy um but if it ha if it s supposed to be categorized in category x then the corresponding schema x will be among the structure that that follow that s like
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False onward
__label__False chuck wa the one who added out the agenda item i do nt really have anything to say other than that we still have nt done it
__label__False plug it into the sound card
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False so yeah
__label__False and is it something to do with the mismatch that that s created after the cleaning up like the high mismatch
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah over the corner of the ear
__label__False oh i see oh i see so praat may not be
__label__False you know most of the time even i mean even though it s true that the overall number for danish we did nt improve it
__label__False i wa just thinking we store our data on popcorn how many how many institute can you say do that ok
__label__False alright so we ll send out agenda request
__label__False what s the interesting stuff
__label__False right
__label__False before and after clean it sound like you think that s a good feature
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__False you re also not referring to the width of the object or so www
__label__False um
__label__False you know so she certainly can define it
__label__False yu
__label__False so this would
__label__False but they wear out just from sitting on the shelf
__label__False but he can use text basically
__label__False yeah i m i mean
__label__False is it did that answer your question
__label__False hmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False we re sort of in a stage where we re uh don s going through getting some of the next meeting that jane s ha and uh you know creating a second database so we have nt actually run anything yet we need to get a critical mass for that
__label__False not in scotland
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s alright i just have to run for another appointment
__label__False yeah
__label__False is the proximity constraint a hard constraint or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance or
__label__False rob porzel eh porzel and the uh
__label__False yeah uh how long a
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False bandw yeah so you ca nt do better than something
__label__False but d do you have genderdependent model
__label__False i think
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s good
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False no ok
__label__False i i m i m sort of
__label__False eight week time three hour is twentyfour so that s yeah so like thirty thirty hour
__label__False hmm
__label__False i mean i do nt care what directory tree you have it under right i mean that s just a
__label__False eight three seven zero eight zero eight zero
__label__False yeah
__label__False great
__label__False i mean in general it s gon na be for new data that you look at it s gon na be hidden variable because we re not gon na get everybody sitting in these meeting to wear the pellet and
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh ok
__label__False not witchlike
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok i understand
__label__False this includes
__label__False superb
__label__False so you know just uh a matter of a few day i suspect
__label__False i c
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False give u
__label__False oh is that right oh i saw him i saw him on tuesday
__label__False ok
__label__False no well i have nt grabbed that one yet so there s two
__label__False but to try to do something upscale and purist
__label__False and um they found statistically very significant difference in english and german so i i i it might be since there are only a finite number of way of doing it that that german might be more like hebrew in that respect
__label__False and i hope that if we do a forced alignment with the closetalking mike that will be enough to recover at least some of the time the time information of when the overlap occurred
__label__False let s see so this is
__label__False and
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok great uhhuh
__label__False ok
__label__False one track ended there and the other one started at five meter away from that and sort of
__label__False it s the woman are the problem ok
__label__False doe anybody know how to um run matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it s a bunch of command to run and it give you the output is it possible to do that
__label__False right but but
__label__False ok
__label__False i ca nt remember exactly what he wa using now
__label__False which mean decrease in word error rate
__label__False or what s the use of the the voicedunvoiced detector
__label__False two nine eight one two five two two nine nine
__label__False if you just do this by counting then you should be able to find out in a pretty straightforward way whether you have a sufficient uh set of event to to do the kind of level of of uh classification of phone that you d like
__label__False we re somewhere in between ok so we have some sheet for uh some standard doohickies to
__label__False we
__label__False every spg every spg action either is an enter or a view or an approach right ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False um well
__label__True is is liz coming back do you know or
__label__False and that uh
__label__False the crown
__label__False right can i just ask the nice wall part of it is that uh in this particular domain you said be i it could be on two different line but are you saying that in this particular domain it happens the that landmarkiness cor is correlated with their being nice w ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False so what if we buy uh uh what what do they call these um high density
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh you know if you re doing a uh a sixteen digit uh credit card number you ll basically get it wrong almost all the time
__label__False no it s not good that s not good
__label__False well i ve been burning two cd a day which is about all i can do with the time i have so it ll be early next week
__label__False ok
__label__False uh
__label__False alright
__label__False mmm
__label__False so the sourcepathgoal schema in this case
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False five four six zero eight five five zero six five
__label__False m
__label__False i play a little bit with the um finding what wa different between um
__label__False the uh synthesis is just a question of um hopefully it s just a question of exchanging a couple of file once we have them
__label__False the top
__label__False i might not work
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False but after the meeting s done would they want to
__label__False yeah i just
__label__False no i mean this is added noise i mean this is tidigits i m sorry i meant in in the in the uh multilanguage uh uh finnish and
__label__False i have the feeling that maybe it s because just finnish ha a mean energy that s lower than than the other database and due to this the threshold should be the the a the noise addition should be lower and
__label__False right yeah i
__label__False um
__label__False you probably wo nt listen to it
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i b i bet they re more because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlap than than sort of the middle
__label__False i mean suppose you just know that
__label__False i could do that yeah i mean earlier on friday is better but three you know i mean if it were a three or a three thirty time then i would take the three or whatever but yeah sure three is fine
__label__False propagated
__label__False yeah
__label__False so there it s not just a right and wrong thing sometimes there tru there are absolutely stretch where there is no no k if you were at the meeting and you could ask the person maybe m you know they could they could ve told you but five minute later they might not have been able to tell you even if they were listening to it
__label__False right
__label__False equivalent
__label__False maybe it did a little bit of learning i do nt remember
__label__False same with you no
__label__False but for the demo maybe it doe nt matter i m not sure whether you wan na do the demo live anyway or just screen shot of what we have
__label__False cuz we extract the time from the nearfield mike but you use the acoustic from the farfield mike
__label__False so i guess um is there like a latest version of the beliefnet of the proposed beliefnet
__label__False and they i i i
__label__False yeah
__label__False so a more general thing than discussed admission fee um could be i i m just wondering whether the context the background context of the discourse might be
__label__False uh
__label__False it s uh twenty cd so that s twelve gigabyte
__label__False do you wan na be a subject
__label__False yeah
__label__True david had the suggestion about you know new server and thing like that and so i m gon na see if we can talk to morgan about getting some money for a new disk server
__label__False alright
__label__False yeah
__label__False and in your case it s all all noisy yeah but
__label__False and the time of day is night
__label__False but yeah we re we re not quite there yet so we have to figure out the neural net i guess
__label__False so since i m interested in the distant mike stuff i wan na make sure that there is at least that somewhere and uh but if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to the i might be able to talk them into it
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok so you ll send it or something so
__label__False ok so that s that s a little different than dave thought i think but but um still it s possible that we re getting in some more noise
__label__False mmm
__label__False if
__label__False ok
__label__False well n i mean this wa just a ph phoney thing just to to fit into the the software that wa testing the error channel error and so on
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm maybe you can do d also this
__label__False ok
__label__False um yeah but i do nt trust the current vad so
__label__False we have we have an hour uh that that is transcribed we have we have twelve hour that s recorded but not transcribed and at the rate we re going uh by the end of the semester we ll have i do nt know forty or fifty or something if we if this really uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok but i think that given the pressure of time we probably want to draw because of that especially we wan na draw some conclusion from this do some reduction in what we re looking at and make some strong decision for what we re gon na do testing on before next week
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False like all the different sort of general schema that they might be following
__label__False and um so there s lot of different kind of acoustic condition
__label__False about what
__label__False um
__label__False i mean
__label__True the um so you and then you re also gon na be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we re calling a cheating experiment uh of sort between the distant
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False run like this uh
__label__False ok wha what plan is this a consistent with and then get s some more information and then you see
__label__False if i well you i i in a to a broader audience you could call it a diagnostic experiment rather than a cheating experiment
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False but
__label__False s
__label__False so i do nt know where the bottleneck wa wa the bottleneck in breaking this large file up into the appropriate size chunk or wa it actually putting it onto the tape
__label__False three three seven zero seven four seven one zero
__label__False but for the new alignment what you generated you just copied the channel zero to channel one right
__label__False everyone s battery ok
__label__False st
__label__False so whenever the right now the s the scoring is based on segment
__label__False ye well i do nt see a real difference between rcs and any other system
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False sorry to interrupt um
__label__False i see
__label__False y like sixty
__label__False yeah mmhmm
__label__False i i th well we there wa this
__label__False uh a link between the action schema a field in the s in the schema for the image schema that would link u to which action schema we were supposed to use so we could
__label__False i mean if you have one threshold that work well because the range of your likelihood is in this area
__label__False so that s why i wa curious
__label__False yeah that s true
__label__False and even tilman and ralf sort of said yeah there never wa a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcut that they built in for the uh october version so we re actually maybe ahead of the system gruppe by now the system the integration group
__label__False because we re gon na want to know that anyway
__label__False the monday the week after next is july second which is the first day i get back so
__label__True well actually so this is a test that you should do then
__label__False you just di you just
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False and you can ask all the question about how this all fit together
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False you know give them a little cue about where they are
__label__False hello
__label__False oh that too
__label__False hmm
__label__False would that be more like
__label__False oh
__label__False but i th
__label__False um
__label__False anyway
__label__False and the idea is that this get replaced by a cabinet with door so that so that it s not open to fiddling
__label__False yeah
__label__False well no you want to train on on the nonspeech also because that s part of what you re learning in it to to to generate that it s it ha to distinguish between
__label__False it s my
__label__False right
__label__False um
__label__False i think that um there are a subset of people who will want printout that we can certainly provide
__label__False right i already tried to get it close
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and
__label__False transcript l two o six seven two seven one eight six two two eight one two one eight four four two six three five five six six one one five five nine nine two seven one eight nine two six five nine eight three six one four eight seven six seven o one nine seven three o four five seven nine two four eight six nine four six four eight four nine two five eight six five six eight zero
__label__False future activity something
__label__False ok but anyway we re not gon na do that between now and next week
__label__False and so when i did that for the
__label__False you mean on on the handmarked um
__label__False right
__label__False so it s like s five six cepstrum plus delta at nine nine frame of
__label__False and uh my talk s the first day so
__label__False um
__label__False and so th i mean if if if a week before we have to be done someone say well you have to have fifty millisecond le than you have now it would be pretty frantic around here so
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False there s there s uh continual noise uh from fan and so forth and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh tap and so forth and and something in between with paper rustling
__label__False oh i mean i do nt know did we s did we spend our the budget already that we had
__label__False ok
__label__False um
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False ok
__label__False yep
__label__False oh i did nt recall that
__label__False you mean like yeah word start insight
__label__False yeah i mean it depends on whether you believe that the noise compensation is equally reducing the noise on the test set and the training set uh
__label__False so you can see exactly where the overlap are
__label__False for instance if the discourse doe well for instance the discourse admission fee node seems like it should point directly to the or increase the probability of enter directly versus going there via tourist
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False the people
__label__False but there wa also problem perhaps a problem of communication so yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False actually no wait it is ok closed sort of is
__label__False but i i think in
__label__False so we have nt w we have been always using uh fifteen coefficient not thirteen yeah
__label__False yeah it s uh funny looking at some of the transcript i wa filtering by person and in one of the one of the early meeting one pers particular person almost the only thing they said the entire meeting wa yeah uhhuh it wa just a whole list of them
__label__False well so why not
__label__False great yeah
__label__False i i m sorry then then i m confused i thought you re saying it doe nt depend on the utterance but i thought you were adding an amount that wa twentyfive db down from the signal energy
__label__False yeah
__label__False um like on the wellmatch and medium mismatch the gain is around five percent relative but it go down a lot more like fifteen percent on the hm case
__label__False ok so it s just like a pain to have to send it
__label__False yeah
__label__False what
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False how do you go about this process of deciding what these connection are i know that there s an issue of how to weight the different thing too and stuff right i mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of
__label__False then put a threshold that s fifteen db below well uh a couple of db below this maximum and
__label__False and then feed it to hmm
__label__False yeah i think i did actually
__label__False nnn yeah
__label__False a dvd burner yeah
__label__False adam ran the sri recognizer
__label__False you said there wa a limit of sixty feature or something
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False no no problem with that and we w we we will play around with all of them but the principal distinction between having the the pure schema and their instantiation on the one hand and adding some whatever more intention oriented specification um on parallel to that that this approach seems to be uh workable to me i do nt know
__label__False and for the information retrieval uh don ha been working on that so
__label__False on on friday
__label__False there is some uh a the energy is normalized across channel yeah
__label__False so i ll make a
__label__False but it wa just i think just having a a nice variation in acoustic condition wa just a good thing
__label__False right
__label__False right i it can be a a reduced um parameterization of of the the model by just keeping certain selected example
__label__False yep
__label__False some error yeah
__label__False i mean one of the thing that s nice about what he had i thought wa that that it it um
__label__False yeah well uh just if you think it s worth looking into i mean it it is getting a little away from reverberation
__label__False yeah the c the model are not complex enough to absorb that additional variability that you re introducing
__label__False o nine zero eight two seven six one nine three three four two o five five three zero five one six three two seven four eight nine one o nine
__label__False yeah it s it s not like it s adding up to four hundred millisecond or something
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep
__label__False alright so
__label__False in
__label__False but the thing is uh i mean w when you it depends whether you re ju were just using this a a a starter task for you know to get thing going for conversational or if we re really interested i in connected digit and i i think the answer is both
__label__False right
__label__False but it s known i mean the normalization you do is over the whole conversation is nt it over the whole meeting
__label__False i think c
__label__False they um they gave they ve given u
__label__False and ami might
__label__False i do nt understand so so there s a mike that plug in
__label__False yeah so yeah so that s the yeah so we ve been thinking about putting it into the neural net also
__label__False um so that s ok just map that to reject and
__label__False pfft i do nt know because
__label__False i and if i i compare with eh jane it s probably
__label__False it s actually set to zero
__label__False yeah th now you get to tell u what s the interesting part but yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s very specific
__label__False so
__label__False uh it s a question of what you bootstrap from you know do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then then do your simple measurement uh from the closetalking mike
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah could you put the the um net up again thanks
__label__False and uh then there s still m um
__label__False oh
__label__True so and uh another thing would be to extend this to uh digit or something where i can look at whole word
__label__False well you have to sa you have to tell people that you re you re doing you re trying the tandem feature
__label__False and and so what s ho i do nt understand how doe it go if it if if the peak value s above some threshold then you add the noise or if it s below s
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False anyway what i wa saying is that i i think i probably would nt want to see that a sort of like the norm that we compared all thing to
__label__False well we can put uh this
__label__False the spagos of heidelberg
__label__False transcript number three seven seven one dash three seven nine o nine one o eight
__label__False oops
__label__False and then you know i think there s not much because you ca nt al you know interfere w you ca nt fine tune the meeting that much i think it s sort of
__label__False um so um so u
__label__False ok
__label__False so early next week
__label__False well it s around five percent because it s s right if everything is five percent
__label__False but for italian we choose spanish which we assume is close to italian
__label__False yeah
__label__False so this is sort of lispy
__label__False i think that s sort of the big deal
__label__False we have the hope that it maybe it s not making too much difference but but yeah
__label__False no
__label__False yeah
__label__False too much speech
__label__False so um uh
__label__False half a gig
__label__False maybe it ll work
__label__False i do nt know if that s really necessary to do that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so it might actually work
__label__False right
__label__False keith is not technically one of u yet haha but um it s too late for him now so
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False this is not the aurora task
__label__False you know this is this is excellent because um it get you thinking along these term is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomenon such a the admission fee and something else and something else that happened in the discourse before
__label__False and they said uh the breathing is really a a terrible problem for them to to not recognize breathing a speech
__label__False a a first experiment i think i
__label__False right
__label__False so one thing that might be helpful which is implicit in the use of admission fee discussion a a cue for entry is thinking about the plan that various people might have
__label__False uh but yeah
__label__False and of course it make a lovely def uh story about why language uh make this distinction of course there are behavioral difference too thing you can reach are really quite different than thing you ca nt
__label__False s wait a minute start with a different what
__label__False ah
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so
__label__False right
__label__False and what i did so far is i just used our old munich system which is an hmmba based system with gaussian mixture for s speech and nonspeech
__label__False three five eight two nine four o one seven
__label__False so
__label__False what s the latency
__label__False yeah
__label__False well so you work with the complex number and then when you get the spectrum the average complex spectrum um actually divide it out um a opposed to taking the log and subtracting
__label__False right
__label__False force you to do the work exactly
__label__False yeah i know it by heart so um there s one point when you re running down the stair right and like there s an interruption
__label__False i already know that if i completely remove this latency so um it um there is a three percent hit on italian
__label__False and the math is too difficult for me to understand but it s but it s there
__label__False the demo demo and ibm i think
__label__False oh i think i have the result
__label__False sure but i think if i m talking like this
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok so between u all we have t to get th the demo they need if it turn out we can also give them lot more than that by you know tapping into other thing we do that s great
__label__False ok um
__label__False but i mean if you re gon na if you re going to multiply the output of the net by this other decision uh would then you do nt care about whether the net make that distinction right
__label__False hmm
__label__False this is it and um
__label__False and then we would just look at the eh struct that we wan na look at in term of if if we re only asking about one of the
__label__False i this more or le anything
__label__False five zero five five three six five eight two one
__label__False admission fee or maybe you know how much to enter or you know something other cue exactly
__label__False right
__label__False i do nt know if i thought there wa a line that went from somewhere maybe it wa sacramento to chicago but there wa like a california to chicago line of some sort
__label__False nope
__label__False it s got s slot for eight uh ibm wa donating five i think we only got two so far processor
__label__False oh right you were talking about that yeah
__label__False right then it doe nt need to be backed up
__label__False ok
__label__False two o five seven two four nine one six
__label__False right
__label__False and so
__label__False alright
__label__False well if i m if i m recipient of such a message and i get a sourcepathgoal where the goal is a bakery and then i get a commercial action which take place in a bakery right and and and they they are obviously via identifier identified to be the same thing here
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh ok
__label__False but
__label__False dan did in in his last work
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh before you came in
__label__False i mean there s one big issue with the equipment still which is um ultimately we re gon na well the idea is to have any number of these wired headset but there s this amplification problem
__label__False s uh i th we can put here the set transformation
__label__False which is why i would think you would say enter and then just say all the thing that are relevant specifically to enter and then the thing that are abstract will be in the abstract thing a well and that s why the binding become useful
__label__False brian if there are any particular requirement for putting thing on tape is there a particular type of tape that they want to use or anything else like that
__label__False for the most frequent case they just say it s ok and then they re done
__label__False but when you add in more training data but keep the neural net the same size it um performs worse on the tidigits
__label__False and form u start at the level of noun or actually maybe even sound yeah
__label__False it will tell you
__label__False right
__label__False no what bakery ca nt be something you re gon na eat
__label__False uh
__label__False three two five two seven seven nine four nine six
__label__False only yeah
__label__False begin to work in this
__label__False yeah
__label__False well i i can help them get done um one question is budget do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on thing like cabinet or a hard drive or thing like that
__label__False ok
__label__False i i i i w
__label__False he asked for more work
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False baumwelch training or is it viterbi training or
__label__False ok
__label__False just accumulate it till you get twenty minute worth
__label__False ye i see what you mean by that but i i do nt if i would i would need to have t have that
__label__False ok
__label__False well they re bad
__label__False e th everybody s ear are too big for these thing
__label__False is that right do you know which one it is
__label__False uh yeah i do nt i do nt think the tidigits data that i have um i is would be appropriate for that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False well but remember we re using a telephone bandwidth frontend here uh on this uh on this sri system so um i wa i thought that maybe that s actually a good thing because it it get rid of some of the uh the noise um you know in the the below and above the um the you know speech bandwidth and um
__label__False so where did he get his uh his tar his uh highlevel target about what s sonorant and what s not
__label__False s see ya
__label__False this friday
__label__False and uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False definitely
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i have nt read it in a while so i m not gon na be too much help unless i read it again so
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False you know i i i i think that that people are gon na feel uh are gon na feel a little bit constrained
__label__False o eight o one four o seven zero six two six six eight seven one two three five two six three
__label__False well some voiced sound can have also like a noisy part on high frequency and
__label__False but
__label__False so
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False this is all eight kilohertz sampling
__label__False but it doe happen right i mean and any
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean i can certainly provide a printable version if people want it
__label__False so ok it sound like markham should almost decide when he want to do it and tell u a long a
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False fortyeight kilohertz yeah
__label__False we also still have to make a decision about mike issue what we wan na do with that
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False so right so it s not really all of context similarly prosody is not all of prosody but simply for our purpose whether or not they appear tense or relaxed and
__label__False sev
__label__False two six six one three eight nine
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False i have a suggestion do the simplest thing first
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i ll talk about monkey in italy
__label__False or or suppose it wa nt completely terrible but it wa completely equivalent to another one feature that you had except it wa noisier
__label__False the way it work you first train a phoneticallytied mixture model
__label__True when s jerry leaving for italia
__label__False yeah then uh whhh well i ve been working on on t mainly on online normalization this week
__label__False ah how about
__label__False xsl yeah
__label__False right
__label__False so
__label__False one seven five eight two zero zero nine zero two five five
__label__False i wanted to use i would try to weight thing depending on the exact environment that i wa gon na be using the system in if i
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False here let s see if i can
__label__False yeah
__label__False they k uh
__label__False yeah i think actually my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good
__label__False this this tango enter vista is sort of itself an adhoc scenario
__label__False so what is the purpose of this recording
__label__False i know what i like about these meeting is one person will nod and then the next person will nod and then it just go all the way around the room
__label__False in time
__label__False two hundred million dollar
__label__False yeah
__label__False but then it walk the tree to assemble it dat internal data structure and that s slow
__label__False uh it did there is a reference to srini
__label__False because they did that itself
__label__False yeah i i i will have to look at it yeah that s true
__label__False uh but now you re looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine
__label__False no this is the useful you know don do nt worry
__label__False yeah
__label__False exactly
__label__False fif fiftysix percent accurate for v voiceunvoice
__label__False right
__label__False but that s the only thing i noticed in there
__label__False um
__label__False the extension of of your hand right
__label__True and and th the third thing um uh is um barry explained lda filtering to me yesterday
__label__False i i mean i uh it actually i it actually made the whole thing worse i wa looking at the spectrogram that i got and it s like w it s it s very horrible like when i
__label__False um anything else you want to say bhaskara
__label__False jim is busy at the moment that s the problem i wa kind of hoping that jim wa going to build this box
__label__False um but u uh yes no it is interesting and the other thing is i mean there s two side to these really small uh gradation in performance um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False well i mean there s this cyber transcriber service right
__label__False if you all share that opinion then that made my day much happier
__label__False but they have a question of the result um how are trained the the lda filter
__label__False but
__label__False yes
__label__False even the optimistic one is
__label__False you do nt know what they could be
__label__False why why not
__label__False there s gon na be four computational linguist computer it s
__label__False oh i guess it s the same sheet yeah yeah just with the missing column filled in
__label__False but maybe he speaks about spurt a well and i just do nt know yeah go ahead
__label__False and there s thing that we re doing that they re not doing
__label__False ah
__label__False yeah i like it it s great
__label__False yes
__label__False uhhuh uhhuh
__label__False nine three two six six five nine three three four one one
__label__False general
__label__False oh
__label__False two output
__label__True who s talking on wednesday
__label__False no just sort of ok what what what would you like to buy and then um ok there you wan na buy a whatever cuckoo clock ok and the there is a store there so the task then for that person is t finding out how to get there right that s sort of what s left
__label__False hmm mmhmm
__label__False i it make a big difference so we could do a lot more experiment and throw a lot more stuff in there
__label__False tcl
__label__False anyway i m sorry
__label__False so you need the word you need the word to c sort of control the relative location
__label__False well i mean it
__label__False well
__label__False timit canonical ma mapping
__label__False or even a dvd burner
__label__False four nine seven seven one six zero three five zero five o three three two five five two zero nine two seven two four two nine six three five six eight two nine zero six four three one six eight five five four six nine one five six four seven eight one five four eight seven three five five five one six three one two eight three eight eight zero nine zero seven four one six four seven
__label__False yeah
__label__False u so it s sorta like doing thing in parallel you know so if you know if they can be working on that while we re working on the other thing then when we get them in they do nt have to do that one from scratch basically
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False january you know ro roughly uh which is roughly three month from now we should have at least something like you know twentyfive thirty hour
__label__False i guess you know it d be desirable if a week ahead of that we basically had thought we had it which would allow a week for reiterating
__label__False i i m sorry i didnt
__label__False x time uh o
__label__False oh
__label__False this is a meeting for me
__label__False mark randolph
__label__False that s right
__label__False um
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False are we gon na i mean is it gon na be over there or is it gon na be in there
__label__False and then there s a then there s a process where you now determine the spurt
__label__False but uh starting next meeting i think we want to flip into this mode where
__label__False yeah now the only thing that that bother me about all this is that i i i
__label__False yes i have
__label__False uh
__label__False so
__label__False and i g i got the feeling that we are the only one right now who have a running system i do nt know what the guy in kaiserslautern have running because e the version that is the full version that s on the server d doe not work
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh octave doe nt do that yet so i think you octave is kinda like matlab um four point something or
__label__False that would be a really interesting prosodic feature when
__label__False i do nt see that this is e
__label__False yeah
__label__False but i bu
__label__False um the basic requirement is fulfilled
__label__False yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but we can uh we we know that for example the log of
__label__False yeah
__label__False musical chair everybody
__label__False ok but it s ok so if someone s interacting with the system though uh morgan uh morgan said that you would tend to um chain utterance together um r
__label__False yeah
__label__False i do nt know why that is
__label__False ok this i can i can get it in here
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False no sir
__label__False because it s further away from most of the people reading digit
__label__False it s pipeline pipeline issue once the pipeline fill
__label__False well i guess that s the same uh that s similar
__label__False what sort of discourse processing is uh are the
__label__False it s a wrap
__label__False i see yeah
__label__False i f f f i ve d
__label__False and what are some type of that and an enter a view an approach those are all sourcepathgoal action
__label__False um
__label__False so here s the way i wa imagining it and maybe i m wrong but the way i imagined it wa that um the largest set of people is gon na go oh yeah i did nt say anything funny in that meeting just go ahead where s the where s the release
__label__False ok s
__label__False and then something that combine both and we have twenty f twentyfive
__label__False o zero zero six two zero one zero six one four nine five three five o four two o five six eight seven nine eight five eight nine o one o two nine nine zero one zero five nine one six zero zero two six six two zero zero six three nine three one zero four five six o seven seven o nine one four o three nine two
__label__False yeah i i
__label__False right
__label__False ah ok
__label__False mmm
__label__False into twenty minute chunk or something or
__label__False d you want me to grab one
__label__False and it to the extent that that s true then then it s a big win over anything that exists
__label__False um what what uh
__label__False oh uh
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False and it wa nt trained on this task either
__label__False wow interesting
__label__False oh wow
__label__False great i ll let you know
__label__False oh
__label__False well there s the training uh is it the training that take the time or the decoding
__label__False but on the individual channel that would probably work if they have enough word in the transcript
__label__False no because i mean if we
__label__False we probably will not get those to describe because they were trial run
__label__False you might wan na try collecting it the other way around sometime saying that th the computer is nt up yet and then so then you can separate it out whether it s the beginning or end kind of effect but yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False so if you just if you just had to pick two feature to determine voicedunvoiced you d pick something about the spectrum like uh rone over rzero um and rzero or i i you know you d have some other energy measure and like in the old day people did like uh zero crossing count
__label__False and log of
__label__False eight six three eight one seven seven three eight six
__label__False you might get some clustering from the speaker and some of it from the characteristic of the distance and
__label__False yeah cuz it you know it s r r
__label__False yeah
__label__False you re really dedicated if you re no matter how you parse that one
__label__True oh well i m talking about next week i m leaving leaving next wednesday
__label__False octave
__label__False yep
__label__False it it might be useful here too i i do nt know how you know you d have to figure out what knowl what knowledge representation would work for that
__label__False were we just changing the label to retrain net with fewer out output
__label__False but uh
__label__False you ve read digit together with u have nt you i mean at the same time
__label__False in somebody else s turn
__label__False um your name and some but it
__label__False well i mean d for the whereis question
__label__False this is transcript l dash two eight three
__label__False i studied barry s sim code more or le to take the first step the spectral subtraction and we have some the feature for italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result but we have nt result until this moment
__label__False that s interesting
__label__False and so i had this um
__label__False a few more processor how many are you shooting for
__label__False so yeah so the high so the right so the highly mismatched case is in some sense a good model for what we ve been you know typically talking about when we talk about additive noise in
__label__False yeah
__label__False at the same time
__label__False or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarm by hand yeah
__label__False and that should really improve thing um further
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i i i think this year we we actually uh can do it
__label__False so it wa like one to five so it s still this kind of ratio it s just yeah it s a lot more training data
__label__False sorry yeah i m confusing two
__label__False ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False four three zero six six nine two zero seven three
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False right mmhmm
__label__False just the ch the chatting i actually
__label__False yeah
__label__False alright
__label__False if you re running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter place that are usually not al w you re not usually not allowed to uh m
__label__False yeah
__label__False so that wa that wa the idea and then the other thing that we were discussing wa wa um
__label__False da we had allowed dave to listen to these these uh recording um
__label__False yeah he did nt
__label__False ok sorry you did nt tell me to
__label__False it it oc i h it s
__label__False because we re still testing so we have the result for uh just the feature and we are currently testing with putting the neural network in the klt
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True there wa some neat or interesting case like there s one meeting where um jose s giving a presentation and he s talking about um the word mixed signal and someone did nt understand uh that you were saying mixed
__label__False instead of losing the content altogether
__label__False i mean you can always have another standard after that but this process ha gone on for a while on already and and people might just wan na pick something and say ok this is it
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False so are doing business versus tourist they refer to your current task like like current thing you want to do at this moment
__label__False no
__label__False so the uh center would be somewhere around like hundred and hundred and hundred hundred and maybe it s like fi hundred hertz
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False lift the herve approach
__label__False so this right what we
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh first order for speech recognition you say i do nt care about the source right
__label__False yep
__label__False that yeah actually it wa nt the new new it wa the medium new but but we would we should do the the latest version it wa the one from last week
__label__False yes now um did you make any use of that
__label__False i made s similar investigation like stephane did here just uh adding this constant and and looking how dependent is it on the value of the constant and then must choose them somehow to give on average the best result for a certain range of the signaltonoise ratio
__label__False a backchannel or
__label__False and that would require s updating the probability distribution for mode a well
__label__False the forty plus twenty
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False uh well we ll drag him here i know where he is
__label__False what i learned ok so i think that uh our presentation s finished
__label__True what doe the twosecond threshold mean
__label__False yeah good point
__label__False maybe we should have the reading group here and force jane to come
__label__False i suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higherquality recording you would have to in fact uh use model that uh were trained on widerband data and of course we ca nt do that or
__label__False oh nice wall is uh something that we extract from our world knowledge
__label__False yeah well we should also check with mari again because they because they were really intending you know maybe just did nt happen but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level so then that would double what we had
__label__False ok this person is um finding out information about this thing in order to go in a a tourist or finding out how to get to this place in order to do business
__label__False would nt you get your best number in the clean case
__label__False o
__label__False and not knowing what wa asked and what happened and whether the person wa a tourist or a local because all of these factor have presumably already gone into making these posterior probability
__label__False to smooth the the t to to smooth stronger the the envelope
__label__False uh i mean you d have to do the nonlinearity part and deal with that uh i mean go backwards from what the nonlinearity would you know would be but but uh
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False and
__label__False nine nine three five eight three six seven three
__label__False uh well i do nt know if we if this is sort of like everybody ha something to contribute sort of thing i think there s just just a couple a couple people primarily um but um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well it may be just out yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False so it just ca nt so we ca nt have two meeting in a row where the first meeting s during that hour that s all i meant
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i mean even five minute is probably enough
__label__False yay
__label__False i am serious
__label__False ok so this is morgan i m going to read some number now one two three zero eight two five two one zero nine six three seven five eight six zero one one six two nine
__label__False um
__label__False let s say is this voicing or is this not voicing is this sonorants not sonorants and stuff like that so
__label__False oh there is another short sample set o o sample ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean it s gon na be bad but uh it may not be like wo nt decode kind of bad it might might only be that it go from forty percent to eighty or something like that
__label__False right
__label__False assume we have something coming in a person say where is x and we get a certain we have a situation vector and a user vector and everything is fine
__label__False uh same language we are at uh for at english at o point eight
__label__False so you did nt train on timit and test on on italian digit say
__label__False i ve already written some note here so i
__label__False alright well maybe we should just uh i mean you re you re bus other than that you folk are busy doing all the all the thing that you re trying that we talked about before right and this machine are busy and you re busy and
__label__False and then from that you you do the you you go to a stateclustered model and you do four iteration of that so there s a lot of iteration overall between your original boot model and the final model i do nt think that
__label__False and
__label__False ok we can we can we can pas pas my uh we can pas my extra copy around er actually my only copy now that i think about it but i already read half of it so it s ok
__label__False yeah so r right now you get f fal you know false false uh speech region when it s just like um breath or something like that and i d be interested to know the wha if you retrain um do those actually go down or not because of
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False in particular the well uh that s just what i wan na ask
__label__False and i m still not sure i mean i think i probably know how to fix this i can probably build it better so it doe nt have such noise but it s kind of a buy
__label__False i mmm use some some different feature but not not the basic thing is this hmm base
__label__False i actually really like them though
__label__False yeah
__label__False thank you
__label__False i do nt know exactly
__label__False transcript two o seven one dash two o nine o one two zero eight four six four one five three six six zero three seven eight nine two nine
__label__False well
__label__False m
__label__False um obviously you have something about the excitation um and what is it about the excitation and you know and you re not getting the excitation anyway you know so so i i would almost take a uh especially if if these training and so forth are faster i would almost just take a uh a scattershot at a few different way of look of characterizing that difference and uh you could have one of them but and and see you know which of them help
__label__False no just just transcript
__label__False it s sort of not really a question about permission but more of procedure either those all go through jane or through someone or they all do nt but it s sort of
__label__False yeah
__label__False so it had like all these different condition of snrs actually in their training set of neural net
__label__False like in the morning when i leave for work
__label__False that s that s the
__label__False other
__label__False b b including the feature yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but
__label__False thank you
__label__False i mean is there are there any other meeting here that we can record especially meeting that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of deci
__label__False yeah
__label__False and so i have some script that let you very quickly extract the section of each utterance but i have nt been ru i have nt been doing that
__label__False with the overlapping zone overlapping speech speech what eh different duration
__label__False demo
__label__False right
__label__False in addition it wa before the channelized uh possibility wa there and finally i did it using the speaker of my um of you know off the cpu on my on my machine cuz i did nt have a headphone
__label__False s s
__label__False i the other thing we could do is stop doing the regular one
__label__False well pipelined
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False in case you care
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah eventually we could could just
__label__False or i in the clean situation but but somehow a a natural distribution
__label__False eeesssuh
__label__False ca nt you have both
__label__False this is the fra the original frame
__label__False i think
__label__False suppose we get one or two error still per you know per transcript then we z we might wan na try some approach like that
__label__False go ahead
__label__False o one thing i m wondering about is what this mean subtraction method um will do if it s faced with additive noise
__label__False um
__label__False so they basically their their model for a whole digit string is silence digit
__label__False um barry s going to be uh continuing working on multiband thing a well
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh wait here it is h this thingy
__label__False so because you d have hour and hour of training data so do they cut it off and start over
__label__False yep
__label__False well but that s what we wanted
__label__False i do nt think it it s related to syntax though so it may be entirely different
__label__False i s i think stephane uh had seen them so
__label__False so if you can if you can add those in um then uh you can cut the data rate in half
__label__False that s
__label__False sure
__label__True so i should still do that
__label__False right
__label__False well we
__label__False so um
__label__False so either it ll get cancelled out or you ll get like almost the same
__label__False although the other issue is that the mixed closetalking mike i mean i m doing weird normalization and thing like that
__label__False yeah
__label__False could
__label__False if it s below a particular value it it flash yellow so a i eh but it s not perfect
__label__False pdf for the clean test probability of the clean speech is equal to
__label__False um
__label__False uh
__label__True should we call him i mean is he d is he definitely not available today
__label__False that wa misreported the first time out
__label__False yes i understand now
__label__False how are we doing on the resource disk and
__label__False and you have the original feature
__label__False great
__label__False seven one one eight four one seven five five five zero one
__label__False well uh it s it sort of came into my mind that sometimes even two could be on and would be interesting um nevertheless um l let s let s not
__label__False so i do nt think it will be isolated to one or the two but you can definitely figure out where
__label__False um
__label__False i m serious you
__label__False it sound like um uh we may need to have more of uh thing that are similar to a target language or i mean
__label__False i would say
__label__False i see
__label__False video killed the radio star
__label__False like like a spectral subtraction or
__label__False h i it got it got better yeah yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok so adam janin next uh transcript number two on a wireless headset number two two seven o three six seven four five seven one nine zero eight five nine eight zero seven four three seven
__label__False and so then we can say ok we have a whole region in a e
__label__False and then you can come back to your full screen version of your presenta
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False and actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the aurora stuff too
__label__False ok um why do nt we get started on that subject anyways
__label__False i think that s great that because and y also because again it s not something sometimes we ve gotten terrible result by taking some data and artificially you know convolving it with some room response or something we take a very
__label__False no no no but not for your talk im we re worrying about the th the thes it s just for one guy
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False are we gon na do them simultaneously or
__label__False or is that a different tape robot
__label__False o six seven nine two one three nine six four seven one six one six five two one two
__label__False in aurora one there were there were system that ba basically did nt improve thing
__label__False that s r
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah they are
__label__False a new transcript
__label__False yeah ok so wh um i think i have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is um it s a it we just go over carefully how these note to people are worded
__label__False and i can calculate this
__label__False mmm
__label__False uh and you may not have had that in your dot cshrc before if you were always just running the sparc so um uh i can i can tell you exactly what you need to do to get all of that to work
__label__False a a simplification he originally did this only using silence a uh a putative uh speaker change point
__label__False cuz again the idea is there the limitation there again wa that he wa he wa only using it to look at silence a a a a a a a a p putative split point between speaker but if you included uh broadened class then in principle maybe you can cover the overlap case
__label__False yeah so that i mean to even know um when
__label__False i just d so the one thing that i then tried wa to put in the lowpass filter which we have in the
__label__False um but it turned out for for to get accurate alignment it wa really important to open up the pruning significantly
__label__False what i wa thinking wa if you had a like
__label__False yeah
__label__False i would take the um the original um the original system so there s the original system trained on the mel cepstral feature and then com and then uh optimize the b
__label__False and maybe just fiddle around with it a little bit more
__label__False just give me an email
__label__False so we could
__label__False depends what it s frequency characteristic is yeah
__label__False so in the bus and on the bus um that s actually a little tricky in english because to some extent they re synonym
__label__False oh that s true
__label__False uh
__label__False but we can ftp stuff over right so it s connected
__label__False um now you define uh another action it s it s called um uh s spgone action that ha to do with writing a letter let s say i mean not even within this context but a different action um and this uh actiontwo would have various variable possibility of interpreting what you would like to do
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False no that is relative
__label__False it s like
__label__False because th you know once we have the beliefnet done
__label__False transcript l dash three o two
__label__False liz will like it we had a pretty strong disagreement going there yeah
__label__False so um i guess i ll just pas it on to dave
__label__False yeah
__label__False right excellent
__label__False right
__label__False right they re somewhere in between
__label__False yeah no but run into doe
__label__False the list of major in the department
__label__False and and so if you h
__label__False oh yes mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you want to probably choose the pzm channel that is closest to the speaker
__label__False so
__label__False right if if we if we burn it all on cdrom then um in fact we could you know we could throw away the broadcast news stuff and put it on there or something like that
__label__False and that that seem so it s kind of like a combination of the uh what uh dan ha been calling you know a feature uh you know a feature combination versus posterior combination or something it s it s you know you have the posterior combination but then you get the feature from that and use them a a feature combination with these these other thing
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False and um
__label__False so
__label__False but i feel like i could now
__label__False i wa doing pretty short you know tenth of a second sort of number
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__True so why do nt we have that on the agenda and we ll we ll get to it and talk about it
__label__False but uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh yeah so i wa actually that day i wa thinking about d doing something about the wiener filtering and then carlos matter of stuff and then he showed up and then i told him and then he gave me a whole bunch of filter what carlos used for his uh uh thesis and then that wa something which came up and then um
__label__False ooo
__label__False ok
__label__False i see
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah it migh
__label__False a laser pointer would be most appropriate here i think
__label__False how much memory doe he have
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hopefully a time pass we ll get more and more data from heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff
__label__False s
__label__True um and um the other thing uh which i ll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit which is that um uh one of the suggestion that came up in a brief meeting i had the other day when i wa in spain with uh manolo pardo and javier uh ferreiros who wa here before wa um why not start with what they had before but add in the nonsilence boundary
__label__False s so we switch off with this or n
__label__False yeah so essentially a lot of those node can be expanded into little bayesnets of their own
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False w well that s another way that wa nt what i wa saying but yeah that s certainly another thing to do no i wa just trying to say if you b if you bring this into the picture over this what more doe it buy you
__label__False i m sure it s very individual and and one thing that c that we re not doing of course is we re not claiming to uh get be getting a representation of mankind in these recording we have this very very tiny sample of of
__label__False so
__label__False yeah we started with handmarked data or with uh t you know handtranscribed data or
__label__False yeah this is a word error rate ratio
__label__False and
__label__False and if they all do then there is nt a problem right cuz once they give u the data it s ours and if they wan na make change i mean ours to sort of transcribe and annotate
__label__False well it say baseline asp is twentythree mill minus thirteen
__label__False that s what i mean
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False oh do nt sit there sit here
__label__False ok
__label__False well w i
__label__False yep
__label__False and
__label__False yeah probably well
__label__False but i do nt know how much effect it this have but they do that yeah
__label__False i actually made a mistake because it it fell asleep and when linux fall asleep on my machine it s it doe nt wake up ever so i had to reboot
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but in principle would nt it be better to feed it in and let the net do that
__label__False yeah that s an interesting
__label__False yeah so this is like a two d two dimensional tile
__label__False but so the but that s a fixed uh thing there s nothing that let you
__label__False right and that s certainly one thing to do and we re gon na try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um
__label__False you do a total of
__label__False well i it s it s so it sort of is because it s because have the the time of day and the close it just had the er and what time it closed
__label__False what do you mean
__label__False however you know it
__label__False hopefully they ll get u some more part soon and
__label__False yeah it s like you build this room up for so long and then it s just like you stop
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False great
__label__False uh this seems like an obvious mistake or something th they re
__label__False yeah
__label__False and we wanted to avoid doing that so we they are transcribing the digit
__label__False yes because nobod no the module do nt this is this is a schema that defines xml message that are passed from one module to another mainly meaning from the natural language understanding or from the deep language understanding to the action planner
__label__False well what i wondered is whether it s possible to have to maybe use the display at the beginning to be able to to judge how how correctly i mean have someone do some routine whatever and and then see if when they re breathing it s showing i do nt know if the if it s
__label__False actually we could write a program that could generate this
__label__False um
__label__False it s hard to find
__label__False yeah
__label__False s so to summarize the performance of these
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah maybe the start of your speech and the end of it or stuff like that
__label__False or the earthquake and the alarm
__label__False oh you it wa you i wa
__label__False yeah
__label__False one eight three nine seven six three four
__label__False and right now actually there is a thing also uh that happens with the current weight is that a very nonsignificant improvement on the wellmatched case result in huge difference in in the final number
__label__False i think that s true
__label__False sri really
__label__False ok
__label__False so
__label__False and then it s a form html form so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the time that they want excluded
__label__False yeah susi or whatever it wa but we do nt have that so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False are you still using only the ten first frame for noise estimation or
__label__False or something in mandarin yeah
__label__False so this would be the first thing and then of course try to well kind of debug what wa wrong eh when we do aurora test on the msg particularly and on the multiband
__label__False and if you exclude english from this combination what s that
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False you know
__label__False this is the the autocorrelation the rzero energy
__label__False you can throw away stuff below a hundred hertz or so and it s just not going to affect phonetic classification at all
__label__False yeah
__label__False but it seems like if we just wan na get something to work that uh their suggestion of of
__label__False yeah
__label__False right so we could have up to nine
__label__False and then these should then connect somehow to the more planbased deep space
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i wonder if you could do this
__label__False ok
__label__False well we have a s a time time constraint yeah
__label__False yeah it is
__label__False right
__label__False we re talking about we re talking about that demo
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah but uh we have no discourse input
__label__False when uh
__label__False ok
__label__False fantastic
__label__False well what i ve been
__label__False yeah then we just map it to a reject model
__label__False but yeah that s obviously another thing to try since thing are thing are different and i guess if the
__label__False but there are a lot of different thing like that
__label__False i g hope he got it and hopefully he s maybe he s gone i dunno he did nt even reply to my message so
__label__False well n
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False so after i did that then what i wanted to do wa try increasing the number of mixture just to see um see how how that affect performance
__label__False inferred from the other one
__label__False yeah
__label__False i d i think that this is a wish on his part uh it s actually gon na be hard because it seems like a lot of time uh thing come up that are unanticipated and and
__label__False no we this is the output sort of of the natural language understanding right the input into the action planning a it is now
__label__False doo doodoo
__label__False zero eight eight two one six eight six seven one
__label__False uh like this o
__label__False i think they ll have a b easier time keeping track of where they are in the file
__label__False mmm
__label__False ah ok ok
__label__False so fi si fiftythree is what you were getting with the old vad
__label__False oh ok
__label__False you can
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah right but someone ha to write some software to to actually do it someone might
__label__False wel
__label__False i mean you get a better performance with log energy
__label__False oh
__label__False is it already
__label__False well they there wa ok so th
__label__False i do nt know maybe a constant noise addition would would be fine also or
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False we we re we wan na know how to answer the question where is x
__label__False prune those out and just hand over the one where we have a winner
__label__False ok ok ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False six six five four five eight eight eight nine five
__label__False yeah we did nt have a frontend meeting today
__label__False yeah so my my decision wa for the first pas for this demo that
__label__False i will do that
__label__False i do nt know yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False like ten percent better
__label__False you can get a little feeling for it that way yeah that is probably right
__label__False i think w we should do absolutely no work for the two week that he s gone
__label__False yeah th right now it is taking a bit of time to turn around the meeting from ibm part there s there s several problem one is um we were giving them these large file which they then had to split up and put onto cassette tape
__label__False there s a cubic root that happens right
__label__False right
__label__False ok but more emphasis on the computational or emphasis on the linguist
__label__False they did nt include it
__label__False lda filter need a set of a set of training to obtain the filter
__label__False yeah so anyway so so this wa the first actual experimental evidence i d seen that wa consistent with this anecdotal stuff
__label__False yeah both channel
__label__False yeah
__label__False if we use the same language
__label__False i would have meeting with the folk in cambridge when i wa at bbn over the phone they had a um some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me it would come on and we d hear all this noise
__label__False it cost a lot the the amount you put in your credit card and a well but uh but anyway so uh that s um also got ta be worked out hopefully over the next few week so that that it becomes clear uh what piece uh robert want to jump into
__label__False but of course no i i i mean it ha a life of it own it s sort of partially inspired by the spatial
__label__False that s fine
__label__False and so when you do your wh i m what is the task for the class project to come up with the phone or to come up with these vector to see how closely they match the phone or
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m i m showing now an envelope um maybe you ll f for this time
__label__False um what do you mean if the gothere say no then the gothere is
__label__False i mean it take you have to do an overnight basically the way it is set up now
__label__False yeah
__label__False and so
__label__False uh
__label__False ok
__label__False i do nt like that term
__label__False yeah
__label__False well although by the way
__label__False at the input of the neural net you have this uh f nine frame of context plus the delta
__label__False right
__label__False yeah i see
__label__False yeah but are we having them do digit
__label__False yeah
__label__False maybe you could go to these parlor and and you could you know you know have have you know reduced rate if you if you can do the measurement
__label__False sort of how it sound
__label__False so it it it it it is l somehow similar to what
__label__False because these net are trained on wellcontrolled condition i mean the label are obtained on clean speech and we add noise after
__label__False yeah i did nt think so
__label__False it s always exciting to hear that java s faster than something
__label__False yeah and um cuz the uh
__label__False yeah but
__label__False i i dunno if that s an uh artifact of playback bu uh i do nt think it s probably in the original file
__label__False in the end yeah
__label__False yeah in this case well we can put here a y
__label__False nuh
__label__False great i sent email when i finished the that one that wa sort of son
__label__False but were nt you cheating in those experiment
__label__False there s so many possibility uh ok why do nt we go
__label__False uh bigram
__label__False yeah good thinking
__label__False aha
__label__False right
__label__False i just gave one one meeting to to liz who wanted to to try it for for the recognizer a uh apparently the recognizer had problem with those long chunk of speech which took too much memory or whatever and so she she will try that i think and i m i m working on it so i hope
__label__False it just a mail that you know he s sending me the the the stuff soon and i wa completely flabbergasted here and i and that s also it s it s going to produce the concepttospeech uh blahblahblah information for necessary for one point one in english based on the english you know in english so
__label__False uh no i do nt think so
__label__False um and similarly with the parsing uh we re gon na worry about parsing uh the general case you know construction parser for general construction
__label__False so probably it should be something we should try then is to is to see if is at some point just to take i to transform the data and then and then uh use th use it for the sri system
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok then uh another issue on file reorganization is uh making data available to people outside icsi
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False ok i guess uh unless somebody ha something else we ll read read our digit and we ll get our get our last bit of uh jose s jose jose s digit uh i m sorry
__label__False transcript one nine three one dash one nine five zero seven eight
__label__False ok
__label__False so it still ha most of the delay it just doe nt
__label__False it s nonstandard and so you ca nt just plug something in you need to get it wired
__label__False ok depends on who s working on it
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False oh i do nt know if a transcr uh
__label__False hmm hmm um
__label__False there are those are the two option either like make an arrow directly or put a new node
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah well he david s planning to get new server anyways for all of the main server
__label__False what
__label__False um and um it s not clear to me yet whether that s something significant
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False and then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people wo nt and
__label__False and the dialogue are pretty pretty you know concise and anyway
__label__False i ll just go buy their process
__label__False well i mean it look better but i mean the thing is if if uh if you re actually asking you know if you actually j uh need to do place along an fft it may be it may be pushing thing
__label__False huh
__label__False i
__label__False hmm
__label__False what would be nice if it is if it just like kept the old function for either value but
__label__False uh no no no the idea wa i guess to to use them a a feature
__label__False but there s something about bowel problem or something with the dog
__label__False and
__label__False johno ca nt stop tangoing we may actually include you know those those intention
__label__False so we have our first information retrieval example it s a regular expression searcher
__label__False well i do nt know but
__label__False ok and and also da dave gelbart so there s this this problem of and w and so we had this meeting th the also adam before the the before you went away
__label__False nineteenth
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh yeah i think so
__label__False yeah
__label__False so let s say roughly ten hour or so of
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yes
__label__False o one five two three one two five nine one three seven zero zero four five zero one four five three five six seven nine four one nine zero
__label__False so the problem with rcs is that if two people want to modify a file at the same time they ca nt because the granularity of locking is at the file level
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and then you know i mean the thing is if we were getting uh what thirtyfive forty percent something like that on on that particular set uh doe it go to seventy or eighty or doe it use up so much memory we ca nt decode it
__label__False so
__label__False zero three eight zero two seven four six nine six
__label__False three one three o nine six nine four nine
__label__False oh um actually um
__label__False yeah you have like a sanity sanity check on them that s a good idea alternating
__label__False you know have a have a couple markov model and and uh try to indi try to determine you know w when is th when are you in an overlap when are you not in an overlap
__label__False h
__label__False one four two two seven four three one nine nine three three
__label__False yeah so d with the delay that s gone is the input which is the sixty millisecond
__label__False so you re sort of going the other way of what you were saying a bit ago instead of yeah
__label__False um
__label__False and if they wan na make change they can do that
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh you are like r r reducing the floor of the noisy region right
__label__False i m just worried about letting everybody go in and make change cuz it s real easy when you re trying to i do nt know run alignment and there s a word you wan na fix to go in and do that and then mess up other thing if you do nt know you know the overall philosophy behind the the convention
__label__False and it
__label__False and there s a screw that you can tighten
__label__False i see
__label__False no i did nt have any problem i m sorry
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh that would be interesting
__label__False you know
__label__False and the broad english data is what you got this one point one with so that s timit basically right
__label__False so um for uh tidigits for in example uh when we go from tidigits training to timit training uh we lose uh around ten percent uh
__label__False well the the sort of general idea wa you can think about meeting at lot of different level all the way d from all the way down to acoustic to all the way up to dialogue discourse topic
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok um so i guess i ll go ahead
__label__False the c stand for concurrent
__label__False yeah this is kind of inter interesting also because if we use the standard uh frame length of of like twentyfive millisecond um what happens is that for lowpitched voiced because of the frame length y you do nt really have you do nt clearly see this periodic structure
__label__False that put it into the format that the bayes n or java bayes or whatever want
__label__False this is with the clean
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so i have like the fiftyone point o nine and so
__label__False yeah that s what it seems like to me it s pretty good
__label__False yeah
__label__False inserted one
__label__False nine three zero
__label__False and if you if you look
__label__False so it s twotwenty i the is this are these twentymillisecond frame is that why is it after downsampling or
__label__False mmm
__label__False i know that he s going to like taiwan and other place to eat so
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean the ar ar are do they allow business people to be doing nonbusiness thing at the moment
__label__False so this is yeah
__label__False so with construal you do nt have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule
__label__False yeah
__label__False there s lot of clicking i m sure a i m trying to get this to work correctly
__label__False ok
__label__False ok so um anything else you want to ask u about the thesis proposal you got
__label__False and then forty forty p
__label__False and the tape is hi is very reliable
__label__False yeah probably not yeah
__label__False but including the feature
__label__False there s like a little the twisty thing you can move it with
__label__False i mean u um mari wa asking wa trying to come up with something like an agenda and we re sort of fitting around people s time a bit
__label__False i do nt know if we want to talk about that but well the the car noise are below like five hundred hertz and we were looking at the music utterance and in this case the noise is more about two thousand hertz
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False what about if the time overlap with the normal backup time
__label__False did it get rid of other stuff too though
__label__False but i i i
__label__False yeah so with a short frame basically you have only two period and it s not not enough to to have this kind of neat thing but
__label__False right
__label__False are you are your mike o is your mike on ok
__label__False just ignore everything that ha any overlap
__label__False unless you put it in the text and i do nt think it s there yet about we talked about is the um scalability that you get by um combining the construction with the general construal mechanism is that in there
__label__False you have several some unvoiced
__label__False yeah so you given that um
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False channel channel three yeah ok
__label__False i talked to some ibm guy uh last january i think i wa there and so people who were working on the on their viavoice dictation product
__label__False if
__label__False and let s come up with a first cut at what this should look like
__label__False so it seems funny that
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__True um i will start work on multiband
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok transcript number one one nine one dash one two one zero eight zero one one
__label__False but ok but once you start sart start smartkom you can be on you do nt have to be on a network anymore is that the deal
__label__False yeah
__label__False wow very nice
__label__False yeah
__label__False which one
__label__False i m sure the professional transcriber obviously do nt have any use for
__label__False uh and so we have to be concerned with
__label__False yeah
__label__False do they believe you can get speaker location out of it cuz that s that s one way we could sneak it in
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i wa going to
__label__False yeah
__label__False well i can see why
__label__False anyway
__label__False yeah that s a good like error checking approach i think
__label__False vad the result is better and we put everything the result is better but it s not better than the result that we have without vt
__label__False hmm
__label__False eight nine two six six one one nine five seven three six
__label__False uh
__label__False huh
__label__False ok
__label__False so this is this is one it s one hour of of of speech
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False so
__label__False and so you said this is pretty doing this kind of thing is pretty robust to noise
__label__False yeah
__label__False why not yeah
__label__False no actually actually the wellmatched condition is still quite di still quite difficult
__label__False y you definitely wan na w do nt wan na waste that money on research you know
__label__False no i got pretty excited because it completely got rid of the speech so i wa thinking well so you know it could be useful for lot of thing so we have to
__label__False but but but how did we get the how did we determine the link uh that we re testing on in the stuff we reported
__label__False uh but i guess
__label__False oh when p how many construction do people have
__label__False yeah i think this contraption around your head is not working so well
__label__False well take a look
__label__False well they hear the beep again wa that that beep or wa that a different beep so that s why chuck wa suggesting different tone my original thought wa you could have a different tone for each speaker
__label__False yeah
__label__False for this particular digit one i just picked that one
__label__False so doe that mean instead of having ton and ton of rule in your contextfree grammar you just have these base construct and then a general mechanism for coercing them
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh wh why do nt
__label__False and um is there anyone who doe nt know nancy
__label__False so the intention wa to put everything except the audio file themselves under revision control
__label__False so what s the overall effe i mean you have nt done all the experiment but you said it wa i somewhat better say five percent better for the first two condition and fifteen percent worse for the other one
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah go up one
__label__False this is noisy tidigits i assume
__label__False it actually doe nt have a whole lot of m speech stuff to it it s
__label__False two week
__label__False yeah noisy noisy feature
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False um
__label__False it s
__label__False i believe so uh
__label__False uh well it depends on how many thing it s linked to
__label__False yeah
__label__False the median filter is enforcing a i it having some continuity
__label__False mmm forty
__label__False it seemed to me when i wa using dragon that it wa really microphone placement helped an in uh an enormous amount so you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose it doe nt the wind doe nt hit the mike
__label__False uh a you know part of the problem with evaluation right now is that the word model are pretty bad and nobody want ha ha approached improving them
__label__False they they compute the relative improvement first and then average that with a weighting
__label__False ok did i t yeah i left it on
__label__False and now they all have that
__label__False so it s the amount of
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False toll
__label__False and then if they do nt you re done if they do then he provides them access to the the web site
__label__False uh
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah but it s the same frame and
__label__False right but it s not the amount of speaker it s the num it s the amount of data per speaker
__label__False it still ha the median filter so
__label__False slightly bad
__label__False so uh you see don the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project it s just uh
__label__False mmm
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think we can ha
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we can try it but
__label__False prosody
__label__False well first you have to filter the whole training set and retrain
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yep
__label__False right
__label__False six eight five zero seven four eight seven eight eight zero eight
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False right
__label__False if you add a g good v very good vad that work a well a a vad working on clean speech then you wou you would go
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i ll probably i c might have i ll probably have comment for you separately not important anyway
__label__False chuck came up here and recorded some di himself speaking some digit and so it just go beep one beep and then the phrase and then beep two beep and then the phrase
__label__False i could say something but
__label__False you know how you do nt like that one it s ok
__label__False but noisy timit
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False and once we choose that how do we split up the effort
__label__False so
__label__False so this
__label__False oh ok
__label__False mmm yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm gaussianmixturebased hmm thing we use is gon na depend uh
__label__False exactly
__label__False yeah
__label__False do nt we have something downstairs
__label__False oh it s just not working
__label__False yeah i m also agreeing that a simple pru
__label__False oh no is that good or bad
__label__False so and the h
__label__False that s right
__label__False and the stylized fnaught feature are pretty cool
__label__False so it s two hundred actually
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but but there re there re there re some other difference too
__label__False i think fudge is pretty fast too
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah the yeah it s true
__label__False it s too hard usually
__label__False oh yeah in training still
__label__False so i think the who the whole reason for having a long a we have which wa like a week and a half is is because of bug like that
__label__False um
__label__False no i m serious
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i think that we re gon na end up with uh better coverage of the backchannels but at the same time we re benefitting tremendously from the presegmentation because there are huge place where there is just absolutely no activity at all
__label__False is this is this vad a mlp
__label__False but that s a separate training
__label__False i mean it i
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah maybe
__label__False what do you what do you
__label__False mmhmm no actually i think i well what do we do with the ann is is something like that except that it s not linear but it s it s like a nonlinear discriminant analysis but
__label__False well no they they have number though right so i think they re they re doing something like that i think that they re they re
__label__False yeah
__label__False there s a lot of those
__label__False yeah if we if we did mod ten then
__label__False it s your hair
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh of a of a segment that they re hearing
__label__False well a relation other than negation maybe um
__label__False so we can either be in a hurry or not but we can not be in a medium hurry at the moment
__label__False yeah
__label__False no
__label__False but
__label__False you you you um
__label__False yeah so i think for the l stuff liz wa talking about we have something that ll work now
__label__False so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s scenariobased it s it s humancomputer interface it s really pretty different but i i i have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they re gon na do but i do nt think i it it doe nt match anything that we ve described about meeting
__label__False but uh on the other hand i saw that the they had a good point that uh if we had something that worked for many case before maybe starting from there a little bit because ultimately we re gon na end up with some s su kind of structure like that where you have some kind of simple hmm and you re testing the hypothesis that uh there is a change so so anyway i just reporting that but uh uh
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah ok i i gotcha
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah and so when you average the the relative improvement it tends to to give a lot of of um importance to the wellmatched case because the baseline is already very good and um i it s
__label__False well ok so the limit of the over of of the interface are such that we were at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand the the interface or find other tool which already do what would be useful because what would ultimately be um ideal in my my view and i think i mean i had the sense that it wa consensus is that um a thoroughgoing musical score notation would be the best way to go
__label__False oh ok um
__label__False so uh a a result of that we have a reduced um transmission rate for the bit
__label__False good yeah yeah you could do all these inference yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False there there s a drivein thesis uh sh joint over in saarbruecken
__label__False oh i mean
__label__False mmm and it doe nt seem to help
__label__False oh this is a
__label__False so the top of the second of pa page two you have a sentence
__label__False um and they are being assembled a we speak i hope
__label__False right
__label__False and um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so it s um
__label__False very future
__label__False but
__label__False so this wa the human subject folk who said this or that that
__label__False yeah figured that would have been i my guess
__label__False so so i so that s interesting
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i think
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh i yeah but i also have stuff you trash you left over your quals and your tripleai
__label__False ok in some case the origo is the same a the reference object
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False if yeah if you add the c delta comp delta computation which is done afterwards
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and that sort of bypass the whole the whole jimbox thing and all that
__label__False and then uh so that s log of x plus log of one plus uh
__label__False um ok so there s digit alignment and um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah because you can get a number uh for that with the other a well right you can turn those thing off right
__label__False i estimate mean and variance for each one of the gaussian of the codebook
__label__False i mean it s just mechanism the nice thing about cv is that you can have multiple people modifying and if the change do nt overlap each other they can just do it
__label__False so it s then we wan na make a proof of concept for
__label__False uh
__label__False b
__label__False so it s they re not compatible
__label__False right
__label__False bakery bakery
__label__False but in any case um thi this is this wa transcribed in a in a uh le optimal way than than the one that came after it and i wa able to you know an and this meant that there were some speaker identif identification which were change yeah
__label__False so
__label__False o zero one two four one o four o five three four nine nine six o
__label__False yeah because it s noise also
__label__False so you d have to like figure out
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the spectral subtraction is being done at what level is it being done at the level of fft bin or at the level of uh mel spectrum or something
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah it s slow
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok um
__label__False the other thing we could do actually uh is uh use them for a more detailed analysis of the overlap
__label__False yeah i guess that s probably next yeah
__label__False i thought it wa one gigabyte
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh i do nt think we ve been doing it at that level of detail
__label__False i want u to assume the exac whatever it wa you assumed when you did the other the the close mike
__label__False yeah i think that s it
__label__False right it s the it s right the so yeah so it s sort of like the tandem stuff is kind of like i nonlinear lda i g yeah
__label__False o
__label__False or real usually
__label__True darpa mee
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False is
__label__False ok if you could just leave um your mike on top of your uh digit form i can fill in any information that s missing
__label__False ok
__label__False then if we can improve the noise estimation then it should get better
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean
__label__False yep
__label__False o o nine nine eight eight eight
__label__False me
__label__False uh that s another parameter right that that maybe you know uh you really want three or nine or
__label__False ok so let s get started nancy said she s coming and that mean she will be
__label__False i think
__label__False so what wa the what wa the threshold part of it wa the threshold uh how far down
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False eight zero two eight nine seven nine one
__label__False and that will he keep it from flopping aro up and down a much
__label__False but let me tell you how i really feel
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False indeed
__label__False yeah i ve i ve i m very well acquainted with this meeting
__label__False ok
__label__False hav have you ever t
__label__False they were three off basically
__label__False i mean it
__label__False oh and suddenly also the v the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se on the test data
__label__False and asking which one we were on this week
__label__False in term of it being window versus but i m just wondering is
__label__False well they re twentyfive cent or so yeah
__label__False oh ok
__label__False right right right i mean the um
__label__False ok
__label__False and then we re um
__label__False that would be like that d be like him he s great
__label__False real although i think what we re specifying here is this is a category where the action enter view and approach would fall into because they have a related sourcepathgoal schema in our tourist domain
__label__False yeah m um well i m gon na f work with timit
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False what um when you display it on the web page what are what are you showing them utterance or
__label__False and reference object and um
__label__False it s oh ok so they re not talking about how far apart the mike are they re talking about how far they are from the speaker
__label__False hmm
__label__False well that s obviously just to do with our probability like we totally handtuned the probability right we were like
__label__False because there are interdependency right
__label__False and these experiment also are using uh some kind of noise compensation so spectral subtraction and putting online normalization um just after this so i think spectral subtraction lda filtering and online normalization so which is similar to the pro proposalone but with spectral subtraction in addition and it seems that online normalization doe nt help further when you have spectral subtraction
__label__False yeah
__label__False he he already well i probably most likely without knowing this this evidence uh is talking about these small scale space that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental space
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so with that maybe we should uh go to our
__label__False huh
__label__False i think everybody wa focused elsewhere
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah i will send you the the final version which is not
__label__False this is
__label__False ok
__label__False the french telecom
__label__False yeah
__label__False sorry
__label__False ok did you solve speech recognition last week
__label__False i
__label__False yeah
__label__False one thing that s kind of been bugging me when i more i look at this is that the
__label__False well i mean the cd are are an op
__label__False yeah and since the file are short it s just
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False if if raw speed is the problem this thing is written in tcl right
__label__False and you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo
__label__False right now it s brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make t twenty change on on on on seventeen module before they actually can stomach it anything
__label__False um i do nt i uh i do nt need it um actually this is the the newest version after your comment and
__label__False good for security yeah ok good good point
__label__False but it s it s easy to make up plausible one
__label__False spike
__label__False i i need to s i do nt know exactly
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False i wanted to see sort of how the um how these model were coming out you know what w when we train up uh th you know the model for one which want to have nine state you know what is the uh what do the transition probability look like in the selfloops look like in in those model
__label__False right
__label__False and say some of them have like three possibility and all that so you re thinking like like a hundred and forty four or something possible thing number to enter right so
__label__False ok
__label__False uh at one point uh brian and i went downstairs into the the basement where it wa it wa in a hallway where it wa very reverberant and we we made some recording there and then we we uh uh made a simulation of the of the room acoustic there and and applied it to other thing and uh
__label__False um the
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False just say ok in the in the highlymatched case this is what happens in the m the uh this other m medium if this happens in the highlymismatched that happens
__label__False yes i mean sure you do need to know i mean to have that kind of information
__label__False that s why we should have a loo more closer look at what s going on
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s not very significant
__label__False well the the
__label__False but i felt that in a real situation we were very seldom gon na get people to really do it and maybe it wa nt worth concentrating on
__label__False right
__label__False well i i i he s pretty close anyway i think i think it s
__label__False um
__label__False sorry guy
__label__False yeah run into might even be more impact sense than you know container sense
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False uh i mean first place there s still this thing to to work out and second place second thing is that the only result that we have so far from before were really development set result
__label__False and what these number refer to is the number of time that the uh hmm reestimation is run it s this program called herest
__label__False oh it s clear i should have gi given other result also it s clear when you do nt add noise it s much worse like around five percent worse i guess
__label__False really fast but it s running linux so you can now run your experiment on that machine and you can run five at a time and it run uh a fast a you know uh five different machine
__label__False there wa who
__label__False yeah well i think it s uh it it could be a number of thing it could be touching and fiddling and the other thing is that it could the fact that it s on a wired mike is suspicious it might be a connector
__label__False but there are fewer i think there are fewer uhhuhs i mean just from we were looking at word frequency list to try to find the case that we would allow to have the reject word in between in doing the alignment
__label__False see woman are nothi are trouble right a we all know so
__label__False transcript l three ten seven eight nine three nine two one five o five o five four two three one seven nine eight zero eight nine zero three one eight six seven three five six two one o seven one one nine two six eight two six seven seven three two five nine o four seven seven four six six three eight one nine five six three two one one zero three two seven seven six six three o two
__label__False right
__label__False anyway we also tried absorbing that into the pause model i mean the the the model that that match the stuff between word
__label__False so is uh is that about it
__label__False right
__label__False it s ambiguous so it s ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False you know what they can their four oclock cancelled and they re starting at four twenty and i ll set up at four fifteen
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah he s he s he s at motorola now
__label__False l forty four
__label__False then we do nt really have to talk about that a an i i take that off the agenda
__label__False yeah
__label__False i should probably beep that out in case john osterhout ever listens but
__label__False um
__label__False yeah it should be pretty close to cancelled out
__label__False that s right but something that what i mean is something that is very distinguishable from speech
__label__False yeah so it s possible to get very short latency but again we re the the approach that we re using are one that take advantage of
__label__False well y i i do nt know that i would trust that so much because you re doing these canonical mapping from timit labelings right so really that s sort of a cartoon picture about what s voiced and unvoiced so that could be giving you a lot of variance
__label__False right
__label__False you wan na say ok give me the posterior probability of the gothere node when this is happening
__label__False so the interaction beforehand will give them hint about how specific or how whatever though the kind of question that are going to ask during the actual session
__label__False but if the htk i mean i think they re both
__label__False cool
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False because it it s noninteractive and so the only way to do that is with uh
__label__False icsi meeting transcription convention
__label__False but on the other hand and maybe maybe it s a decent idea
__label__False really
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few week and what do you come up with
__label__False uh clean tidigits is like pretty pristine training data and if they trained the sri system on this
__label__False this the portion that are more silent a you add a white noise that are ha a very high energy it whitens everything and and the highenergy portion of the speech do nt get much affected anyway by the other noise and a the noise you add is the same is the shape it s also the same
__label__False yeah
__label__True wait so you re saying next tuesday is it the whole group meeting or just u three working on it or or
__label__False yeah yeah ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok and i mean and the whole point of it wa not that it wa good to increase your error rate but it wa good to be willing to risk increasing your error rate by trying risky thing and trying because there s this notion of a local minimum that if you just have some system that s very complex and you t you you turn some knob to try to make it better and better you ll never get out of this local minimum you have to be willing to jump to something that s quite different and the first time you jump to something quite different or maybe the first ten time or a hundred time you do it s gon na be much much worse because you ve optimized the other system
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and let the uh uh statistical system determine what s the right way to look at the data
__label__False there s no way
__label__False no
__label__False oh
__label__False and you were my gsi briefly until i dropped the class
__label__False this is something that we already noticed before when mmm
__label__False wizard
__label__False and so the other thing i sh she wanted to display the stylized f zero i think they re called
__label__True let s look at the beliefnet ok so that mean that i should switch to the other program
__label__False easy parser
__label__False yeah
__label__True but uh i do you guy have any vacation plan because i myself am going to be um gone but this is actually not really important just this weekend we re going camping
__label__True can you maximize the window so all that stuff on the side is nt doe nt appear
__label__False yep
__label__False that s done you have to change those strategy right that s ten word
__label__False well
__label__False it s not it s just something that s fixed yeah mmhmm um
__label__False there wa actually there wa much le of a huge range than there wa in aurora one
__label__False yeah right it s a if we did nt tell anyone at all right
__label__False unit
__label__False but i think you have i mean you have twenty for delta computation which y now you re sort of doing twice right but yo w were you doing that before
__label__False like the endpoint is not necessarily relevant in the bayesnet for whereis until after you ve decided whether you wan na go there or not
__label__False six seven one three seven nine four five one
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i see
__label__False do we h do we have uh um
__label__False uh
__label__False uh but you re a linguist you should
__label__False can we um
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh friday uh
__label__False so i mean there s these issue of what are the what are the variable that you use and do you combine them using the soft andor or you do something you know more complicated um and then the other thing wa so where do you get the target from
__label__True well i ve been continuing reading i went off on a little tangent this past week um looking at uh uh modulation s spectrum stuff um and and learning a bit about what what um what it is and uh the importance of it in speech recognition and i found some some uh neat paper um historical paper from um kanedera hermansky and arai
__label__False what what wa on his queue for recognition experiment
__label__False i think this is the same point we were at when when we were up in oregon
__label__False right
__label__False we were not saying we are not doing it we wer we just wanted to do
__label__False but
__label__False but it would be interesting to see if that wa the problem anyway
__label__False right um
__label__False mmm yeah
__label__False the other topic i wa thinking of wa the sta status on microphone and channel and all that
__label__False that that s the that s about the result and uh the summary is like ok so there are the other thing what i tried wa which i explained in the last meeting is using the channel zero for uh for both dropping and estimating the noise
__label__False yeah so the way i did that i i just measured the average speech energy of the all the italian data
__label__False to to handle
__label__False so it s just an additional information
__label__False so if
__label__False would you would you wan na do this kind of uh difference thing after you do spectral subtraction
__label__False well i ll talk to dave and and see what th how what the best way of doing that is
__label__False you could get it out of there or some
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False all noisy yeah
__label__False you re gon na say y you re gon na say g go down that way
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah all the kid ll love it
__label__False ah no this is this more close is this
__label__False and then there would it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable
__label__False or
__label__False you know we
__label__False well they re gon na have to have account
__label__False we re we re trying i
__label__False crosscorrelation
__label__False the idea is there s this uh other subgroup that s worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation but sort of in parallel with that uh the hope is tha in particularly you will work on construction in english ge and german for this domain but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into smartkom or any of the other anything lik any other constraint for the time being
__label__False w what happen with the second step
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and so while discussing about these these lda filter some i issue appeared like well the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filter it s uh well we do nt know really what s the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that in the very low frequency these filter do nt do nt really remove a lot compared to the to the uh standard rasta filter
__label__False seven four one two six o six o seven seven two one seven five three nine six five three eight seven two one five six eight eight nine nine four nine nine five four two six five seven o two
__label__False that s interesting
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False or you prefer now before after
__label__False ok
__label__False um i had another question briefly about transcription so are we going get an external service or are we gon na do it i mean who s gon na generate the transcript
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False why do nt you go ahead dave
__label__False oh no there s one more issue bhaskara brought that one up meeting time rescheduling
__label__False and again you did experiment back then where you made it bigger and it and that wa that wa sort of the threshold point much le than that it wa worse and much more than that it wa nt much better
__label__False yes
__label__True and um we wo nt meet next monday
__label__False so and that s you know each time you go there it s updated so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False eva
__label__False he want to know where it is
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and got some very impressive result um with you know discriminative uh gaussian training
__label__False i think at the frame level for fiftysix that wa the kind of number we were getting for for uh um reduced band width uh stuff
__label__False so um since we have a bit farther to travel than some of the others uh we ll have to get done a little quicker
__label__False yeah
__label__False kind of a clean up thing that ok
__label__False so you re so you have a system which for one reason or another is relatively poor and and uh you have something like fortyone percent error uh and then you transform it to eight by doing doing this this work
__label__False c
__label__False ok so i would try to i would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff
__label__False and um the other system were uh somewhat lower than that
__label__False i make a mistake when i write up at d i copy one of the bad result
__label__False uh you assume everything s equal i mean y y i mean you
__label__False well there there there should never be a hard coded uh shortcut from the bakery question to the uh double schema thing how uh and a a matter of fact when i have traveled with my friend we make these exactly these kind of appointment
__label__False are not
__label__False maybe you can read in
__label__False yeah voicedunvoiced hopefully would be a lot better
__label__False uh it s been a while
__label__False this is why we we started to look by having sort of voiced phoneme and
__label__False yeah
__label__True and then do some segmenting and recognition initial recognition would be interesting to do
__label__False oh
__label__False we
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s one net with um twentyseven output if we have twentyseven class yeah
__label__False i mean that s what we wan na check right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False mmm
__label__False but it s the thing is it s that that that s that s i i
__label__False um well that s that s one one thing is that we can link up think also that um we can have one or m a many a we want link from from the schema up to the s action um description of it
__label__False yeah
__label__False um i it s a little behind it s the same syntax but it s a little behind in that
__label__False right
__label__False and al it also mmhmm
__label__False uh well this doe nt help neither but this doe nt hurt so well
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh i could tell you had a rough day man
__label__False uh
__label__False that s a good idea
__label__False right
__label__False oh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and another wad wa a um sort of like a sample a sample run
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i just took their entire italian training part so it wa both channel zero plus channel one
__label__False zero nine nine zero
__label__False yeah right ok
__label__False please specify
__label__False look ok so let s i mean c equal a plus b and then
__label__False yeah i know but how do we weight what we get out
__label__False vad performance
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh so it s two hundred and ten yeah
__label__False well we do nt it doe nt need to be backed up
__label__False actually
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no i do nt use that i ca nt use
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__True i mean i ve i ve seen the this this is called praat praat which i guess mean spee speech in dutch or something
__label__False yeah that s true
__label__False that s true it ll that s right so you really do wan na be using a machine that s not
__label__False right
__label__False alrighty
__label__False guaranteed it s just uh will i be here you know in uh i ll be here too actually but
__label__False i did that for for five minute of one dialogue and that wa enough to to train the system and so it it adapts uh on while running so
__label__True uh i ll look it up and say it to you
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False combine error rate and then yeah
__label__False so
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False and the best result of any system wa about fiftyfour where these number are the uh relative uh reduction in uh word error rate
__label__False well no i mean it s uh four gigabyte for forty minute
__label__False and a part of that um
__label__False ok
__label__False so i th i think that the key file is usefu for notation related to the meeting but it s different from the transcript
__label__False ok
__label__False and uh ibm people also just let u know i mean
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False the beep file actually the shorten doe nt save a whole lot
__label__False so i i do nt know if there there s obviously some m more than one way of organizing the variable into something so
__label__False well ultimately we re gon na need to build one anyway
__label__False i i found that nnn that eh ehm pr probably
__label__False i i i i wa thinking of looking into that the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion in fact is that it s even possible since of course many radio show are not live uh that we could invite them to have like some of their record some of their show here
__label__False ok
__label__False so i i think the the advantage of going with the neural net thing is that we re gon na use the neural net training no matter what for a lot of the thing we re doing whereas w exactly which
__label__False but it ha the uh the latency are much shorter that s
__label__False well but that involves mucking with the backend which is not allowed
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep it just ha just hang down there yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False i can read i m kidding
__label__False so we got ta do all this so there s that and then there s also a set of system thing that come up
__label__False then we then we might conclude that he actually want to just know where uh t uh he doe want to go there
__label__False no no no i i consider all the all the session because eh i i count the nnn the nnn the overlapping marked by by jane in in in in the fin in in the fortyfive minute
__label__False wha what about i in so the the go ahead
__label__False or
__label__False oh i it feel like your a if your uh neuron had extended themselves out to this tool and you re feeling force on it and so forth and and you deal directly with it
__label__False uh no i m just you know being a manager this week so
__label__False yes i do nt know
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah that s good u
__label__False there s there s there s gon na be debugging hassle and then we d be set for when we did have five or eight to have it really be useful
__label__False i mean it seems like nothing is context free
__label__False well so it s a reference performance that we can you know if we want to to work on the vad we can work on this basis and
__label__False got a good core group now
__label__False so if if they do nt know doe nt that suggest the way for them to go
__label__False um but uh
__label__False uh
__label__False about the transcriber or anything or i do nt know
__label__False ok
__label__False because this way i can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand
__label__False so
__label__False because uh
__label__False but i do nt think we re gon na stop at the end of this semester
__label__False so
__label__False so uh where are we maybe uh uh brief
__label__False i mean when we put the neural network
__label__False mike jordan and i asked john ohala and he agreed
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False i guess i guess if you re keeping the backend fixed
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that ll work
__label__False and the result in the end wa no different
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i also have this i i think it s nice you have it uh viewab her hearable on the on the web for those who might wonder about um the non nonverbal side i mean i i agree that our bias should be a a expressed here and but
__label__False well i i think
__label__False it s a lot like it um
__label__False we ab th
__label__False maybe we can work on doing displaying multiple or displaying one and playing back the other
__label__False how big is the net by the way
__label__False right
__label__False then you could end up with a real mess in term of like consistency of convention across a file there is an argument to be made for having a single editor editing at that level
__label__False yeah that s true yeah
__label__False i m sure vary from place to place but i think the ideally it seems to me anyway that you you would wan na do the same thing in training a you do in test
__label__False so also andreas on that one the the back part of it should be right against your head
__label__False but the only caveat to that is that everybody s being real conscious of how much memory and how much cpu they re using because these uh standard are supposed to go on cell phone with m moderate resource in both respect
__label__False sorry i wa just reading the screen
__label__False one
__label__False are they
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah we really ca nt but a actually i m sorry i really would like to push finish this off so it s
__label__False from the discourse that
__label__False transcript l one one six eight two six four four five one nine nine one three one one eight seven three six seven one one seven eight two eight three eight zero three eight two nine two seven five eight four three zero nine nine seven zero nine four four eight four four seven four seven six four one eight eight nine nine eight seven three two four six four three one nine two eight four seven six two four o four five nine six five one
__label__False there s all sort of stuff going on so let s so let s think about this from the point of view of construal so let s first do a so the metonymy thing is probably the easiest and a and actually the
__label__False yeah i have to tell you for the uh for the admin meeting that we have lila doe that um every time before an admin meeting
__label__False so if you look at the spectral envelope just the very smooth property of it you get something closer to that
__label__False let me
__label__True so ok we re not using their system that mean we need our system right it it follows and so uh in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right and the formalism and stuff we re actually gon na build something and uh johno is point person on the parser analyzer whatever that is and we re gon na start on that in parallel with the um the grammar stuff but to do that we re gon na need to make some decision like ontology so um and so this is another thing where we re gon na you know have to get involved and make s relatively early i think make some decision on uh is there an ontology api that that there s a sort of standard way of getting thing from ontology and we build the parser and stuff around that or is there a particular ontology that we re gon na standardize on and if so for example is there something that we can use there i doe uh either the uh smartkom project or one of the project at eml have something that we can just p pull out for that
__label__False um
__label__False ok so i guess that s
__label__False oh so in switzerland
__label__False uh
__label__False i wa going crazy trying to do that
__label__False hmm
__label__False is that right log of
__label__False and ok ok
__label__False n well
__label__False oh
__label__False um liz also volunteered to be the first subject which i think might be even better than u guy
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False and then the lower part is for italian and it s the same the same thing
__label__False th there s some i impetus at um
__label__False did you do different language from digit
__label__False everything is probablistic and
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well we can find out i know for instance mark liberman wa interested uh in in ldc getting data uh and
__label__False yeah the lda lda we do nt know is like is it very crucial for the feature right
__label__True and then the other issue jane and i spoke of briefly is just general permission issue
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False but um those are interesting example but it s not clear that they re mainly construal example
__label__False you know did that person ever discus admission fee fee in his entire life
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False yeah they re in the pmake pool so if you do a reginfo minus show attribute and uh
__label__False uh what else
__label__False radio two
__label__False oh i meant this you know like
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False well or the thing is they re not a averse to wearing one of these headmount i mean they re on the radio right so
__label__False alright
__label__False yeah essentially yeah
__label__False ok so what happens is um at each one of these point you increase the number of gaussians in the model
__label__False how well doe an aurora system do on on you know on digit collected in a in this environment yeah
__label__False and uh you know you can
__label__False and yeah
__label__False but well it s similar
__label__False yeah
__label__True when do you leave
__label__False yeah the other thing we were talking about also is once we exp once the disk ha been backed up we do nt actually need it online
__label__False even though
__label__False yeah
__label__False i i want to see what it doe with uh landmarkiness
__label__False it is y
__label__False yeah basically your ear are too big i mean mine are too
__label__False because if you have a long word and you re training it to eighteen state uh you ve got you know you ve got the same number of
__label__False yeah something like that
__label__False so y you do nt wan na use one that s
__label__False oh
__label__False but but this backup system is smart enough to figure out that something ha nt changed and doe nt need to be backedup again
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False they might have blown it up
__label__False and i do nt have it quite right but that kind of thing where you have to draw the inference that ok there s this time sequence but also the the the causal aspect of the uh floor and and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it wa the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it these sort of thing so
__label__False yeah i m thinking also a w about
__label__False if you look at it individually what it really say is that there s um uh
__label__False boy that s ab i had never i had nt even thought about that
__label__False no
__label__False three o o
__label__False observe node
