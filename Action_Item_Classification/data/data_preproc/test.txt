__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yes but if you do that then someone who is nt the owner ca nt unchange it
__label__False third column is the um start time of the word and the fourth column is the duration of the word
__label__False yeah that s what i wa thinking but but um then there s the sixtyfour
__label__False of nondigits
__label__False yeah really
__label__False need the closetalking mike
__label__False die duke von hazard
__label__False right
__label__False is there le training data
__label__False ok well i do nt why do nt we why d u why do nt we uh uh turn them turn the
__label__False i mean we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded viterbi uh so there is some something that s suggested based on the data but it s it s not
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh yeah we t we t w we t we talked about that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i think he ha a class yeah
__label__False well uh
__label__False a a long a there is an indication that there wa laughter somewhere between two word
__label__False is is that right
__label__False well
__label__False do you assume you know the speaker when you do this
__label__False so i think we have a version that s pretty good for the native speaker i do nt know yet about the nonnative speaker
__label__False doe it
__label__False yeah but i do nt know if it s still
__label__False maybe it wa sue y
__label__False ok
__label__False but we re trying to expand this right
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so s i i you know a lot of these thing are proprietary so we re doing a little bit of guesswork here i mean what do comp what do people do who really face these problem in the field well they have company and they do nt tell other people exactly what they do but but i mean when you the the hint that you get from what they when they talk about it are that they do they all do something like this
__label__False sure it ok yeah
__label__False so in other word this data collection is more general it could it could be used for not just this task
__label__False um well actually th um
__label__False instruction oh direction yeah oh i thought that wa definitely treated a an example of construal
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False how do you write the code or do you actually never have to write any code there
__label__False list all the parent category
__label__False yes
__label__False suppose the information you added well wa a really terrible feature and all it brought in wa noise
__label__False farfield yeah
__label__False so they add a random random noise to it
__label__False um because there s gon na be data coming from uw hopefully by then
__label__False i do nt know if you even want to run the big one uh um in the in the final system cuz you know it take a little while to run it so um you can scale it down by
__label__False i think given at the level you re doing thing in floating point on the computer i do nt think it matter would be my guess but
__label__True so we ll skip next week and we ll meet two week from now
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__True and then if ti if there s time i wanted to talk about digit but it looked like we were pretty full so i can wait till next week
__label__False the the we have the vad flag i mean should we f feed the vad flag also at the input so that it it ha some additional discriminating information at the input
__label__False ok
__label__False i ll be back on tuesday
__label__False what i ve done so far and i wan na get some opinion on how to how to finish it up
__label__False so uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False and if we look at the result that sunil sent just putting the vad in the baseline improved like more than twenty percent which would mean then then mean that fifty percent on this new baseline is like well more than sixty percent improvement on on o e e uh
__label__False here is a here is
__label__False yeah
__label__False well i do nt know
__label__False and so if you re interested in
__label__False so i got actually just the result for the italian for that and that s like
__label__False so
__label__False and then there is there are more input that come from the tandem mlp
__label__False yep
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False tran
__label__False which mean that we were nt actually running it on on uh on data that had had no speech
__label__False yeah that s what i thought i it s probably just you know mmm somehow the audio device get hung for a second or
__label__False it wa helping uh if the feature are b were bad i mean
__label__False shosts which is insecure
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False i ca nt remember what his name wa
__label__False sorry i got the wavefile but i could nt get the word yet but the the wavefile part look look good
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah just work with the model yeah
__label__False is it the guy that wa using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or
__label__False that s the only thing with them but the quality seems really good and
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yes
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False in fact the first thing that i do is to to obtain uh an expression for e probability e expression of of e that mean that the vt mmm with the vt we obtain uh
__label__False oh oh oh oh oh oh i see
__label__False against they could do forced alignment
__label__False it s one mixture of the model right
__label__False well it wa just amazing to to see uh how how instable the whole thing is and if you just take the
__label__False uh and that you know anything that you do over here should be at least a good a that
__label__False hmm
__label__False only one of those thing are gon na be lit up when we pas this on
__label__False so the question is s w
__label__False um
__label__False um but for the most of the word are sh much shorter
__label__False an which is the right way to do it i mean when we did our first experiment and i wa uh creating sri feature file from the icsi frontend i just had perl script you know and hacked a bunch of stuff together just to get it going but the r the right way to do it is to integrate it in with the icsi tool and so that s what i m doing now and so once i get that done then i ll generate the pfiles i need cuz we already have the feature file in the sri format so what i need to do is make it so that the the quicknet stuff can read those and uh
__label__False try try what
__label__False yeah
__label__False well th th
__label__False nnn yeah
__label__False i love that story
__label__False ok
__label__False um i think especially since you you have nt been in in these meeting for a little bit maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible thing to look at now that we re starting to get data uh and one of the thing i know that also came up uh is some discussion that that uh that uh jane had with lokendra uh about some some some um uh work about
__label__False to say i am cheating in this experiment is not saying that the data is bad it s saying that my experiment is bad
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False sure
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False great
__label__False it s the single net yeah
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False right and then we do nt know
__label__False yeah
__label__False six one zero one one nine zero nine two
__label__True i mean what what s maybe we should what are our action item so there s there s the continuing process of cleaning up the stuff and making it easier to do that
__label__False so and jeff uh the two jeffs were
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh they are relevant but um i for a demo you wo nt see it
__label__False so
__label__False well the numbered one would make it a lot easier cuz you could then really localize where the error is
__label__False so w when you start up i mean you start up with the with the somehow with the noisy envelope
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False so it s uh
__label__False uh what s the difference in if you were trying to construct a linear filter that would um
__label__False oh yeah oh yeah
__label__False i do nt really have anything specific to to talk about
__label__False so just
__label__False and um his uh the way that the
__label__False oh but that s not specific to meeting recorder i wa gon na say i took some a suggestion of adam s and i um created a m cgi script that let you see the current status of the speech disk
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False almost
__label__False pruning
__label__False yeah i ve been um
__label__False wizard
__label__False right
__label__False i think i m channel two
__label__False c we
__label__False that did nt work
__label__False unless you are whatever his his divorce lawyer or something yeah and um
__label__False nice coinage
__label__False and i ve got some some kind of manual down in my office
__label__False circuit
__label__False well better hurry up then
__label__False no no no it s not the first space well we have pfft uh em
__label__False because you have to know which one match which
__label__False oh
__label__False right
__label__False well we should be getting new equipment in so we do nt have to use the earplug any more
__label__False yeah
__label__False and it seemed like he chose it a bit informally so um with the with the htk setup i should be able to do some experiment on just varying that length say between one and three second in a few different reverberation condition um say this room and also a few of the artificial impulse response we have for reverberation just um making some plot and seeing how they look
__label__False six two nine one two six four five six seven six one
__label__False no no praat
__label__False four eight two seven four nine five five eight
__label__False there are like three connector in the circuit
__label__False and using the thing that you wrote up
__label__False ok well i guess we re about done um so some of the digit form do nt have digit
__label__False line out yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean i might even mention that this work you re doing is sort of also with the mpi in leipzig so
__label__False yeah
__label__False so specifically the u w folk have been wanting to get access to it so i think the right thing to do for that is figure out how to do cv without uh compromising security some pas ssh tunneled
__label__False no it doe nt say it at all no
__label__False did he
__label__False right
__label__False yeah so i guess we ge we had better be on call for a little while
__label__False can you see the breathing cuz i
__label__False reminds me of when th when herve and i were first playing with c uh contextdependent thing for net and and at one point we took out the speech input so we only had prior and our performance went up
__label__False um
__label__False i wa just curious about where we are compared to you know the shortest that people have done
__label__False and and you and you train it up entirely from uh nonspeech section in the test
__label__False it look good
__label__False i mean how doe it know which syntactic structure to pull out and all that
__label__False i do nt have
__label__False uh so
__label__False yeah
__label__False and you also provided me with several different version which i compared
__label__False no actually what here s here s what we would usually do u under these circumstance
__label__True the whole group
__label__False yeah the semester s late late august they start here
__label__False yeah
__label__False so what we re doing uh this this is just maybe someone ha s some some idea about how to do it better but we
__label__False mmm there were other minor difference the fact that she used fifteen dissities instead s instead of thirteen and that she used czero instead of log energy
__label__False it s all tape robot so you just sit down at your computer and you type a command
__label__False uh so for for
__label__False h what
__label__False good
__label__False um
__label__False well so you do nt have to release it to the world until you re ready to
__label__False and i guess fr uh
__label__False transcript two two five one dash two two seven zero nine seven one
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False b you me you mean um ta
__label__False i
__label__False year or two
__label__False uh that s the party line
__label__False ascii line by line format but it doe give you information
__label__False five six one four nine six three six four six
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False so seventy point two mean that we reduced the error rate uh by thirty thirty percent so
__label__False cool
__label__False yeah
__label__False um because then anything that s a cue for one of the step would be slight evidence for that overall plan
__label__False you think i did nt s tell him that
__label__False right
__label__False but
__label__False are nt we always computing all
__label__True well dan montello sort of he he doe the uh uh th the cognitive map world down in santa barbara
__label__False hmm metaphorically
__label__False action that can be categorized with or that are related to sourcepathgoal
__label__False no right this is right
__label__False no that s a that s a that s an arg that s an ar well that s an argument for it but let me give you the opposite argument the opposite argument is you re never really gon na have a good sample of all these different thing
__label__False yeah
__label__True oh the what we talked about yesterday yeah that wa actually my i wa wearing the
__label__False i want to go to a bakery
__label__False and so you know i ve i ve sat here and watched sometimes the breathing and the bar going up and down and i m thinking
__label__False we had some good one earlier
__label__False ok
__label__False um
__label__False yeah this is totally like the probability and all are completely adhoc we need to look at all of them
__label__False cuz we had this one collaboration with cmu and we used sphinx
__label__False oh that s the f the original
__label__False so which is near saturation apparently
__label__False at th at the input i mean that s at the input to the net
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yes it is allowed
__label__False ok
__label__False oh so you d really want to do it before right
__label__False you ca nt miss it
__label__False mmm
__label__False actually it wa not a threshold it wa just adding noise
__label__False but
__label__False but uh you know so we ll see what it is comparatively later
__label__False so
__label__True so there ll be no definitely no meeting on on september sixth
__label__False yeah it s there mmhmm
__label__False uh how much are we talking about here
__label__False ok the the tea is is going so uh i suggest we do uh uh a unison
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False alright
__label__False becomes flat
__label__False um
__label__False i try to have a time constant that s smaller at the beginning of the utterance to adapt more quickly to the r something that s closer to the right mean
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False at least at least for the first for the wellmatched yeah
__label__False yeah and it wa a hundredish
__label__False ok
__label__False twenty hertz frequency
__label__False well if right
__label__True ok then let s meet meet again next tuesday
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False in ge in in in a general point of view in the per
__label__False well no i i guess my question is
__label__False and you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test and s more if you do it on both training and test
__label__True ben i think it s ben actually yeah um giving his job talk i think um
__label__False yeah i may i may hold off but if i wa eh but maybe i ll get some later
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it wa the same system
__label__False or a link to it
__label__False they do oh oh i would jus
__label__False that s cool
__label__False so we ll set that up
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmmmm
__label__False i mean it s they have all these data from the close mike and from the distant mike from different driving condition open window closed window and they take all of this and they take seventy percent i think for training and thirty percent for testing
__label__False oh yeah so w we did nt yet specify with whom but um
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah uh actually it s true uh i had forgotten this uh but uh wellmatched is not actually clean what it is is just that u uh the training and testing are similar
__label__False given this this uh regular old net that s just for choosing for other purpose uh add up the probability of the different subclass and see see how well you do
__label__False uh eight week uh is
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False ye
__label__False and they although they do nt talk about it in this note um there s um the issue of the um mu law business uh versus the logarithm um so
__label__False because it would be a different kind of meeting that s what i m
__label__False you know it wa nt that bad it wa just doing certain thing wrong so but i do nt you know have time to l to look at all of them and it would be really useful to have like a a transcriber who could use wave um just mark like the beginning and end of the foreground speaker s real word like the beginning of the first word the end of the last word and then we could you know do some adjustment
__label__False i see
__label__False i i would really like someone to do adaptation so if we got someone interested in that i think it would be great for meeting recorder
__label__False vtl estimation
__label__False i actually do nt see how you get that
__label__False so what what what s the deal with with your
__label__False yeah and and tell her you know
__label__False right
__label__False but we do nt really know what we re interested in before we look at the complete at at the overall result
__label__False yeah
__label__False these data are available but these are imperfect because of the f you know the battery flaked
__label__False i looked at them i spent two day um in wave
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False already right right right
__label__False and so there s gon na be delay of a week before we get that third one back and i ve already given him three more to work on but he said those new three wo nt get done until this big chunk of data ha been processed by the company
__label__False basman yeah it s because of the chessplayer named michael basman who is my hero
__label__False i see
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i think what i wa sort of saying is that if you just say
__label__False so uh yeah well why do nt you just put it on the web page there s this edu right
__label__False so
__label__False well i think that s a good idea
__label__False but he did nt so
__label__False so the lowest value for this would be zero so y you re restricted to being positive
__label__False but presumably you ll see something that wo nt have this kind of uh uh uh regularity in frequency uh in the
__label__False wan na
__label__False something more adaptive yeah
__label__False did you join the club
__label__False maybe
__label__False and then um the other thing which i would like to talk about which is a real metaquest i think deal is uh agenda
__label__False and
__label__False so basically the mean is adapted during speech and not during silence
__label__False ta
__label__False you do nt have to use the acronym
__label__False ok
__label__True so they would like clean channel
__label__False it s just saying a a baseline we know you know we had the mfcc s before lot of people have done voice activity detector you might a well pick some voice activity detector and make that the baseline just like you picked some version of htk and made that the baseline
__label__False so the question is how close to that one can you get if you transform the data using that system
__label__False twothirtyish or three or friday at three or something around that time
__label__False lot of silence
__label__False the the reason
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False have you ever tried this exact same recognizer out on the actual tidigits test set
__label__False ah
__label__False i i improve my result using clean lda filter
__label__True what s a shape file
__label__False anyway um uh the ha ha uh been exploring uh e largely the energy issue and um a with a lot of thing it is not uh like this it s not a simple a it sound and then there s you know is it energy is it log energy is it lpc residual energy is it is it is it uh delta of those thing uh what is it no obviously just a simple number absolute number is nt gon na work so it should be with compared to what should there be a long window for the normalizing factor and a short window for what you re looking at or you know how b short should they be so th he s been playing around with a lot of these different thing and and so far at least ha not come up with any combination that really gave you an indicator so
__label__False yes
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that d be that d be nice i mean
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False to timit
__label__False so we can actually triple that
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so someone s gon na talk to brian
__label__False ok alright
__label__False we c we can find out
__label__False alright
__label__False i do nt not necessarily i would think i mean it s not based on construction it s based on thing like uh there s gon na be a node for gothere or not and there s gon na be a node for enter view approach
__label__False that s great yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh
__label__False sp blahblahblah and then silence at the end
__label__False and
__label__False this may have been what i wa asking before stephane but but um wa nt there something that you did where you trained on one language and tested on another
__label__False but it s cheating in a way that s pril it s it s announcing to everybody hey i m cheating by doing this
__label__False the one that we s we submitted the last round
__label__False um
__label__False so there is this there is the um length of the filter
__label__False ok i wa like huh it wa here like um
__label__False so that the the analogy wa you have map of different thing at different resolution
__label__False great ok it s uh two thousand eleven twentyone one thousand
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False wha what s tidigits i thought t
__label__False e hhh
__label__False yep
__label__False no i the audio file you can specify any sampling rate
__label__False just make a
__label__False is it are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event or are you calling the entire length of it the event
__label__False ok
__label__False mmm
__label__False that s all
__label__False no we wo nt
__label__False yeah that s right beep that out
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and then we can r uh possibly run one of them uh transformation
__label__False that would nt be disappointing
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False good
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False we could manipulate the source itself or
__label__False so uh
__label__False that s connected
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean that s more of an information kind of thing
__label__False one two three
__label__False one six eight six two four zero one three
__label__False no we like when people do this kind of thing
__label__False information technology research something like that
__label__False i have to what
__label__False one six six one o four eight nine eight five
__label__True and i remember one thing that that came up in the talk last wednesday
__label__False yeah yeah right
__label__False so maybe if that doe nt work um
__label__False hmm that s an interesting idea
__label__False no no just just start whenever you want
__label__False i wanted to ask another a a aspect of the data collection there d be no reason why a person could nt get together several uh you know friend and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to right
__label__False mayb
__label__False or a printedout form
__label__False um or also for dialogue of various sort
__label__False ok
__label__False so then afterwards a log is taken and that s so sort of why the the little variation tends to go away
__label__False so uh even we do nt do anything else doing something like this could allow u to turn experiment around a lot faster
__label__False we re from each alignment we re producing uh one of these ctm file which essentially ha it s just a linear sequence of word with the begin time for every word and the duration
__label__False he had a problem right
__label__False right
__label__False yep
__label__False well someone someone might be interested in in it
__label__True and brian s coming so that s six
__label__False yeah so probably we ll have to use like long f long frame mmhmm
__label__False it s more money
__label__False yeah
__label__False well hopefully it s fixable
__label__False oh ok sorry
__label__False ok
__label__False and for for connected digit over the telephone you do nt actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation because somebody get on the phone and say a number and then you just want it
__label__True well we might uh we might have to experiment with uh better training set again but i the other thing is i mean before you found that wa the best configuration but you might have to retest those thing now that we have different
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep
__label__False oh
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False r correlation
__label__False uh i mean for me i would actually want to have some piece of paper that had the transcription and i would sort of flip through it
__label__False by th by the way this is totally unfair you may you may feel but the the uh the morning meeting folk actually have an an extra month or so
__label__False i mean that s what you started with
__label__False anyway there it is
__label__False sri to actually u u p th uh build support linux a a platform so
__label__False or just
__label__False so it we just and we use that actually in hubfive to do the scoring
__label__False the there is one i do nt know if this us it
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False r
__label__False but
__label__False no
__label__False he had the the long form
__label__False so
__label__False oh god
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok uuh
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False octave is the um unix clone of of matlab which you can batch
__label__False and and uh i got the impression from your mail that in fact there wa enough thing like this just in the little sample that that you looked at that that it s plausible at least
__label__False yeah
__label__False and but y is what y of the spectrum or
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah e exactly um you know this of course doe not make sense in light of the statue of liberty however it is uh you know sort of these sort of thing are imaginable
__label__False those are the bottom thing are input also
__label__False but
__label__False ok
__label__False that would be good
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False so here s this other system which is a lot better but there s still this kind of ratio it s something like five percent error with the the distant mike and one percent with the close mike
__label__False why is the landmark
__label__False the shape file is if you think about a wavefile sixteen thousand sample per second is way too many to display on the screen
__label__False pfft
__label__False yeah
__label__False right i understand that i just meant that so you have three choice there s um
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh and
__label__False um and the test data is callhome and switchboard
__label__False uh so maybe we c we can take a look at that
__label__False right so the oth the other thing that so f i
__label__False good
__label__False yeah
__label__False and once you the other thing is that once you represent start representing more and more context it is uh much more um specific to a particular task in language
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but um if there s noise then the very signal that it s looking at is corrupted so that it s decision about what the right you know right right uh delay are is uh is right delayed signal is is is uh is incorrect
__label__False plus n
__label__False um so what we ve been using so far wa sort of a simplified version of the scoring
__label__False ok
__label__False should we do digit first
__label__False and our system wa fortynine but with the neural network
__label__False yeah no problem
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False for what
__label__False well
__label__False nnn
__label__False and and you indicated to me that we have a g a goal now for the for the um the uh darpa demo of twenty hour
__label__False it s even it uh hurt even so
__label__False a opposed to the rest of u
__label__False right so that s different
__label__False and uh so so the overall result is like in the last page which is like fortyseven which is still very imbalanced because there are like fiftysix percent on the speechdatcar and thirtyfive percent on the tidigits
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm yeah
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False actually maybe i one one relate more related thing in transcription so that s the ibm stuff we ve got that sorted out
__label__False he i
__label__False right
__label__True yeah to n no to just get the dem get the demo they need
__label__False right when the person said this the car is there it s raining and this is happening
__label__False um
__label__False so i think
__label__False right
__label__False yeah no
__label__False thank you andreas
__label__False and nnn nnn
__label__False um well we have lot of them
__label__False yeah
__label__False right i m j well you can do experiment but the it s cheating relative to what we call a system where we can completely control this black box and it s not a very smart system it it only know what we give it
__label__False if there are thing that you know are intentionspecific then we should put them up somewhere a
__label__False you need some of the word in there so that you can say well this segment match this one this segment match this one and this one doe nt match at all unless we insert a beep
__label__False uh and we focused for the the test part on the english and the italian
__label__False so although i i sort of know how to run it there are a little a f few detail here and there that i ll have to dig out
__label__False really
__label__False well so just take the inverse and you re fine
__label__False two two one one nine six seven eight three
__label__False so you re talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mapping of phone so you d use that data to give you sort of what the the true mapping are for each phone
__label__False because i i found a difference
__label__False agenda
__label__False th
__label__False and um uh we re making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything uh with with uh equal strength
__label__False and you get that for each class you get a zero or a one
__label__False so then the bayesnet that would merge there that would make the decision between gothere infoon and location would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted and based upon that node then you would look at the other stuff
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False sh sh well i could i m closer i could
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so everybody know what happened except me
__label__False f um
__label__False uh but yeah sunil in in your result it s
__label__False thanks
__label__False so that s a good question where doe it come from
__label__False into our our our cult
__label__False yeah
__label__False opening hour or something like that
__label__False no
__label__False let s see what happens if i maximize this
__label__False when they removed the silence frame did they insert some kind of a marker so that the recognizer know it s know when it s time to back trace or something
__label__False oh they
__label__False and that ll be something like
__label__False right yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False right
__label__False mmm
__label__False um so ib in mu for example in museum you know a a building or a something where picture hang versus you know ev something that put on exhibit so forth but
__label__False so let s
__label__False and so then we would just stop it
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think the issue is to focus on on uh improving the the net
__label__False yeah i do nt know
__label__False well at least the uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False well uh i guess the work that s been done on segmentation would be most yeah
__label__False ok fine
__label__False uh i do nt know probably we should nt probably we should nt talk about funding stuff
__label__False i ll talk to you more about it later is that is that there s there s uh the radio station and television station already have stuff worked out presumably uh related to you know legal issue and and permission and all that i mean they already do what they do do whatever they do so it s uh it s so it s so it s another source so i think it s something we should look into you know we ll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at uw also and um and maybe we have this other source but yeah i think that it s not unreasonable to aim at getting you know significantly in excess of a hundred hour i mean that wa sort of our goal
__label__False metonymy and metaphor here right
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False the other thing that i just thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you re supposed to meet your friend there or som you know so you like being able to infer the second thing is very useful and probably often right but having them separate
__label__False i mean i thought it wa all fine and then i ran it and i got something worse than not using it
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well that ll be interesting so uh
__label__False yeah normally context will include a huge amount of information but um we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they re a tourist or not i guess
__label__False well i i i
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False i see
__label__False um
__label__False you know the one we would nt constrain to be next to the other word
__label__False right
__label__False and and just like it gave me the baseline performance of the aurora which is like zero improvement
__label__True in principle what i i think that this approach doe and e e whether or not we take the enterview and we all throw up up the ladder um wha how do how doe professor peter call that the uh hhh silence su sublimination
__label__False so we do nt have start and end point at each point where there s an overlap we just have the the overlap encoded in a simple bin
__label__False syste
__label__False ok
__label__False tran
__label__False and it s because you know that that person actually is following you know
__label__False five two nine eight eight eight four five five six two four
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ah
__label__False sorry at twenty five hertz since they re downsampling by two
__label__False and uh the place ha nice wall
__label__False no satly the me the mel cepstrum the new base system the new base system
__label__False yeah if you do nt have one more than one mike you do nt have a very good handle on location
__label__False no i mean that there s no point in going through all of that if that s the bottom line really so i i think we have to start
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False nine excuse me nine five with wireless and four without and four with wired
__label__False yeah i mean i know that um people doing some robustness thing a way back were were just doing just being gross and just throwing in the fft and actually it wa nt wa nt wa nt so bad
__label__False doodoop doodoo
__label__False yeah
__label__False and best is to smooth this somehow
__label__False well let s why do nt we talk about microphone issue that wa that wa a
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False you see how clumsy this is right i have to use these battery to bias them
__label__False to be best f
__label__False the question is um whether it would be helpful i particularly if you used if you had more
__label__False to overrule yeah
__label__True um i heard from uw that they re they re uh very close to getting their uh setup purchased they re they re they re buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf
__label__False then again everything else is free then once you re in in there
__label__False o five one zero one two four one five two nine zero four six seven eight three six
__label__False they are w now building it
__label__False mapping meeting or
__label__False that s not about that is it
__label__False right
__label__False alright
__label__False and
__label__False so there is there s gon na be a bunch of statue
__label__False yeah
__label__False it w it doe nt have like street on it that would allow them to figure out their way ok
__label__False because when abbott s yeah right because when abbott is down you ca nt work
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s that s an interesting point whether you re
__label__False i mean in these case if you go from the the uh i mean i do nt remember the number right off but if you if you go from the wellmatched case to the medium it s not an enormous difference in the in the the trainingtesting situation and and and it s a really big performance drop you know so um
__label__False oh no no i m not i m not planning to do any any phoneme mapping yet just it s it s basically it s it s really simple basically a detection of phonological feature
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean there are lot of way of doing it but w but if we ca nt figure out a remote way of doing it just letting them log in to icsi might be ok
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False how d you cut it
__label__False well this is one of thing we were arguing about
__label__False and also s you know sue s preference a well
__label__False do you wan na try
__label__False i mean wh
__label__False this is this that one s better mmhmm
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False and in each case ho um i m sorry in each case how do you determine you know the the usual fudge factor the uh the uh language uh scaling acoustic scaling uh uh
__label__False like it s a conjunction of i do nt know you know the verb used and some other stuff that that would determine yeah exactly
__label__False but you could imagine that three people talking ha a different spectral characteristic than two so
__label__False are you sure
__label__False and what s the top frequency of each
__label__False i do nt see your point what what what i am thinking or what we re about to propose here is we re always gon na get the whole list of value and their posterior probability
__label__False so we re ok for for a couple week then
__label__False anyway i i d it d be neat to have that because you know we ve been at this for a little while and we do nt have have any result yet with with conversational speech at a distance
__label__False um
__label__False hmm
__label__False no no the top y is what
__label__False what sort of what sort of feature are you looking at
__label__True over a cappuccino tomorrow
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i know i am i m serious they re just super
__label__True what is octave so
__label__False well d yeah this is making the assumption
__label__False that d be good we we ll give everybody the same sheet but they say different
__label__False given this input we also in some situation may wan na postulate an opinion whether that person want to go there now the nicest way use a cab or so s want to know it want to know where it is because he want something fixed there because he want to visit t it or whatever
__label__False um
__label__False but um in term of specifying the scenario um uh uh we ve gotten a little further but um we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard and have the wizard partake in the ultimate sort of definition probe
__label__False no
__label__False oh you never have oh it s a treat
__label__False sorry fifteen
__label__False uh adaptation nonadaptation um factor of two um
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean you re almost done
__label__False i m ho
__label__False well it s ok it s only the first try i what i m thinking is um obviously we can do the we can we can choose any sixteen bit from the twenty four so we can just have different gain thing that we use you know per channel
__label__False it s it s spatial reference frame you actually have only
__label__False mmm
__label__False s s h
__label__False yes yes i ve i ve i ve i guess i m on record for promising that now so um
__label__False i guess it depends on jane s uh you know if that s if that model work for the transcript then that s fine but if that pr um allows someone to come in and modify while you re modifying and they turn out to be change that you know would have been better to wait until your version came out then that s really up to you not up to the software so
__label__False oh
__label__False and th the
__label__False right
__label__False i do nt see how you get the second expression from the top one
__label__False one uh
__label__False oh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh my gosh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False they are not transcribed yet so yeah
__label__False yeah i know there is an i wa looking on the we web page and he s updated it for an xml version of i guess bayesnets there s a bayesnet spec for in xml
__label__False i do nt know what the word is a a bit of a rough way um it sounded like he um he he it it wa nt really fleshed out and maybe he did something that wa interesting for the test situation but i i m not sure if it s what i d wan na use so i have to i have to read it more i do nt really understand what he s doing yet
__label__False ok
__label__False and um you know th
__label__False it happened to c be what it stand for
__label__False i sent out yet another this morning which i think make six total email that i ve sent to these people and so i think we need to escalate to some other method of trying to contact them
__label__False no
__label__False and also there are like funny noise on finnish more than on italian i mean like music and um
__label__True i think tha i think the the meeting is on the thirteenth or something
__label__False um but whenever you smooth you lose something so the question is have you lost something you can you use
__label__False do
__label__False uh w i
__label__False um if beep were like the segment that we get from um the transcription tool already that that s what we have done and it work very well you can see these segment align and these do nt
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False and that s like just to f n get a feel of how good it is
__label__False yeah i can s
__label__False hardly anything so not even in description w did we find anything um relevant
__label__False i wa noticing that with dan in the one that we uh we hand tran handsegmented that th he ha these little chuckle a he talk
__label__False it
__label__True actually i may not be here either so i got ta double check the date but anyway
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False o
__label__False i m sick of being the one to sort of go through and say well what do you think about this
__label__False s what do ca structure from the from the lisp
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False is that alright
__label__False so training and test noise are different
__label__False mmm
__label__False uh but mayb maybe then it should be done in the old original way w instead of channelizing and having the uh uh you know elaborate coding of the backchannels
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False absolute
__label__False you know i just realized something which is of e th this question about the uh the possible mismatch of
__label__False larry saul s work um just reading reading how how we can take that a a frontend cuz it it detects these feature and they plug it into um backend so i ve been looking at a lot of um backend stuff people have been doing articulatory feature and seeing seeing what i can what i can pull off the shelf and plug into um larry saul s work
__label__False ami might be here and it s possible that nancy ll be here
__label__False yeah
__label__False and give them more money they just want a fun place for them to to work
__label__False yeah
__label__False excuse me
__label__False just just reboot it
__label__False these are all so all of these seventythree feature are going into um the uh the hmm
__label__False yeah we meant uh touristic reason
__label__True it s kleist it s the uh bielefeld generation of uh spatial description and whatever
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that that card that machine s got sound they ve got a sound blaster built into it
__label__False cuz you re like it s a state of there s resource right and like what is film the state you know you re out of the state of having film right and somehow film is standing for the re the resour the state of having some resource is just labeled a that resource
__label__False so um
__label__False well i do nt think it s that much harder than paper
__label__False sometimes the change are um case where the recognizer would get it wrong anyway cuz it wa some word that we did nt have in the vocabulary or
__label__False so there s a question of whether you would
__label__False ok
__label__False eee
__label__False no you should nt
__label__False and uh i have some web page on t more of the background
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um i mean we have the party line ha been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation because people move around and uh if if it s if it s uh not a simple echo like a crosstalk kind of echo but it s actually room acoustic it s it s it s you ca nt really do inversion and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something it may you
__label__False you get out switchboard that s just the lang the language model
__label__False i could swore uh i could swear i saw it sitting on someone s desk at some point but is there a um a transcript of any of the sort of initial interaction of people with the with the system
__label__False oh i thought you meant this wa just the digit section i did nt know you meant it wa aurora digit
__label__False well i i wa
__label__False yeah
__label__False and never change throughout anything else
__label__False then maybe it would be ok
__label__False not because it would expedite the probability cuz it would nt
__label__False yeah at some point you also might wan na take the same thing and try it on uh some broadcast news data or something else that actually ha ha some noisy noisy component so we can see if any conclusion we come to hold across different data
__label__False oh kind of low variance would nt that be you sort of might end up with some infinity there but
__label__False you had to start somewhere
__label__False ok
__label__False it s just alt tab
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh
__label__False we could
__label__False we already actually do nt have a huge amount of training data um
__label__False well but
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False ok
__label__False th that part s definitely gon na confuse somebody who look at these later i mean this is we we re recording secret nsa meeting i mean it s
__label__False verb used is actually personally amusing mainly because it s it s just whether the verb is a tango verb an enter verb or a vista verb
__label__False indifferent
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh oh
__label__False uh so it would s and and you know that i it s got ta hurt you a little bit to not have a a spectral uh a s a smooth spectral envelope so there must be something else that you get in return for that that uh uh
__label__False and uh and sixtytwo with the the you know quote unquote cheating vad and fiftyseven is what you got with the real vad
__label__False you know i assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output
__label__False eight one nine
__label__False o zero zero two one o three two nine six o six eight four three zero zero five six six five zero eight seven nine zero six three eight nine zero two two five zero one five one five two five three five three four five o six
__label__False yeah
__label__False we just want to show i mean it everybody belief it but you know we just
__label__False they seem to have a lot of accident on the amtrak
__label__False that that you know that would g help in term of encoding of overlap the the transcriber would have le uh disentangling to do if that were available
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah maybe
__label__False i have some
__label__False but certainly i would nt want a printout these are big and i would much rather be ha be able to just sit and leaf through it
__label__False transcript one one five one one one seven o seven three eight six eight nine three six
__label__False right
__label__False so we ll do that
__label__False so it s
__label__False hidden and two output
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False shoot
__label__False well i do nt know it overall
__label__False yeah
__label__False but
__label__False i think it s doe nt seem like it s quite the same cuz of this cuz then whatever that alignment is it s that for all all band well no that s not quite right we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did
__label__False percent
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False he said that
__label__False i noticed just glancing at the uh hopkins workshop uh web site that uh um one of the thing i do nt know well we ll see how much they accomplish but one of the thing that they were trying to do in the graphical model thing wa to put together a a uh tool kit for doing uh r um arbitrary graphical model for uh speech recognition
__label__False ok
__label__False zero eight eight seven six two two two zero nine five six
__label__False ok that s interesting ok well i wanted to raise the issue and um
__label__False and there i
__label__False and so it wa we had a couple paper like towards increasing the error rate in speech and and so on
__label__False in in
__label__False new wireless
__label__False uh no but what it doe is it actually assembles all the user interface component then
__label__False you know
__label__False oh well whatever
__label__False so we wanted just to collect data to get that that that elicits more uh that elicits richer language
__label__False yeah
__label__False but it doe nt have to be root it could be some other user that we all can sux to
__label__False well mi for making thing better yeah but this for making thing worse this it migh th the thought is is is possible another possible partial cause is if the boot model used a comple used a different feature set that
__label__False mmm
__label__False and so if you make it too hard for them to check back in they ll check it out once they ll make all the change they ll never tell u about the change and we ll get two different corpus
__label__False yeah but is is if
__label__False like the someone s
__label__False o one five o two zero five eight four uh one six two eight five eight three two three three o three one five four five zero nine nine seven one one two eight four zero zero nine four
__label__False right if we have microphone in a pda it s gon na need bias and a preamp
__label__False and i have now uh sixtyfour
__label__False that s the right answer
__label__False so m what my intention to do is that a the transcript become ready um i would take them and generate the web page and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted and just uh tell them here s the web page um you need a password so th th question number one is how do we distribute the password and question number two is how else do we wan na provide this information if they want it
__label__False you know so so uh um
__label__False no no you re missing the point
__label__False so one thing that i did notice yesterday i wa studying the um the uh rasta code and it look like we do nt have any way to um control the frequency range that we use in our analysis we basically it look to me like we do the fft um and then we just take all the bin and we use everything
__label__True so people have been thinking about an alternative time and the one we came up with is friday twothirty three what wa it
__label__False great
__label__False oh is he oh ok
__label__False so many way that error prone
__label__False actually there is the difference in that so for the plp feature we use the triangular filter shape and for the in the sri frontend we use the trapezoidal one
__label__False one four three one seven seven one o three two
__label__False that s what we do with doctorspeech though right
__label__False what i mean is get it from the closetalking mike
__label__False that s good
__label__False hmm
__label__False oh right
__label__False you saying nw archive
__label__False two one five four eight five six two five six
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False i i i d i i do nt want to try to say cuz i
__label__False yes right
__label__False yeah
__label__False so i mean looking at different statistical measure of that difference coming up with some thing and just trying them out and seeing if you add them onto the feature vector doe that make thing better or worse in noise where you re really just i i the way i m looking at it is not so much you re trying to f find the best the world s best voicedunvoiced uh uh classifier but it s more that you know uh uh try some different statistical characterization of that difference back to the raw data and and m maybe there s something there that the system can use
__label__False it s
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False september
__label__False yeah so i mean pretty much anytime we need a disk we can get it at the rate that we re
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok ok gotcha
__label__False see
__label__False hmm
__label__False to go in that s like
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok ok alright
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False but uh yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False can i see that
__label__False so
__label__True yeah and i think hhh i m trying to remember but i think i recall that andreas wa saying that he wa gon na run sort of the reverse experiment
__label__False the pruning probably prune everything out
__label__False ok
__label__False some of them are completely absurd too like they want to enter but it s closed it s night time you know there are tourist and all this weird stuff happens at the line up and you re like confused
__label__False yeah so
__label__False ok audio monitoring jane
__label__False it might make the transcript faster w wel i mean i a quick conversation with brian would be good so
__label__False webbased
__label__False there s a threshold and yeah yeah so that that s uh
__label__True is brian kingsbury s work related to that or is it a different type of reverberation
__label__False mmm yeah mmm
__label__False it s the
__label__False right
__label__False uh
__label__False six two three nine zero six four three three nine
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False it s a tourist information web site so
__label__False that piece wa then uh sent to ibm so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point
__label__False and then if they say that i have a potential problem with these thing then you you say ok well you might wan na hear this in context to s think if you need that you issue them a password i in the
__label__False um
__label__False six
__label__False right
__label__False for
__label__False uh and sunil is working on on trying to to check everything
__label__False well it s sort of ha a simple one right it s it s just it s just a is nt it just a gaussian for each
__label__False well could we
__label__False yeah
__label__False wait a minute i i m confused wha what do you mean
__label__False but still it s a question if you have some threshold somewhere in term of beam search or something or
__label__False i think with
__label__False uh the th the
__label__False and the downsampling must have been dan
__label__False i m starting over
__label__False uh
__label__False right
__label__False you mean ja eh eh javier program no javier di doe nt worked with uh a markov
__label__False oh so we can get rid of the uh
__label__True have uh folk from nist been in contact with you
__label__False yeah i
__label__False no no but
__label__False are we
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False but the good thing is this doe
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh i see no this doe nt use it
__label__False nine nine one seven zero six seven o two six
__label__False yeah
__label__False well
__label__False it sounded like they were roughly equal
__label__False the other thing is is nt tidigits isolated digit
__label__False then maybe i can understand
__label__False yeah yeah the distribution the distribution is is similar
__label__False metonymy polysemy
__label__False yep
__label__False p
__label__False i wanted to do something very similar to the proposal a a first first try
__label__False and is it a
__label__False yeah or some silence probability from the vad if you have
__label__False oh i see the d see uh specifically in our situation d and o are gon na be uh yeah sure so whatever
__label__False and we did it with the automatic segmentation and i do nt think we ne we did nt look at it in detail
__label__False um forgot it something
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s a block yeah
__label__False so first thing is would it be better if they were multiple net for some reason
__label__False well key file ha the extra attribute that if you notice that there are lot of spike on channel soandso it s useful a a repository for putting that there
__label__False i should be around
__label__False i mean doe th
__label__False excuse me
__label__False o two seven nine five one five zero eight two five four
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah the the problem of course is that it s you know in in this meeting it s three four five six seven eight it s nine transcript potentially
__label__False ok alright
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i assume but they re all doing communicator stuff
__label__False eight zero five six zero eight one eight
__label__False mmm
__label__False it s hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then and get the construction in their form and stuff
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s with the noisy yeah it s it s not the clean lda
__label__False right
__label__False because most of it is sil
__label__False yeah now timit s clear um and plp is clear but uh there are thing that are not so well known in or or have variant u u us like the number you can say nine two or you can say ninetytwo and uh
__label__False can there be combination of the dit
__label__False and all
__label__False yeah i m i m not quite sure what i m talking about i mean
__label__False there s a difference
__label__False it s like a like a greek like a greek choir you know like yeah
__label__False for aurora
__label__False very kind of you stop back and suddenly it go away and you have to kind of work again to recapture it but yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah so the median filtering is fixed
__label__False there s there y but you do nt necessarily have to distribute password is what i m saying
__label__False hmm
__label__False for for the italian part i mean the uh the um network are trained with noise from aurora ti digit mmm
__label__False i see
__label__False yep
__label__False wa it with susan ervintripp
__label__False i mean were this a professional audio recording what we would do what you would do is in testing it is you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that thing are not giving that kind of performance
__label__False um people are le consistent about going to icassp and i think it s still it s still a reasonable forum for student to to present thing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so i wa just i just trying to understand that so if we call a factor of w just one just normalized to one the word error rate that you have for using tidigits a a training and tidigits a test uh different word i m sure but but uh uh the same task and so on
__label__False well we can put that
__label__False and uh
__label__False well you can run into in that sense too
__label__False yeah all is the the session
__label__False seven five four four two four two eight four seven
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well sure it is but
__label__False um and so i do think we re gon na continue recording here and record what we can
__label__False oh
__label__False uh yeah but it s a good thing anyway to have shorter delay
__label__False i always have to check every time y i send you an email a past email of yours to make sure i m spelling your name correctly
__label__False and then
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False nine two nine zero three one one four eight six two nine
__label__False so what i what about um i u what i w i mean i do nt know if this is a good idea or not but what if you put ran the other kind of lda uh on your feature right before they go into the hmm
__label__False you could clarify something for me you re saying point three percent you take a point three percent hit when the training and testing link are do nt match or something is that what it is or
__label__False i i actually have to run this stuff
__label__False display the feature
__label__False my first approach failed
__label__False no i m saying that s what people u typically use
__label__False like i said i m sure i m just hitting everything with a hammer that i developed but i mean you know uh it s
__label__False always need more for
__label__False like you m might be able to vista it right and be able to
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah we can yeah like do do uh one for each ca one for each person in the meeting you can only hire people who have perfect pitch and they can say aflat b
__label__False yes
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah well we re still like writing the script for doing the research and we will yes we re gon na try
__label__False so i mean it s good news it s not a good a it could have been but it wa uh
__label__False right the week after th th
__label__False yep
__label__False that seems to be the key issue
__label__False i think we trained the neural network on with embedded training so reestimation of the alignment using the neural network i guess
__label__False do you how much of that do you think is due to just the particular implementation and how much you re adjusting it or how much do you think is intrinsic to
__label__False yeah so i wa doing that first before i did these other thing just to make sure there wa nt something
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False but they are also on the network so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh amsterdam i think yeah yeah
__label__False and you ought to be able to shove tw uh sh uh pull off twenty millisecond from somewhere else to get it under two hundred right i mean
__label__False different than what
__label__False would w would it be possi there are script that uh run and and when it s finished compressing would it be possible for the script to change the permission on the file to be more strict
__label__False the wa wa nt there supposed to be a link in the
__label__False mmm
__label__False i mean once once you have this sort of a running a a module
__label__False s it seems like i if i m right in that it seems like you re setting it up for the most infrequent case rather than for the most frequent case
__label__False you have two net or three net wa this
__label__False that wa that wa before i tried it on the female
__label__False yeah
__label__False um so uh what we basically did so far wa using the mixed file to to detect s speech or nonspeech portion in that
__label__False six six two eight three six five one five zero
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah but the other thing i wa thinking wa um
__label__False i think um we will have all of our point in writing pretty soon so this is nice about being being recorded also the um
__label__False spent my youth practicing the tango de la muerte
__label__False um so it s not a meeting right because it s two people and they re not face to face
__label__False maybe it s the bell gram
__label__False want to do vista right because if you want to view thing you would nt be in a hurry
__label__False well you can come up with new construction
__label__False and and then this noise cancellation would get
__label__False no
__label__False it s g it
__label__False yeah
__label__False how are you doing the uh acronym so if i say pzm what would it appear on the transcript
__label__False ah
__label__False so you could ve had a repeat count in there or something
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False what i m saying is that it can be the case that people can do it themselves and it can be reviewed
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok and um fey is with u a of six day ago officially officially but in reality already um much much longer and um um next to some some more or le bureaucratic uh stuff with the the data collection she s also the wizard in the data collection
__label__False this sound like a paper i ve read around here recently in term of
__label__False and i if there s sort of a clear winner here and um and this is pretty uh
__label__False i see
__label__False ok
__label__False italian digit i got a number of state ranging on the low end from nine to the high end eighteen
__label__False right
__label__False not unless you really want to
__label__False you you you guy plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same thing we ve been talking about for aurora and
__label__False yeah have you guy seen the display have you guy seen either of the demo they re pretty cool like the prosody demo we basically w loaded up um word alignment so instead of having um utterance in the bottom it s like just word by word
__label__False so my guess uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but if you say we did a n cheating experiment which is really the standard way you d say it it say you deliberately put in a piece of me information that you would not have in the real world so that you can learn something
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and we have
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah go ahead
__label__False like it s
__label__False and so that that s a minor part of it i just wanted some web interface so that people you did nt actually have to send everyone the text
__label__False so that s gon na be
__label__False look like it
__label__False with the f with the neural net yeah and r and
__label__False five none f five nine one six zero four zero zero
__label__False you know do you do a supervised adaptation
__label__False i mean shastri would say you know binding is like an essential cognitive uh process so um
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok you can keep it
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so do you think his interest is in using this a a data source or training material or what
__label__False o eight six seven nine three four four three five seven two
__label__False i mean i it s possible that the
__label__False yeah
__label__True the day after tomorrow wednesday
__label__False to get the speech voice activity detection or else just using the silence if there s only one silence output
__label__False right ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False only
__label__False ok so basically you re creating a signaltonoise ratio of twentyfive or thirty db uh r
__label__False so i had done some experiment where i wa i i want to play with the number of mixture but um uh i wanted to first test to see if we actually need to do this many iteration early on and so um i i ran a couple of experiment where i reduced that to l to be three two two uh five i think and i got almost the exact same result
__label__False transcript three five three one dash three five five zero nine zero zero one one nine one four seven o o two two six three four five one eight three nine five five six seven nine two five three
__label__False and then anyway we would have to reduce this with the klt so but i do nt know
__label__False audio
__label__False you have to sort of um jose if you have nt done this you have to plug your ear while you re t talking so that you do nt get confused i guess
__label__False it s on biocomputation would
__label__False well th you can either you ca or you can read both
__label__False mmm not direct
__label__False or i
__label__False yeah
__label__False do y
__label__False yeah it s machine machine experiment um i mean w when when the uh the neural net w uh wave hit in the mideighties and by the late eighty there were uh we were reviewing thousand of paper that were coming out in neural net it wa really hot everybody thought it would do everything
__label__False what
__label__False and then i took this system and mmm w uh i p we put the old filter also
__label__False oh that s
__label__False i have to to finish transcribing
__label__False uh i think you know the main reason for having
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False ok
__label__False ok wh wh yeah ok some in some introduction are in order
__label__False right
__label__False ok thanks bye bye
__label__False it s just uh that i it he ha the twopass issue that
__label__False it seems the performance seems worse in finnish which uh
__label__False so i m i m not following this perfectly but um i
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False right
__label__False probably we could we could probably just run shorten on them or something and it will get a big win
__label__False we u
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False right um to come up with a mapping from um mfcc s or s some feature set um to uh w to whether there s existence of a particular phonological feature
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False that s because we re talking about landmark a touristic landmark not a possible um navigational landmark so
__label__False well you know i i do think eating while you re doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise but i had another question which is um you know in principle w um i know that you do nt want artificial topic but um it doe seem to me that we might be able to get subject from campus to come down and do something that would nt be too artificial i mean we could political discussion or or something or other and i you know people who are because you know there s also this constraint we d it s like you know the the uh goldibears goldi goldilocks it s like you do nt want meeting that are too large but you do nt want meeting that are too small and um a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool in the positive sense of the word
__label__False yeah i mean i know you do nt have a lot of data to estimate with but but uh um
__label__False um
__label__False so is it is it though the performance big relation in the high ma high mismatch ha something to do with the uh cleaning up that you that is done on the timit after adding noise so it s i all the noise are from the tidigits right
__label__False mmm
__label__False that and the correlation between stuff
__label__False but it if
__label__False but that s pretty uncommon
__label__False ok
__label__False well
__label__False and i and i think a crucial part of that is the idea of of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero backup so that there wo nt be huge number of of added uh
__label__False um but um well we still have to see how it all come out
__label__False uhhuh right
__label__False um but uh that s th but we have data in english and german already so transcribed i will send you that
__label__False yeah well what i think you know would be more what you d want to do is is is uh put it into another neural net
__label__False voiced
__label__False wa it that many i just do nt recall
__label__False that s not clear but this e
__label__False right
__label__False delegate
__label__False so i i just want it to be worded in such a way where it give the strong impre it give very i mean nothing hidden v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data
__label__False yeah
__label__True but it involves rewiring and so if i could borrow someone tomorrow afternoon to help my brain you know just have someone to bounce the instruction off of and make sure i do nt do anything too stupid
__label__False who s the second jeff
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah maybe not
__label__False oh yes of course like there s the
__label__False but then yeah the lda i uh is interesting because it would sort of say well suppose you actually trained this up to do the best you could by some criterion what would the filter look like then
__label__False hmm
__label__False it seems pretty
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh that d be so super they would be so s so terrific
__label__False um i think
__label__False so this is not so bad and then when we jump to the multilingual data it s uh it become worse and well
__label__False hmm
__label__False and what you say is the is the re uh o other side of this which is that you know so th there are lot of channel where you do nt have these backchannels w when a question ha been asked and and these
__label__True we ll meet next tuesday i guess
__label__False yeah
__label__False o one o seven zero three one five o three six two eight o o three four five zero two zero zero seven two o three three one seven eight nine five one two two zero nine eight five three
__label__False yeah well just i mean just in that that one s ten second or whatever it wa example that adam had that that we we passed on to others a few month ago there wa that business where i g i guess it wa adam and jane were talking at the same time and and uh in the closetalking mike you could nt hear the overlap and in the distant mike you could so yeah it s clear that if you wan na study if you wan na find all the place where there were overlap it s probably better to use a distant mike on the other hand there s other phenomenon that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the closetalking mike so it s
__label__False so
__label__True yeah just doing a digit on it uh connected digit
__label__False that seventyfive point seven nine in the finnish mismatch which is that the eleven point nine six what we see
__label__False what kind of number wa he getting with that
__label__False twentyfive and then they have to transcribe what that number is each time
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i could say something about about the well i do nt know what you wan na do yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and we put the data actually on nonbackedup disk
__label__False yeah
__label__False so that d be good from for analysis it s good to have some uh case of the same utterance at different different time yeah
__label__False cuz it would really be
__label__False are the mean pretty different for the two
__label__False it s not like german train
__label__False he added a bit on i guess because before we were we were had were able to have the noise uh stuff uh and the lva be in parallel and now he s he s requiring it to be done first
__label__False right h
__label__False that s increase e
__label__False i have a quick question about microphone um
__label__False yep
__label__False if you use the combination of the closetalking mike you would hear jane interrupting me but you would nt hear the paper rustling
__label__False not yet
__label__False i
__label__False per utterance ok
__label__False i ve heard burst also
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False anyth any other uh repo visit report sort of story
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh leave it on uh and the
__label__False um
__label__False uh still not yeah
__label__False uh yes i do actually let me see
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok is trying to get the formalism into into a shape where it can actually uh d
__label__False hmm
__label__False the hundred milla mill a hundred millisecond for smoothing is sort of an arbitrary amount it could be eighty and and probably do
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep
__label__False uh i i will
__label__False six seven three zero zero zero five nine six
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but
__label__False and that wa just convenience for my sake that it s uh uh it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcript if we would do it at the subutterance level
__label__False zero four eight nine four three two three one
__label__False um and crash
__label__False yes we could thing we could nt extract the from the data the hidden variable yes good
__label__False or doe he want to go there
__label__False because i m gon na switch to the javabayes program and then if i do that it ll mess everything up
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False but a soon a we added lda online normalization and all these thing then
__label__False oh ok
__label__False it s actually an arbitrary arbitrary regular expression but if you search your name you ll get all of the thing you said and any time anyone said your name so
__label__False oh i m sorry you re talking about that a a possible thing to plug into the sonys no
__label__False one of u
__label__False which mean you know even just splitting it up into a few file would probably take you know nearly all the time there would be no
__label__False um
__label__False it seems like it s equivalent to say that it doe nt have a door a and it
__label__False so we ha
__label__False some
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh throwing away the first
__label__False you could do this you know you could
__label__False so what what
__label__False voc for vocalized like cough or like laugh or whatever
__label__False um i mean i wa thinking of then i and then i realized well the recognizer will just go along and line up all the beep and then there ll be all the extra beep at the end if there were more beep then you wanted
__label__False i do nt quite understand how that how that work if
__label__False well that s the rea w w what i m arguing is thats
__label__False mmhmm but that s from run yeah
__label__False and so the version he s sending u is already producing the english that s needed to get by in version one point one
__label__False yeah
__label__False of that i mean the snr after the noise compensation of the speechdatcar
__label__False ok i can get the address or if you know where you are i can tell you how to get there
__label__False it s good
__label__False we used uh timit and we used canonical mapping between the phone and th yeah
__label__False in other word if you d
__label__False right
__label__True that they ll be here so it s it s extremely important that the two of you are also present in this town during that time
__label__False the second test is trained on a single language um with broad database but the same language a the t task data
__label__False i m missing one figure here
__label__True so what s the advantage of support vector machine what
__label__False no but that s what the pr well that s what i m saying you can line them up based on the time
__label__False right that s the same software i used to get the data
__label__False there is a l a there is a lot of uh there are a lot of utterance with music in with music in the background
__label__False i see ok
__label__False oh sorry
__label__False that too but
__label__False i just wanted to understand it cuz i
__label__False yeah so we have nt uh managed like we do nt have node for discourse and parse although like in some sense they are part of this beliefnet but uh
__label__False yeah right uh that s right that s right um
__label__False well yeah b yeah i would say time bin so my my goal is to get word with reference to a time bin beginning and end point and and sometimes you know it wa like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle but yeah w it just wa nt important for our purpose to have it that i disrupt that unit in order to have you know a the word in the order in which they were spoken it would have it would have been hard with the interface that we have now my a adam s working on a of course on a revised overlapping interface but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and and if we and if someone say you know uh something in mandarin to the system wed would nt know which node to look at to answer that question right
__label__False yeah right
__label__False so training is done on different condition and different microphone and testing also is done on different microphone and condition
__label__False um and so it might matter how fast someone wa talking for instance
__label__False yeah but that s our decision then right
__label__False you wait to the point when you re ready to release it and then you put it in the repository and if other people wan na
__label__False oh
__label__False now it s correct
__label__False um it look up some stuff that you know is is that is in the written by the operating system only if it if you get a dhcp request so it you know my computer doe not know it ip address you know
__label__False ha
__label__False so it th these are all possibility
__label__False i mean the only thing i m worried about with that approach is that if we need to figure out the beep alignment problem before the transcriber do the correction here then we re in trouble in other word if the transcript are nt sort of good enough that the aligner constraint are good enough to sort of show you where the error are then it would nt work but it might work it might work to do this if their transcript are pretty close on the word that usually get recognized correctly which are the you know function word the common word
__label__False maybe
__label__False hmm
__label__False and um the weight yeah the target for the training of the and anded thing is something that s kept uh a a hidden variable and is learned with em
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False oh ok
__label__False oh ok i see
__label__False i mean ev eventually we ll want to like tape that over and run them up through the center so that wire are nt are nt people are nt tripping over the wire and so on
__label__False yeah
__label__False we re pausing for a photo opportunity here uh
__label__False is eh a another acoustic event
__label__False a a a couple percent or some i mean
__label__False yeah
__label__False and then you merge everything in term of you know linearizing the sequence based on the time mark
__label__False this is this is really good
__label__False different
__label__False there wa another short one yeah and so i have nt grabbed the latest one that he just uh put out yet
__label__False well um just a an example for you know the future of the fact that maybe people will wear those microphone or some people might to meeting you know
__label__False yep
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i do nt know how much of a chance you had to actually read it because but you could always send me comment per electronic mail and they will be incorporated
__label__False that s a good way to end a meeting
__label__False yes more of an attempt to i mean apparently it wa very clear to her that these the a this this wa a sound these are the sound but
__label__False what if we just give it a a name like we give these meeting a name
__label__False right a an institution yeah
__label__False well but that s not
__label__False no
__label__False right
__label__False i ok i have to ask you something which is first of all um is i doe it have to be wave because if we could benefit from what you did incorporate that into the present transcript that would help
__label__False yeah just the static no delta
__label__False great
__label__False yep
__label__False and because we re sticking to that structure the synthesis module doe nt need to be changed so all that f fancy stuff and the texas speech version of it which is actually the simpler version is gon na be done in october which is much too late for u so
__label__False well with just one digit though
__label__False alright
__label__False but whatever they did i mean they have to play within the rule of this specific evaluation
__label__False i wanted to get a feel for that to sort of be able to know what what can be done first and like how many meeting are we recording and
__label__False just so you know but anyway
__label__False wrong yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok so so then if so so then let s right
__label__False so you have w w one sheet
__label__False you do ok
__label__False well i know there were some speaker labeling problem um after interruption is that what you re referring to
__label__False th they were suggesting going to markov model uh but in addition there s an expansion of what javier did and one of those thing looking at the statistical component even if the feature that you give it are maybe not ideal for it it s just sort of this general filter bank or or cepstrum or something um
__label__False uh
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i do nt know i i j uh uh pr
__label__False so i think it on on each block it ll it ll compress you know if there s load on in any range it ll use ratio bit i think it doe that
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False right right
__label__False and then you pick pick a movie and and and it show show you the time and you pick a time and you pick seat and all of this so
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False well maybe somebody ll think of something but this is uh
__label__False ok
__label__False ok
__label__False three nine five five seven four three three six
__label__False this is sort of uh
__label__False oh
__label__False uh in other word it s not really a scoring script problem it s
__label__False oh they they have little headset or what do they
__label__False o two seven zero five one four two three o two four o three eight six two four seven four nine eight four one eight seven five o nine six zero
__label__False it s o k i
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but it s so this time we we are at an advantage because it wa a problem for the german system to incorporate all these english movie title
__label__False transcript six nine
__label__False transcript uh ok ok
__label__False ok
__label__False i would nt think that the language model would continue across two second
__label__False yeah and all that sort of stuff
__label__False how diligent do we feel yeah do feel that we have done our chore for this week or
__label__False but
__label__False um oh and also we actually have a few people who have still not filled out speaker form
__label__False be great
__label__False uh
__label__False ah
__label__True and we plan to work also on the idea of using both feature and net output
__label__False ok
__label__False and they ve been not so much looking at the cross task uh multiple language issue
__label__False yeah
__label__False then if someone uh want to review it uh and i know you do nt like this but i m offering this a a suggestion is that is that we then give them a print out
__label__False why twentyeight
__label__False but it ll it really increase what we can run on so together with the fact that we ve got these faster linux box and that it take le time to do these um we should be able to crank through a lot more experiment
__label__False yeah
__label__False is this just this little
__label__False so um
__label__False so w we will hafta worry about format
__label__False o
__label__False yeah do they have to be mutually exclusive
__label__False ok
__label__False but it s possible with my segmentation by hand that we have information about the the overlapping uh yeah
__label__False it s hardly ever used but it s w
__label__False yeah
__label__False um there wa actually a java backend that apparently is actually a little faster
__label__False and that sort of um is useful and t you know and then once in a while they ll have to refer to the other channel to clear something up
__label__False yep
__label__False same microphone but yeah
__label__False we can do a demo in the sense that we can um just ob observe the fact that this will in fact do inference so we can you know set some of the uh node and then try to find the probability of other node
__label__False i g i guess the question i had wa um amount of data e u wa the amount of data that you d give it to um update this estimate because say you if you have say five thousand utterance in your training set um and you you keep the mean from the last utterance by the time it get to the five thousandth utterance
__label__False ok
__label__False he on only train
__label__False and they do
__label__False but we are nt gon na ignore those cuz we re we re not only going the plan is not only to lay out this thing but to actually uh build some of it
__label__False so another way of looking at it is that um the mel cepstru mel spectrum mel cepstrum any of these variant um give you the smooth spectrum it s the spectral envelope
__label__False yeah i i know what i wa thinking wa that maybe uh i i we could actually t t try at least looking at uh some of the the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone at least from the good one
__label__False this so actually we yeah here the feature are noise compensated and there is also the lda filter
__label__False well also jane jane wa doing word level
__label__False i think probably something on the order of six
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False and if we continue to collect some next semester i think we should uh
__label__False and uh it s gon na make
__label__False well right i i just did ten per page i could easily do twenty per page
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i mean you you can get y i mean you get them pretty close
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i mean if if you can um if you wan na well jane and i were just in term of the tool talking about this i guess sue had had some reaction you know interfacewise if you re looking at speech you wan na be able to know really where the word are and so we can give you some example of sort of what this output look like um and see if you can in maybe incorporate it into the transcriber tool some way or
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh we have them now
__label__False mmm
__label__False so if uh if the uh high mismatch case had been more like the uh the other two case in term of giving you just a better performance how would this number have changed
__label__False well i wa just wondering if i i
__label__False so i think what we should probably do is any quick small stuff we can do every week
__label__False mmhmm that s very nice huh
__label__False and i do nt think there s anything in the legal aspect that that is hurt by our expressing that bias
__label__False i think
__label__False so it s bandlimited timit
__label__False o eight four one o five seven
__label__False ok alright i see
__label__False and
__label__False what you really want are these binary label and just a few of them
__label__False then they should send that through well
__label__False okay good
__label__False it s worse
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False hmm
__label__False no actually there s more training data
__label__False oops
__label__False even you have reported actually zero delay for the compression i thought maybe you also have some different
__label__False yeah
__label__False and i m surprised i sort of i m surprised i forgot that but uh i think that would be a good thing to add
__label__False uh the issue is whether people make a decision now based on what they ve already seen or they make it later and one of the argument for making it later is let s make sure that whatever technique that we re using work for something more than than connected digit
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well the only the only question about that that i have is um i think brian ha to put all this stuff onto a tape
__label__False uh there is smoothing of the gain trajectory with some kind of uh lowpass filter which ha forty millisecond latency
__label__False ok
__label__False let s all say it a few more time just kidding
__label__False so then you could use cv and you know just f have remote access but then it s up to whoever is sort of responsible for that level of transcription to decide how and when to put these lock or
__label__False if the segment change that wo nt work
__label__False yeah
__label__False doe nt that only change the scoring if a word ha moved into a different segment i mean i do nt think that s har i hardly ever see that i think most of them are pretty good
__label__False yeah
__label__False there s laughter um i m talking more about strong difference of opinion meeting maybe with manager type or
__label__False i mean it so the system so the vad wa trained on maybe different set of label for channel zero and channel one and wa the alignment were w were different for s certainly different because they were independently trained we did nt copy the channel zero alignment to channel one
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False i have nt talked to sunil i asked hynek whether they compared that to just taking the net we already had and summing up the probability
__label__False it is something that need to get done and i wan na also coordinate it with dave so that we do a level zero backup right after
__label__False doing something like um um phoneme within context and well basically context dependent phoneme
__label__False well or i dunno
__label__False why do you
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False and and uh the the msg feature were sort of built up with this notion but i guess i thought you had brought this up in the context of um target somehow
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False on the bus is a m is a metaphorical metonymy that relates some meta path metaphorically and you re on on that path and th w i mean it s he there s a platform notion right he s on the standing on the bus waving to me but th the regular a we speak j johno wa on the bus to new york um uh he s that s uh what did i call it here the transportation schema something where you can be on the first flight on the second flight and you can be you know on the wagon
__label__False so um everything that we did could probably just be added on to what alcatel did and i it d probably work pretty well with them too
__label__False do they meet every week or every
__label__False mmhmm mmhmm
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False anyway
__label__False and they re really excellent
__label__False so it could be that you know for the short word there s because you have so many state you just do nt have enough data to train all those gaussians
__label__False i dunno chuck do you have any any update
__label__False well i mean i uh just basically that maybe i said maybe we said this before just that we met and we talked about it and we sort of have a plan for getting thing organized and
__label__False and so you know that s part of what take so long to train the the the backend for this
__label__False cuz you got ta do something otherwise if it s just a bunch of speech stuck together
__label__False oh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so
__label__False but yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False could be yeah
__label__False could we capture that with a different construal of
__label__False right
__label__False uh
__label__False we re running a little short here we uh uh cou trying to eh wa p well you know the thing i m concerned about is we wanted to do these digit and and i have nt heard uh from jose yet so
__label__False yeah right
__label__False well at the at the tail end yeah he ha to know what s where it s sonorant
__label__False well that s actually what i had planned personally i had i i had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guy do a lot of work and i do nothing
__label__False do nt know but anyway it sound like a reasonable way to go for a for an initial thing and we can look at at exactly what you end up doing and and then figure out if there s some something that could be be hurt by the end part of the process
__label__False zero six eight two eight six one nine
__label__False i th i think that s g that s good
__label__False it s
__label__False so
__label__False uh they seem to have some problem with it we can we can talk about that later
__label__False ok
__label__False digit and alignment
__label__False although
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False wow
__label__False i think the machine is just sitting there
__label__False or what
__label__False and that s terrible
__label__False and uh it involves starting i believe starting with a
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s it s no more than six word so roughly on average that s pretty good i think it s better than a
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False nine two right
__label__False yeah if we look at the figure on the right we see that the reference system is very bad
__label__False and so well this is a point
__label__False and i do nt know what the e electronics is but
__label__False look a little bit like reichenbach for time
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah that make sense
__label__False um and on and on the um um
__label__False eh in twelve minute i found eh eh one thousand acoustic event
__label__False and so in a noisy situation um also in a in a situation that s very reverberant with long reverberation time and really long delay it s it s sort of typically impractical
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False is there any difference in
__label__False but if you have muddy condition training you get only twenty percent
__label__False i i i think that you could make the opposite argument that the wellmatched case is a fantasy
__label__False so y so you m s yeah but
__label__False yeah that i ve seen yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False actually the s those are two
__label__False that s sort of what we found
__label__False right
__label__False it s like forty plus forty plus
__label__False yeah
__label__False but did you do that before the thresholding to zero or
__label__False so
__label__False i
__label__False i i see no reason not to do all of them
__label__True so y you guy had a a meeting with uh with hynek which i unfortunately had to miss
__label__False and that that wa um trained on clean speech only which i m guessing is the reason why the baseline wa so bad
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False in my experiment i cheated in this way i mean another is what liz wa talking about how in the switchboard test in all the switchboard test we ve been g doing we ve been making the same er uh same uh uh standard using the same standard way of of getting the data to test on
__label__False it s possible
__label__False and the thing is it s not just a pure average because there are these weighting
__label__False i mean we could check i do nt think they do
__label__False so there s some kind of a a an effect from having these uh this broader coverage um
__label__False yeah
__label__True how do you spell that
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False o one three five two two nine
__label__False i d expect it to be a minor effect but
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh brian i
__label__False yeah amsterdam
__label__False yeah
__label__False so uh
__label__False so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh ok
__label__False mmm i m working with vt
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i use that to normalize the s the current center frame by mean subtraction
__label__False if the if your if your brain wa totally nondeterministic then perhaps there s a way to get uh infin an infinite number of construction that you d have to worry about
__label__False yeah there you go
__label__False then sort of feed you back to our original problem cuz uh how to get there what actually is happening there today and then maybe talk about the big picture here e tell a little bit a much a i can about the ntl story
__label__False hmm
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh actually i d i do all the smoothing yeah yeah
__label__False and did did you try simply to smooth um
__label__False ok
__label__False m m major major ok mayor something i do nt know about these ok ok
__label__False uh
__label__False autocorrelation yes yes the variance of the autocorrelation function that us that
__label__False um probably you would nt want to go to the extreme of just ta saying ok our feature set will be the fft cuz we really think we do gain something in robustness from going to something smoother but maybe there s something that we missed
__label__False here s the real experiment
__label__False so i so it it s it s a good wakeup call if people well we have this performance but you have to keep in mind we re doing we re we re not doing the whole real task in this way and this way and this way but
__label__False and compare how they perform to that but you know it depends on what the actual application is and it s really hard to know what your limit are in term of how many gaussians you can have
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s a shame we ca nt really give a number so it would be a number and a beep e
__label__False right cuz if it s like uh if it s four thing coming in right
__label__False so yeah
__label__False and if we have time i ll also add you know like choosing which speaker you wan na include and stuff but
__label__False pppt
__label__False i i wan na also say that you know this is a uh uh my my view on this is that once it s in a final version and i m working toward all these being final version then it can go into this next ro this next realm but it it s sort of counterproductive to have change made which i would be making if i d just gotten that far in the file you know it s it s um
__label__False i just wanted to uh s like mention a an issue um you know last meeting i wa nt here because i went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff and that wa pretty interesting and you know i mean seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh to what we re doing here because you know people are likely to give description like you know what s that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill or something like that you know meaning a few foot up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff so i mean i m sure in term of you know people trying to state location or you know all that kind of stuff this is gon na be very relevant so um now that wa the talk wa about english versus japanese um which obviously the japanese doe nt affect u directly except that um some of the construction he d what he talked about wa that you know in english we say thing like th you know your bike is parked across the street and we use these prepositional phrase you know well if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike but um in in japanese the the more conventionalized tendency is to use a sort of a description of
__label__False i mean so it s it s i mean you you re you re not necessarily gon na be sitting at the desk all the time you wan na figure you have a train ride and there s all these situation where where i
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False great no i ve not seen that
__label__False so it s better than the system that we had before
__label__False alright
__label__False i think that they pro i m i i wa nt there but i think they started off this process with the notion that you should be significantly better than the previous standard
__label__False uh
__label__False that sound great
__label__False yeah but i actually stuck most of this in our m last meeting with guenter
__label__False we do nt have any set of parameter where we can say you know only process from you know a hundred and ten hertz to thirtysevenfifty
__label__False stab at it yep
__label__False if you have a problem with it contact me and i ll give you a password seems like is a perfectly reasonable compromise and if they want a printout they can print it out themselves
__label__False um so um
__label__False ok so th sorry i just do nt kn um um um this is just uh xml mo notational but um the fact that it s action schema and then sort of slash action schema that s a whole entit that s a block whereas source is just an attribute is that
__label__False except that one s even bigger than most of the one i ve seen most of the one are just a little boom
__label__False stalk them at their
__label__False huh
__label__False it s alright she doe nt mind a long a we do nt video her right
__label__False um
__label__False um now one of the thing that s nice about what we did is we do have a a uh a filtering which lead to a a uh a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum which allows u to downsample
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah you really should nt be saying
__label__False umhmm
__label__False yeah yeah yeah yeah it is but i m saying there could be some some issue of
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm i think late uh i think in the summer sometime
__label__False beep seven beep eight beep eight beep
__label__False right
__label__False yeah but you re wired are nt you
__label__False well uh that s something s
__label__False yeah i guess i do nt think that the normalization difference is gon na account for everything
__label__False yeah that too yeah uhhuh
__label__False oh ok
__label__False that s the other problem
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False so when you go to a different task there s actually not so different it s when you went to these
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you re playing
__label__False yep
__label__False did you add more stuff to it later
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__False prosody
__label__False ok
__label__False he wa nt there at cof
__label__False so why do you get your best number in
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False so you sort of at that point you discretize thing into just having overlap or no overlap
__label__False yeah
__label__False i like word pad because it ha the uh the return the carriage return on some of them
__label__False um
__label__False and pratibha used five percent
__label__False uh i ll i ll sing a song or dance or something while you do it too
__label__False ok might wan na close the door so that uh stephane will
__label__False so this is this is this is gon na be a big big problem if you want to later do uh you know indexing or speech understanding of any sort
__label__False yeah just subtract that subtract that from the original signal and you re set
__label__False i i gave you a c couple example and
__label__False ok i mean that that part is ok but i but i do wonder sometimes if it might be possible to use a term that s a little bit le evaluative like um handmarked
__label__False exactly
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm so so so these number are simply yeah ok
__label__False sorry
__label__False so f if it s really in one kiosk then i think that you could just chain together and and you know a much a much speech a possible to because what you re really trying to get at is the is the reverberation characteristic
__label__False yeah i know that that yeah well in the proposal they were transformed u using pca but
__label__False yeah pretty common yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False um
__label__False well we could start with the good one but anyway so i think that we should try it once with the same condition that were used to create those and in those same segment just use one of the pzms
__label__False uh but um
__label__True yeah the one that uh people seem to use is uh hugin or whatever how exp i do nt think it s is it free because i ve seen it advertised in place so i it seems to
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False we will
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh meaning that tilman becker who doe the german one actually took out some time and already did it in english for u
__label__False one of the thing that people working in the meeting task wan na get at is they would like to have cleaner closemiked recording
__label__False i mean i w
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False well um
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False i see
__label__False so
__label__False i i i think that eh the possibility eh can be that eh
__label__False a actually it s that it s it s we would have to retrain model that are not that have none of that stuff uh in it but actually we could
__label__False mmm we know the thing that make use of this thing so that we can just change them so that they make use of rad
__label__False so where were we uh yeah
__label__False yes really i ha i ve
__label__False it s a pain
__label__False hmm
__label__False instead of just on the
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False one thing that i note are not here in this result but are speak are spoken before with sunil
__label__False pardon
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah so yeah so i i uh i i d mentioned to adam and that wa another thing i wa gon na talk uh mention to them before that uh there s uh it it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintance in local broadcast medium
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah we re all done
__label__False um are we going to look at multiband are we gon na look at combination of thing
__label__False it s not four
__label__False yeah
__label__False i m wondering if he were to just uh specify particular topic i mean
__label__False it it d be even more of one
__label__False is you mean two thousand one
__label__False ok so uh the idea is just to read each line with a short pause between line not between
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False um oh the other thing that i did wa um i compiled the htk stuff for the linux box
__label__False yeah
__label__False so so the upper part is training tidigits
__label__False but i i m just concerned of course about that
__label__False you could use they could use their own
__label__False right now we have nt observed it so i guess it s sort of averaging over all those three possibility
__label__False oh it s pretty slow
__label__False nine one eight four three six nine eight seven two
__label__False how do we d make the decision on a to which one to listen to
__label__False oh darn i have nt done that yet er ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False refined y re just refine the
__label__False it s a multiple of seven
__label__False um
__label__False yeah uh for example
__label__False no but wait a minute i
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False which is there in the spreadsheet i m not changing anything in there
__label__False it wa an interesting approximation put in parenthesis cuz i have this convention that i if they re not sure what it wa they put it in parenthesis
__label__False i see
__label__False to my understanding
__label__False so you estimated uh f completely forgetting what you had before
__label__False well they ve been putting them in their system off and on for ten year but but but uh
__label__False o five o two one eight seven zero seven zero two nine one two three zero zero five three six three five two four seven seven six four eight six two eight zero nine
__label__False yeah i wa thinking to do that next week
__label__False we prune very conservatively i mean a we saw with the meeting data um we could probably tighten the pruning without really
__label__False one two eight three one nine nine one one three
__label__False quite relevant yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False new york and you say
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i think uh probably uh
__label__False ok
__label__False s so they did filter their time signal and then what u
__label__False question comment on that
__label__False so so when
__label__False ok
__label__False n uh
__label__False good
__label__False sorry
__label__False yeah
__label__False aurora ha a clean subset i mean they want to train it and then this they re going to run some evaluation
__label__False so how do you know that what you have is too much if they re still deciding
__label__False oh i see you mean when only one person is talki yes we could we could try tha right
__label__True maybe i should write to brian and tell him what the problem wa and what our proposed solution are
__label__False ok what s the next thing
__label__False ok
__label__False and then they calculate from this the log energy or
__label__False yeah it s probably worth it
__label__False they they
__label__False ok i see
__label__False and is there is there enough data or a comparable comparable amount of data to to what we have in our recording here
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i mean you know we we can spend under a thousand dollar or something without without worrying about it
__label__False yeah it is
__label__False and it s also fivefifty megahertz and you can get a gigahertz
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s further away yeah
__label__False i m signing off
__label__False yeah and you can always make it shortly after three probably
__label__False and uh
__label__False in the multiband experiment in the first one we really wanted to find out what if you knew which band wa really noisy
__label__False no
__label__False and it wa nt trained on this task actually one percent is sort of you know sort of in a reasonable range people would say yeah i could i can imagine getting that
__label__False but in in reality it s you know there s all of this this overlap and so forth and but what i m saying is that may be ok because what you re really getting is not actually voiced versus unvoiced both for the fac the reason of the overlap and and then uh th you know structural reason uh uh like the one that chuck said that that in fact well the data itself is that you re working with is not perfect
__label__False i can put log of ex plus log
__label__False yeah
__label__False for these meeting
__label__False now you have to really add two to that because in htk there s an initial null and a final null so when they use uh model that have eighteen state there re really sixteen state they ve got those initial and final null state
__label__False uh
__label__False what i trying two mlp to to the with this new feature and the fifteen feature uh from the eh bus base system
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah so it s different yeah exactly cuz they do nt have these you know mismatch that that you guy have so that s why i wa wondering if maybe it s not even a good idea i do nt know
__label__False get a tape deck plug it in to the computer hit record on the tape deck and just do it all all uh analog
__label__False and then your second pas uh uh eliminates those most of those hypothesis by uh by having an improved improved version o of the analysis so
__label__False o zero one zero eight eight five three three seven one
__label__False another node on what
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean that s what they re good at
__label__False the system transfer function is such that when it s inverted you get something that s unstable and so if you you do your estimate of what the system is and then you try to invert it you get a filter that actually uh you know ring and and uh go to infinity so it s so there s there s there s that sort of technical reason and the fact that thing move and there s air current i mean there s all sort of all sort of reason why it s not really practical so for all those kind of reason uh we we we sort of um concluded we did nt want to in do inversion and we re even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation which is nt really inversion and um we decided to do this approach of taking uh just picking uh feature which were uh will give you more something that wa more stable in the presence of or absence of room reverberation and that s what brian wa trying to do
__label__False ok
__label__False uh so we can probably restrict it to be
__label__False oh we did that wa the last one i gave you
__label__False right
__label__False and um uh actually i wa talking to dick karp about it a little bit and and and since i got thinking about it and and uh so one thing is that y you d have to do i think uh we may have to do this on a whiteboard but i think you have to be a little careful about scaling the number that you re taking the complex number that you re taking the log of because the taylor expansion for it ha you know a square and a cube and and so forth and and so if if you have a a number that is modulus you know uh very different from one
__label__False so three is sound good
__label__False yeah
__label__False trying to track it down
__label__False i think so
__label__False mmhmm and for that well the goal is to obtain um est estimate a pdf for the noisy speech when we have a a statistic for clean speech and for the noisy speech
__label__False o six two one four
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you have a choice either you let people do it themselves or you do nt
__label__False master
__label__False so yeah th th that wa the question if if yeah
__label__False see you
__label__False oh they do
__label__False ok
__label__False uh
__label__False right
__label__False actually to make it worse uh morgan us you and you with gaze and no identification or
__label__False enter is high and infoon is high
__label__False it s at the hauptstrasse and gasse
__label__False so i mean this may be
__label__False if you want you c i can say something about the method
__label__False see i wa wondering cuz we st we have these ten hour of other stuff that is not yet transcribed do you
__label__False uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so you re saying take the feature that go into the voicedunvoiced silence net and feed those into the other one a additional input rather than having a separate
__label__False yeah i mean yeah it is nt always true and i think what we really want is some clever way to do this where um you know from the data or from maybe some handcorrected alignment from transcriber that thing like word that do occur just by themselves a alone like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it those would be able to do that but the rest would be constrained
__label__False that sixtyone point four
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh yes but this is not important it s systematic yeah
__label__False and i did nt bring my car today so i m gon na pick them up tomorrow
__label__False uh so that it look like it s an eight kilohertz sampled thing or
__label__False right and there s some happy medium and we do nt know what that is yet until we get feedback from people but what if it s ok to just handle it with sort of a person in charge of the philosophy behind the change and some people with permission maybe by request to make change that we do nt just give people permission if they re not gon na make change because i ve overwritten a a file by mistake not wanting to have done that cuz i did nt think i had permission when i did
__label__False i m sorry so when you say minus twentyfive or minus thirty db with respect to what
__label__False i m in control here
__label__False yeah it wa it wa uh the same system
__label__False so suppose you ve that what you really wan na do is put a good pitch detector on there and if it get an unambiguous if it get an unambiguous result then you re definitely in a in a in a voice in a uh s region with speech
__label__False wha
__label__False um we re sticking with the term wizard ok and um
__label__False so before estimating the snr smooth the envelope
__label__False something like that then we would guess aha he our beliefnet ha s stronger belief that he want to know where it is than actually want to go there
__label__False hmm
__label__False there you go
__label__False transcript l dash one four seven
__label__False xerxes allows you to say u just give me the value of that and that and that
__label__False great
__label__False yeah
__label__False i think morgan
__label__False o
__label__False this is mostly better than baseline although in some case it s a little worse in a couple case
__label__False no actually
__label__False the crown of pain
__label__False certainly doe
__label__False yeah
__label__False so when we input something we always get the uh posterior probability for all of these right
__label__False so you just pick one with the best sounding one and give it to somebody and they transcribe it
__label__False five nine five four eight eight three nine one four
__label__False i think the uh
__label__False i mean there are truly time when you have two totally independent goal that they might express at once but in this case it s really like there s a purpo mean that you know f for achieving some other purpose
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah we have nt a modified the recognizer at all so actually um at some point we should update and rescore everything with you know the corrected transcript just to h
__label__False we re gon na we re gon na do digit at the same
__label__False good
__label__False well actually i calculate all the mean first and then i do the subtraction
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False thirty
__label__False so if it s if it s um if it s low energy uh but the but the spectrum look like that or like that it s probably silence
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False but when you abbreviate yourself a the basman you do nt use any h s
__label__False and
__label__False i m sorry you ve been what showing them sharing them ok
__label__False they re very dependent
__label__False well let s just say that men are simple
__label__False so
__label__False oh ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False well i like in the case of yeah
__label__True and um so my my goal wa w m my charge wa to get eleven hour by the end of the month and it ll be i m i m i m clear that we ll be able to do that
__label__False no e yeah the
__label__False right
__label__False dang now i ll think of it
__label__False n not of the
__label__False and then they ll hear the speech
__label__False uh it s just sort of sitting right on the uh the column line
__label__False you laughed at me too the first time i sa said
__label__False interesting would you say that the like
__label__False i see
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False go wrong
__label__False ok yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False no no no i think i just tried it on speechdatcar
__label__False ok
__label__False um u other group it just depends on how many meeting we re we re having um
__label__False it s the ratio
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False so uh for example this this uh feature set called the uh sound pattern of english um is just a bunch of um binary valued feature
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh uh i have nt gone through the entire table yet yeah yesterday i brought chuck the table and i wa like wait this is
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False well and then you have the gender detection
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh no we like we we re we re w we are we re in the uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False ah
__label__False and so i ve uh i uh uh i ve trained the new one uh the new the newest one to um use the visual from the channel that is gon na be transcribed at any given time
__label__False yeah
__label__False then you can get the cuz you need if it s three hundred uh i i it sound like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy event right now that are really
__label__False you know always for the matched condition you always get a slightly better performance for log energy than czero
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False it doe nt
__label__False i mean i think
__label__False yeah
__label__False and in that case you probably do nt wan na have it be endless because you wan na have some sort of it s it s not a question of how long do you think it s you can get an approximation to a stationary something given that it s not really stationary so
__label__False that s fine
__label__False well the
__label__False and the same we will be able to do for syntactic information the verb used the object type used modifier
__label__False it sound like they do nt really have a good idea about what the final application is gon na be
__label__False i guess the real question is where would we put it and who would do it i guess whoever record the meeting
__label__False guess we re done
__label__False oh i m
__label__False so i
__label__False so
__label__False ok well i did nt realize that that s that s a
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False and w we should get the two meeting from y i mean i know about the first meeting um but the other one that you did the nsa one which we had nt done cuz we were nt running recognition on it because the nonnative speaker there were five nonnative speaker
__label__False ok
__label__False you would nt do like rone over rzero or something like that
__label__False that s correct
__label__False because
__label__False the k kind that guy that like to look like they re really cool at airport wear
__label__False i wa just gon na s
__label__False the method propose to develop this in a vectorial taylor series approximation
__label__False today s
__label__False i guess we can um and that s going to be more just you and me because bhaskara is doing probabilistic recursive structured objectoriented uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i m sorry something seems to have gone wrong with our system so i m going to have to take over from here what can i help you with
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__True i also copied uh the result that we all got in the mail i think from uh from ogi and we ll go go through them also
__label__False but uh it s basically we already talked about all this stuff so
__label__False one percent
__label__False but that mean anyone in the meeting recorder group can overwrite the file
__label__False ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False um so the delta at the end is how much
__label__False you you ve talked me into that but i i just think that we should make it harder to do
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False not really no um my project is going along but um i m really just here to um fill the project uh the overall progress
__label__False yeah it ha some music also i mean very horrible music like like x
__label__False what should i observe
__label__False i i guess three wireds work yeah
__label__False americanborn folk uh reading german
__label__False and then the final log energy that they that they get that to the to that they add some random noise
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i m finished
__label__False around
__label__False i do nt know what is the different name eh you use to to name the the n speech
__label__False one plus n by x
__label__False and uh the vad is used uh i for online normalization and it s used before the delta computation
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh so although you you can pipe it a well we tend to do it that way because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep redoing it over and over
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False that s their initiation into our w
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False no but h i mean he probably ha to go do something right
__label__False andreas
__label__False yeah just a two three two four that would be
__label__False and each meeting is roughly half a gig and so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False wait maybe it s ok so that that that we can that we have one node per construction
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False uh right uh
__label__False where doe the comprish compression in decoding delay come from
__label__False yeah
__label__False so this is the feature that are used by our network and then afterwards you have to compute the delta on the uh main feature stream which is um delta and doubledeltas which is fifty millisecond
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that s a that s another argument to keep it separate because it s gon na follow the smartkom transcription convention and not the
__label__False there s a bandwidth issue right yeah
__label__False so they have their own compression and decoding scheme and they i do nt know what they have but they have coded zero delay for that
__label__False hmm
__label__False so bhaskara is switching project a of the first of june and uh he s gon na leave u an inheritance which is a uh hopefully a beliefnet that doe these thing
__label__False i i
__label__False um performance of the current vad
__label__False ok leave leave them on for a moment until i turn this off cuz that s when it crashed last time
__label__False never tested it with the compensation but without uh compensation it wa like fifteen wa s slightly better than thirteen so that s why we stuck to thirteen
__label__False you can you can you can do certain normalization like you know gain control uh before you do the clustering to rule out those those type of thing
__label__False i ve i ve written a program to do that and it uh and so but it s it s doing something very very simple it just take a threshold based on on the volume
__label__False that s a good idea
__label__False yep
__label__False liz and i had discussion last week about how to proceed with uh you know with don s work and and and uh one of the obvious thing that occur to u wa that we re since we now have thilo s segmenter and it work you know amazingly well um we should actually basically reevaluate the recognition um result using you know without cheating on the segmentation
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False i guess one way of describing would be if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band is it sonorant in that band is it sonorant in that band i it s hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant so then it come down to you know to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision
__label__False um so i i guess the idea to this is that it it is reputed to uh be somewhat better in that regard
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah so that s that s that s what
__label__False the filter bank which is created by integrating over ff t bin um
__label__False if you do man custom it ha almost all of that
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False it s available to them if they ask for it
__label__True um researcher at atandt a while back that wa studying trying to do speech recognition from these kind of feature
__label__False is is there a r there s a re
__label__False ok
__label__False suddenly the don they do nt match at all and you ca nt line them up anymore
__label__False a if i understand it correctly it always give you all the posterior probability for all the value of all decision node
__label__False wow
__label__False right right
__label__False uh he sent it
__label__False mmm that d be something to look at sometime because what um eh he wa looking at wa performance in this room
__label__False m yeah
__label__False you d you really now i i spent the last time i wa there i spent maybe two hour hearing this story which is um
__label__False the uh other thing i wa wondering wa um if the neural net um ha any because of the different noise con unseen noise condition for the neural net where like you train it on those four noise condition while you are feeding it with like a additional some four plus some f few more condition which it ha nt seen actually from the f f while testing um instead of just h having c uh those cleaned up t cepstrum sh should we feed some additional information like
__label__False is one of you going to be the subject is one of you jump in
__label__False then there s i know but yeah it s number three it say but we ll be able to figure it out this is at the middle of the table
__label__False sure
__label__False the purpose wa not really at this stage to come up with meaningful probability but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer
__label__False car run into telephone pole all the time
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False i believe it
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False hmm
__label__False cuz there s baseline aurora above it
__label__False right right
__label__False it s weird
__label__False ok
__label__False well
__label__False s
__label__False so
__label__False to completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reason but i but not to try to completely remove it that is invert the the room response but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the the effect of some of the echo
__label__False so um uh
__label__False and i m now uh trying the
__label__False let s just assume our bayesnet just ha three decision node for the time being
__label__False hmm
__label__False um nine o six seven three nine three three
__label__False i mean you could feed it a bunch of s you could feed two number that you wanted to multiply into a net and have a bunch of nonlinearities in the middle and train it to get the product of the output and it would work
__label__False did nt she give one of them to one of the transcriber
__label__False i see
__label__False six six three one zero six five eight seven six
__label__True uh but yo i noticed people do use hugin so um
__label__False yeah
__label__False lineout into the linein on a tape player and
__label__False yeah
__label__False you re just talking about playing it and recording it like realtime
__label__False the full uh i so if you trained on half a much and made the net uh uh half a big then it would be one fourth the amount of time and it d be nearly a good
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i have two case d where the first case is where the constant is twentyfive db below the mean speech energy and the other is thirty db below
__label__False he di he did uh yeah
__label__False i ve been eating a lot
__label__False and um running the program
__label__False and um so and they both had some kind of online normalization right
__label__False um
__label__False di dif different different bandwidth
__label__False ma
__label__False in fact actually i g i guess the uh the spanish government uh requires that anyway they want some kind of report from everybody who s in the program so
__label__False uh standard are always optional
__label__False yeah
__label__False but uh
__label__False might be
__label__False yep
__label__False but it look like um
__label__False right
__label__False and the lda that we are f applying is only in time not in frequency high cost frequency so it s like more like a filtering in time rather than doing a r
__label__False so we have spurt and we have spurtify dot shell and spurtify
__label__False mmm yeah
__label__False actually it would nt be bad to have that plus put on that machine a cd burner
__label__False it s nine db
__label__False right
__label__False oh and and we have a little time on that and actually so
__label__False again let s you know sort of circulate the the wording on each of these thing and get it right but but
__label__False but to solve our problem ag uh a mediocre design will do i think in the beginning
__label__False oh right this wa the mix up stuff that s right i remember now
__label__False mmm
__label__False exactly right
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm hey i bet there s tea
__label__False you can use a speaker eh what about gender detection
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False so i wa like i m trying to find where the m m problem came and it seems to be like somewhere some silly stuff
__label__False i think it s i think it s different it s it s something that yeah that affect more or le the silence portion because
__label__False ok and
__label__False right that doe nt hurt the current way
__label__False oh i could i could submit that to aurora that would be pretty pretty
__label__False ok
__label__False it seemed like the right thing to do
__label__False why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode
__label__False yeah
__label__False but they ve been looking at uh at these issue at the online normalization and the uh voice activity detection
__label__False there you go yeah yeah
__label__False well no fre for the most
__label__False that s connected too or
__label__False i mean we re sure gon na interface to
__label__False we can do a realignment that s true
__label__False sure look
__label__False so there s the the lda is is right there before the hmms
__label__False i di
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False well yeah so this is just partly to inform everybody um and and of course to get um input
__label__False so in term of the this we had we had initially we d started discussing the out of film
__label__False yeah
__label__False if you want to see the magic flute or something
__label__False yeah we should do this th the upcoming day
__label__False i see
__label__False and so i told i said it would take about a day i ve worked on it for about half a day so give me another half day and i we ll have something we can play with
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False but we have like thirty you know from ten year ago no
__label__True when would they do that
__label__False hmmmmmmmm bill gate duhduhduhduh but but it wa all the word were all visible but they did nt end up i some there wa a slip in the transcript
__label__False well um for italian and spanish it s th this value work good but not necessarily for finnish
__label__True i think that stephane will arrive today or tomorrow
__label__False yeah
__label__False i do nt know if i totally am happy with the way it is
__label__False i think it probably leaf it open how we get it to them
__label__False i th i think i i think they are yeah
__label__False i wan na talk a little bit about getting how we re gon na to get people to edit bleep part of the meeting that they do nt want to include
__label__False you you have to go a little early right
__label__False i i think uh mike tried it and he say it s impossible so he went to octave
__label__False we it it s slightly uh different because
__label__False do we have like a cabinet on order or do we just need to do that
__label__False but actually it had an interface a lot of them were like you know
__label__False see w
__label__False yeah
__label__False now th yeah
__label__False so it s an additional thirty percent
__label__False so just having the three output thing doe nt doe nt really buy you anything
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so maybe um chronos or
__label__False we have a day or so so
__label__False yeah so perhaps we could have a a large gain eh just by looking at improving the uh recognition not of phoneme but of phoneme class simply
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh yeah of course german yeah
__label__False yeah maybe somebody else will come along and will be uh interested in working on it and could start off from where you are also you know
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah so d well
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah be cool and help science
__label__False oh it doe
__label__False yep
__label__False um
__label__False and well it s a little bit better but not n
__label__False it yeah we re calling these spurt after chafe i wa trying to find what s a word for a continuous region with pause around it
__label__False right so if we if we fed the handsegmentation to javier s and it doe nt work then we know something s wrong
__label__False well it seems like they should do like the percentage improvement or something rather than the absolute improvement
__label__False um or or even if i m using our system i wa thinking it might be easier to just resynthesize the audio because then i could just feacalc a is and i would nt have to change the code
__label__False h he probably need u to approve another time to take thing down right in order to do that
__label__True then i m also going to present a little talk at eml about what we have done here and so of course i m i m gon na start out with this slide so the most relevant aspect of our stay here and um then i m asking them to imagine that they re standing somewhere in heidelberg and someone asks them in the morning the cave fortyfive is a is a wellknown discotheque which is certainly not open at that that time
__label__False just visiting
__label__False right
__label__False right so the
__label__False or having is also um associated with location right so if the film left you know state is being near film
__label__False hmm
__label__False eva
__label__True that is a a good check point you should do that anyway ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False well
__label__False i mean i g i guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two side cuz because um uh i wa talking with hynek about it later and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much
__label__False it um
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok so it s who un two hundred and ten
__label__False hmm
__label__False so um i mean the main the the
__label__False oh
__label__False except the variance is quite high yeah
__label__False i think it wa nine gig and another one had seventeen
__label__False i do nt think so
__label__False it d be impossible to r to misorder them
__label__False well not just the overlap everything
__label__False what about putting the stuff on like c cdrom or dvd or something
__label__False uh no
__label__False approach and then enter
__label__False scale
__label__False we what set the they set the context to unknown
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so just r r truly chron chromatically up all the way through the entire meeting
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah oh you do nt ok
__label__False oh ok
__label__False so first question would be to what extent i are the error that you re still seeing based on the fact that you have poor boundary for the uh uh nonspeech
__label__False vtl because if you do nt do vtl in both system uh you know the the female are considerably worse in the with the plp feature
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False you can
__label__False ok let s just let s just name the microphone
__label__False yeah they can still check it out
__label__False so you could run that post hoc on a already recorded meeting in the sense that you know not everyone a you just said you wo nt be there and then if we find any problem have the transcriber listen and i really think it s better not to transcribe a meeting that s gon na have problem once you ve spent all this effort
__label__False but uh
__label__False we re talking about thirty to sixty percent uh error rate reduction
__label__False yep
__label__False you had a you had a little
__label__False um well he said um we definitely yes however there is always more people in a in a facul uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else s class at the moment and one should sort of reach out and try and get them all
__label__False is nt that next week
__label__False but do you know for instance h how far down it would be at twenty hertz
__label__False see this is where we really need the meeting recorder query stuff to be working because we ve had these meeting and we ve had this discussion about this and i m sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided but i could nt remember all of it so
__label__False but we ve done a bunch of thing where we just trained on one language right
__label__False um we have absolute no we have absolutely no mean of enforcing that so it would be considered valid if we have an spg action enter and no spg schema but a forced action schema
__label__False we can take we can have a pool
__label__False oh yeah he wa talking he wa talking i mean uh we he had
__label__False yeah
__label__False the b for the f it wa m m march probably
__label__False yeah
__label__False transcript l dash w one one five zero six four seven three two two seven one zero eight seven five eight six seven three seven five seven five five one one nine one four nine eight four one nine three one zero zero two four one zero three six eight two one nine six two eight nine six nine one eight six five six five zero three one one six six three nine eight seven eight three nine eight nine
__label__False right
__label__False goat eat can to my understanding
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__True i i may have to go to switzerland for in june or beginning of july for between two week and four week but uh after that or before that
__label__False are we g just gon na keep recording like at some point
__label__False yeah that s the only place that we can train we ca nt train the other stuff with anything other than the standard amount so
__label__False well i
__label__False and so
__label__False oh i see
__label__False tho good the good number the bad number were from the segment where there wa overlap
__label__False i mean really m a lot more than we have here right cuz we re not right on campus so
__label__False time
__label__False there s the the median filter is enforcing that it s not gon na be single case of frame or isolated frame
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and uh he did not say look at point where you were changing broad sp uh phonetic class for instance
__label__False oh
__label__False great
__label__False but um
__label__False well that that say that you know the um the model in in uh the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net feature
__label__False so that sort of sound like they re not doing that yet
__label__False um why
__label__False so basically it s almost binary decision and um the idea of using more class is to get something that s le binary decision
__label__False yes that s great
__label__False you know so they they they have you know they re volunteering their time and they have a lot of other thing to do right but they
__label__False ah yeah it s ok
__label__False i do nt h i do nt have any stock in htk or entropic or anything
__label__False and i know everything
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False if they do something on a computer in a format we can handle we could give them a text file that wa a template with speaker id and beep already in it
__label__False test
__label__False then we put them tog together
__label__False ok fine let s let s use the conventional meaning of baseline i i
__label__False and that s i mean i i wa using that for a while when i wa doing the rate of speech stuff because i because i looked up in some book and i found ok i wan na find a spurt in which and an because cuz it s another question about how many pause they put in between them but how fast do they do the word within the spurt yeah
__label__False probably do nt want all zero most recognizers do nt like zero but but you know put some epsilon in or some rand sorry epsilon random variable in or something
__label__False um
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s great
__label__False oh ok
__label__False right the individual segment between the beep
__label__False ok
__label__False it s well all these number are the ratio with respect to the baseline
__label__False but do you have it here
__label__False i guess see that s what i suggested to him that people like like jerry and george and et cetera just
__label__False this exact same recognizer no
__label__False so the reference file for the relative time at which so
__label__False and good one good one which sometimes mean a little extra time
__label__False oh
__label__False um
__label__False but
__label__False i would stop sending them the my data and i would start collecting it here and we would end up with two corpus
__label__False so so where are we in this let s see so we now we now have a few mike that work how long did it take you to set this up
__label__False yeah
__label__False and ma maybe maybe chafe did i know i know ch chafe dealt with
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok i used it in transcriber and it s it s in the
__label__False i probably corrected something like well s it s really a substantial amount of thing that i ve caught changed um added to it
__label__False um and um
__label__False yeah that one need a lot of
__label__False if we are in fact gon na have forty or fifty hour at some point and we we wan na ha have part of our work be on feature extraction it mean that we need to have waveform available somehow
__label__False no
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False yep
__label__False oh ok that explains it partially
__label__False and correcting
__label__False well ten
__label__False but any so that e e it s clear then i think
__label__False yeah
__label__False in other news
__label__False yes again
__label__False yeah
__label__False and so it s it s not it s not actually very consistent across so
__label__False i mean when when it s on you can see it you can definitely see it absolutely absolutely
__label__False one point four
__label__False so you do nt have one for unvoiced picture
__label__False liz wa talking about i decided that i would do um only enough to get it working a opposed to any coding
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah but y y if you find walked smacked into the cafe or slammed into the wall
__label__False w wait wait a minute wait a minute
__label__False there could be a communication event action or something like that and you could write it
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__False so i i still think it s potentially interesting to do that although we we ll have to be uh a aware of this if we re writing proposal about it wherever that there may well be reviewer who will say well everyone know that you ca nt get anything out of it if it s if it s close
__label__False yeah there are twenty that come from
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s what i thought i f i wa going through them all and i found actually a lot filed in with them that were blank that no one had actually read and so we still have more than i thought we did so we have a few more digit before we re done
__label__False so we d have a node for the whereis question
__label__False onl only i i transcribe eh only twelve minute from the but eh i i do nt co eh i do nt count eh the the overlap
__label__False sound like fey
__label__False well i it s an interesting question because i wa thinking well you can force align the transcriber transcript and then of course you try to merge them in time
__label__False right
__label__False the first one is three then seven seven and seven
__label__False five
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and we re recording only this meeting like continuously we re only recording this one now or ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False that might be worth it
__label__False oh um
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False because it s just an added bunch of weird stuff and you know we we h we re highly motivated
__label__False excellent
__label__False advertise in their class a well
__label__False would you really say that
__label__False well one thing i mean if i if if i start um reducing the number of state for some of these shorter model that s gon na reduce the total number of gaussians so in a sense it ll be a simpler system
__label__False ok good i liked that one
__label__True adam and and uh chuck and me should talk about should get together and talk about that sometime soon
__label__False um
__label__False it s ok
__label__False that s a good idea
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False well
__label__False yeah
__label__False i in berkeley yeah
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False so so again then we have these broad class and well somewhat broad i mean it s twentyseven instead of sixtyfour basically
__label__False well we should be able to just go buy some preamps i would think
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh ok yeah so that is what i wanted to know
__label__False maybe an elaborate one cuz again they probably are gon na do these alignment which will also clear thing up
__label__False um
__label__False i know this is mine here
__label__False i mean there s the state of california downstairs and
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean unless you re searching searching of course should be electronic but if you re not so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that but see then we re getting more elaborate with this thing
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so like unless are there reason why one is better than the other i mean that come from other source
__label__False there wa a
__label__False i can understand the effect of this no because it s to to do something like that
__label__False or just yeah start by make it a really tight control and then a people really need the control you can ascertain whether or not to
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so uh maybe we should move on to other other thing in limited time
__label__False so how are you doing the
__label__False o zero zero nine two seven two one three zero one zero zero three three six o one nine eight four four five seven zero six seven eight o
__label__False and uh she end up getting the agenda request uh uh ten minute before the meeting but but but
__label__False yeah i think that s what it is
__label__False and and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of of what s going on much le any kind of reasonable statistic
__label__False yeah but we ve had more problem with that
__label__False right
__label__False right other syntactic information you mean yeah
__label__False so giving them you think a web site to say if you wan na print it out here it is is not sufficient
__label__False well because if you just touch alt a if you just hit it once it ll go back to the previous application
__label__False e well there you go yes that s that it look sort of like that
__label__False their reputation is very bad huh
__label__False and then g the same about goal
__label__False six nine one four zero five seven nine five six nine two
__label__False can we add just so i can see how it s done uh a ha door property or
__label__False ok let let s do a
__label__False and then maybe we ll discover the phenomenon the phenomenon that we want to solve you know with whatever engine we we come up with
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah that s right
__label__False i wa the one who said it wa not reliable the they they wear out
__label__False you were gon na say something else
__label__False alright
__label__False zero five nine six one five zero two five
__label__False yeah
__label__False s
__label__False he did
__label__False pierced tongue and
__label__False this wa all
__label__True yeah i do nt know if javabayes is nice about that it might be that if you add a new thing pointing to a variable you just like it just overwrites everything
__label__False and then display all the user interface component
__label__False no that s not a problem i l look it seems to me that if we re doing it anyway and we re doing it for these these purpose that we have and we have these distant mike we definitely should re should save it all a long a we ve got disk space and disk is pretty cheap so should we save it
__label__False alright
__label__False yep
__label__False with what
__label__False one
__label__False and then there s mass
__label__False well you seem to know better than we do so
__label__False oh oh ok
__label__False yes i did and furthermore i found that there were a certain number where not not a lot but several time i actually moved an utterance from adam s channel to dan s or from dan s to adam s so there wa some speaker identif
__label__False yeah i mean i think that uh a much a you can it s good to d sort of not do anything really tricky
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True and somewhere is my agenda
__label__False yeah
__label__False no that s really interesting
__label__False no i mean i mean seriously if you if you have a very
__label__False so di
__label__False yeah we we should try
__label__False all contact
__label__False that s
__label__False um
__label__False i mean maybe it doe make a difference in term of performance computational time so either you always have it compute all the posterior possibility for all the value for all node and then prune the one you think that are irrelevant or you just make a p a priori estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those
__label__False yeah we were talking about that a little bit over coffee today that that um uh if you downsample it sounded like it came it sounded like it wa something like a gig gigabyte an hour if you did nt downsample and once you downsampled then it wa something like four hundred megabyte an hour if you used all if you used all no if you used all the channel something like that
__label__False right s see you
__label__False so there must be some something else going on
__label__False um so the last week uh i showed some result with only speechdatcar which wa like some fiftysix percent
__label__False some people think that it s more important to look at to have ten percent imp relative improvement on wellmatched case than to have fifty percent on the m mismatched and other people think that it s more important to improve a lot on the mismatch and
__label__False yeah so i g
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok so uh
__label__False so my expectation is tidigits would especially
__label__False so do
__label__False i m still trying to make it better by using some other feature from the after the p clean up maybe some uh correlation autocorrelation or some s additional feature of to mainly the improvement of the vad
__label__False and then when you have your final thing do a full one so it s
__label__False yeah a a he is wont to do yeah
__label__False but it s kind of crazy cuz we know how to multiply and you you d be you know much lower error usually if you just multiplied it out
__label__False well an
__label__False versus if they heard a slightly different one
__label__False yeah
__label__False well l i guess what i m thinking of is that w that a lot of time there will be they ll put in question mark that represent some unknown amount of speech so we re gon na have to have some kind of
__label__False the i
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False what wa the question
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh the software currently just ha uh a allows for i think the one one hot output so you re having multiple net and combining them or
__label__False uh
__label__False but uh i do nt know this meeting so say it s maybe going to be a half hour or something and and uh we ve heard estimate ranging between ten and twenty time uh real time to do this kind of transcription um so you know in in principle then it ll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this
__label__False yep
__label__False right
__label__False you know these little boom one like and really go to meeting with close talking mike if they re their own personal microphone
__label__False so uh in practice
__label__False uh yes the first experiment that i do it is solely to calculate the mmm well this value uh the compensation of the dictionary o one time using the the noise at the f beginning of the sentence this is the first experiment and i fix this for all the all the sentence
__label__False crunchy frog
__label__False they re just doing right right so what we do is uh when i go to um select meeting for ibm i go into the um well into the the uh master sheet here with the status and i pick one that thilo ha um presegmented and i change the status to transip ibm so that you know when jane or whoever go to select the next meeting they wo nt choose one of those
__label__False uh no we re having the them do it so it s so handsoldering it but i m not doing it
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah that s
__label__False so until you re ready to check it in nobody see anything you ve done and then when you check it in it put sort of you know every change that you ve done is go into the central
__label__False yeah no i i think there s lot of lot of good thing to do with this
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so like if i m just interested in the goingthere node
__label__False that s a good point
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False two one eight seven one six five one eight four eh five eh seven six eight eh nine zero one two t two two five eight five two eight nine five seven seven eight
__label__False for this the conclusion of hynek wa well
__label__False and for some of the others it s their ear were shaped in a way that did nt hold the
__label__False yeah
__label__False um pretty much yes but
__label__False i do nt think it s still true when we add noise and so we have i i guess the confusion ma the confusion matrix are very different when when we have noise and when it s clean speech
__label__False the overlap ok
__label__False because uh we do nt we did nt
__label__False you know i ve been wondering about something in the um a lot of the um the hubfive system um recently have been using lda and and they um
__label__False do you have anything morgan or
__label__False oh
__label__False ok
__label__False you understand me
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh you want a lexical example
__label__False and he s uh been at ibm for the last couple year
__label__False i mean i i m i m not saying it s necessary but but uh i uh uh i you might be able to combine you know text uh and and some sort of picture and also uh i think it it will be a good idea to show them the text and kind of chew the task and then take the test away the the the the the text away so that they are not uh guided by by by what you wrote but can come up with their with their own
__label__False do y do you have that feature available for the test data
__label__False so
__label__False is that what the keith node is
__label__False whether the and this i we actually have a separate feature but i decided to put it on the same line for space
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False of what the building
__label__False and then displayed
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yep
__label__False somebody can have discussed the admission fee and u the answer is s if we um you know um still based on that result is never going to enter that building you know because it s just too expensive
__label__False that s what we re aiming for
__label__False and all of the pc are connected to the network too here or uh bad
__label__False one of u yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah but another way of looking at it might be that i mean what w we we are coming up with feature set after all
__label__True the transcontinental railroad doe nt that ring a bell
__label__False but yes you can set it to un unknown
__label__False let s see i have nt done a whole lot on anything related to this this week i ve been focusing mainly on meeting recorder stuff
__label__False wow
__label__False is that it
__label__False mmm
__label__False but uh
__label__False oh i see
__label__False so how much is that used in german
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so for instance in in the in a telephone task these are different phone call so you do nt wan na chain it together from a from a different phone call
__label__False oh ok
__label__False that s fine
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False no no how many of them were the overlap of speech though
__label__False what are we why are we writing it down
__label__False sixty two
__label__False yeah
__label__False two three week
__label__False um
__label__False and i the interpolation i between the point is give for the triang triangular filter the value of the triangular filter and of this way we obtained this mode this model speech
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah we need to i think that there s a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards and uh e especially since these people wo nt be uh used to dealing with multichannel uh transcription so i think that we ll need to adjust some and also if we wan na add thing like um well more refined coding of overlap then definitely i think we should count on having an extra pas through
__label__False yeah any idea what the curve look like
__label__False ok
__label__False it s mostly a question of user interface how do we how do we specify which one are on
__label__False yeah
__label__False the safety net
__label__False yep
__label__False so xschemas then i would like to do talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our bayesnet
__label__False no no it ha i do nt think you re saying the data is cheating i think you re saying
__label__False i think s that uh there were some other very good result that we re gon na wan na compare to
__label__False i gues
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we have to m m switch to this o
__label__False one o four o one two three eight o
__label__False you know you just fake the format that you take a input with the synch time to a new set of synch time and
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i i have no idea
__label__False uh why don why do nt we do it
__label__False um
__label__False i ca nt remember where uh wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of
__label__False yeah i m sure he d love to
__label__False well you know the the thing is that if you look at the number on the on the more difficult case um if you really believe that wa gon na be the predominant use none of this would be good enough nothing anybody s whereas you sort of with some reasonable error recovery could imagine in the better case that these these system working
__label__False actually
__label__False ok
__label__False so we re taking these uh alignment from the individual channel
__label__False no metaphor whatsoever
__label__False oh ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well no i mea i mean the fir oh jus ok
__label__False and then after that then this would probably work
__label__False it d be more than that because i my recollection is the minute that da digit do nt take more than half a minute per person
__label__False ok transcript two seven nine one dash two eight one zero
__label__False on am i on i think i m on good good
__label__False yeah it s a schematic tourist map so it ll be uh i it ll still require the that information and
__label__False i mean i m not too worried because the group s pretty small
__label__False ok i m sorry i missed the
__label__False that s fine
__label__False yeah the mix up right
__label__False you d uh probably have to transfer in chicago
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False so we we only r hav i only looked at actually alignment from one meeting that we chose i think mr four just randomly um
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i think that s probably worthwhile doing
__label__False yeah
__label__False so is this the official end of the meeting now
__label__False bread roll
__label__False four seven seven four four two three six four seven
__label__False pro probably not your mark in the kitchen today not not your mark
__label__False well i i i think we ca nt throw away that data cuz otherwise we ll end up with very few meeting but
__label__False yeah
__label__False cuz
__label__False you could have um each speaker in the meeting say beep and record it and that will be their pro
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh the ok the aurora system
__label__True when is the next um aurora deadline
__label__False right
__label__False six seven three seven four seven four three o
__label__False but it s really not i mean an object can be very salient but not a landmark at all
__label__False uh right
__label__False uh transcription uh beyond the digit where we are and so on
__label__False so that mean we re p getting pretty close
__label__False this is what s nice about the aurora data and the data here is that is that it s sort of a realistic room situation uh acoustic acoustic situation both term in noise and reflection and so on and n n
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__False and at that point then it s ready for use by liz and don
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False huh
__label__False so this wa for the plp
__label__False yeah to decide which one is yeah
__label__False hhh i do nt know like
__label__False yeah i m just thinking you know when you re when you re face to face you have a lot of backchannel and
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False well if he doe nt want to go there even if the enter posterior proba so
__label__False d doe latency sorry go ahead
__label__False yeah
__label__False sure yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False well
__label__False and it
__label__False no we prefer to keep it for ourselves
__label__False and to make it really clear that they knew it so that wa i think why why it became a popular term
__label__False yeah
__label__False um but with uh wiener filtering from um france telecom included
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False well any case where the people are not all sitting at the same place and they re not moving around too much
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah maybe just be different kind of distribution and and yeah so that s another possible thing
__label__False mmm
__label__False and so um
__label__False in our scheme we re gon na try to train it up to do a well well a it can at predicting
__label__False we should at least get a first one
__label__False so having having uh a g a l a greater number of feature if they are nt maybe the right feature that you use certainly can e can easily uh make thing worse
__label__False like german train are really great so
__label__False and so basically you just say you know
__label__False well you d think that d be more like speechdatcar i guess in term of the noise
__label__False yeah then it s something to do
__label__False in the proposal well in in the system we want to add like speech frame before every word and a little bit of of uh s a couple of frame after also
__label__False yep yep for those those we can make several several more of these and then we can have actual recording with you know three pda
__label__False oh
__label__False so th
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__False and so this doe this is uh first of all it explains something that i ve always wondered about and i ll do this this test on you guy a well so
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False so then you re gon na feed the those into some standard recognizer uh wh are you gon na do digit or
__label__False uh right no i have nt had a chance to do that
__label__False we re a casual user but we want a chance to change the transcript then we can face that if it happens but
__label__False yeah ok yeah
__label__False but i mean the other thing that we talked about is uh pitchrelated thing and harmonicityrelated thing so which we thought also should be some kind of a reasonable indicator
__label__False uh yeah a linux box yeah it s got uh like sixteen channel going into it
__label__False um
__label__False right there s just probably le backchanneling in general even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting but we ll find out anyway we were i guess the other thing we re we re i should say is that we re gon na um try compare this type of overlap analysis to switchboard where and callhome where we have both side so that we can try to answer this question of you know is there really more overlap in meeting or is it just because we do nt have the other channel in switchboard and we do nt know what people are doing
__label__False yeah
__label__False what if you did the would it make sense to do the klt on the full set of combined feature
__label__False that s true we could just subset it
__label__False so maybe i ll i ll start with that actually uh um
__label__False and um
__label__False it s not really what s happening in the vocal tract so you re not really getting the vocal excitation
__label__False simple
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False to remove the noise too
__label__False well that s that s a way that s you know the spellcheck basically doe that but but in addition yes that s that s exactly the strategy i wan na do in term of locating these thing which are you know colloquial spoken form which are nt in the lexicon
__label__False and the other thing is from the standpoint of the l of the l i m not a law lawyer but it strike me that uh we would nt want someone to say oh yes i wa a little concerned about it but it wa too hard to access
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False what s the relation between that limit and the um fortyeight uh forty eight hundred bit per second
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean it sure there there might be a place where it s
__label__False and there s help help they seem they seem good though they seem to be
__label__False you re just using the full ninety feature
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False two two eight three three zero five five nine five
__label__False forced align
__label__False i have to go
__label__False yeah so bu uh i the way the uh the dialogue manager work is it dump out what it want to know or what it want to tell the person to a er in xml and there s a conversion system for different uh to go from xml to something else and th so the knowledge base for the system that generates the syntasti syntactic structure for the ge generation is uh in a lisplike the knowledge base is in a lisplike form and then the thing that actually build these syntactic structure is something based on prolog
__label__False i think he had one twentyeight eh but
__label__False yeah
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False r i m reading transcript l dash one one three six five six nine seven two eight four four o eight seven five one eight seven four zero five seven zero two four two five o three seven six eight one seven seven nine two one seven nine zero nine zero six zero five six eight eight five nine five two two two five five six six two nine one one seven two zero six seven one six two zero two three zero one nine zero two three
__label__False hmm
__label__False ok
__label__False right now the word like partial word are reject model and you normally allow those to match to any word but then the background speech wa also a reject model and so this constraint of not allowing reject in between you know it need to differentiate between the two so just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kind of issue
__label__False so uh morgan is uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False no
__label__False this is the idea
__label__False but uh
__label__False yeah so
__label__False so you take uh you know i m not sure how many frame you need but you take that many from the front and flip it around to a a the negative value so you can always
__label__False we have two
__label__False right their maintenance people
__label__False um
__label__False right
__label__False oh so you uh so you really set it to zero the fft
__label__False get our
__label__False oh right
__label__False eh i i i do i do nt need to to to mmm to m to label the the different acoustic but i prefer because eh
__label__False background crunch yeah
__label__False wait the
__label__False i m i m never happy when he us the word role i m
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well so here s the thing
__label__False definitely when they do nt align at all it it it fails
__label__False i think we re gon na hit a lot of interesting problem and a i prefaced it this is the result of one week of arguing about it and um and so
__label__False yeah i ll can make an can like make a c comparison of of the old system to the to the new one and then yeah
__label__False did you read it twice or what
__label__False well if i could find phone number that would certainly work but
__label__False yay nay
__label__False ok i have four now because i left one with dave because i thought i wa dropping one off and passing the others on so no we re not ok
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False i m uh had nt quite followed this process um
__label__False o eight three seven three four six one nine
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and um it ap it ap
__label__False i think it s hard to record those
__label__False ok i i remind that me my first objective eh in the project is to to study difference parameter to to find a a good solution to detect eh the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded
__label__False uh they re having tea out there so i guess the other thing that we were gon na talk about is is uh demo
__label__False using this new new um plan ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False they should come when they re done their stuff basically whenever that is
__label__False so um a fair amount of
__label__False hmm
__label__False is it considered to be like in are they considered to be like very uh sort of s abstract thing
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False or the winner is infoon
__label__False yes yes
__label__False yeah yeah right
__label__False and
__label__False hmm
__label__False i m i m somewhat more hopeful for it
__label__False um
__label__False a range of microphone
__label__False but i do nt think i i am capable of of do pulling this off and doing justice to the matter
__label__False we can definitely do that so t so one question is are there good place in the file where we can really do that
__label__False we do nt have to hand transcribe the digit because we re reading them and i have those
__label__False aaaaaaaaa ok that s me
__label__False so if we used another method to get the first pas i think it would probably work it s a good method
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False like like
__label__False more there s going to be the just four computational linguist by coincidence but the rest is whatever biocomputing people and physicist
__label__False actually i i uh forgot to say that the multilingual net are trained on uh feature without the s derivative uh but with increased frame number mmm
__label__False see what he think would work best with them
__label__False well yeah except the variance wa big right
__label__False yeah w we d need to prune
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False o one zero two six three five three one one four five seven two seven zero one three four five seven one nine o o eight one o nine eight zero seven six zero eight
__label__False so those are all thing that should be there so far um uh jose ha ha been
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah actually something that s close to cepstral mean subtraction
__label__False yeah it wa specifically on the meeting
__label__False nnn
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you mean so actually put put the wavefile in with beep in it
__label__False and i do nt know if um where that i if that s something that we wan na do with each meeting sort of like a um it s like a manifest when you get a box full of stuff or or if that s um
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False n um not not not much is new so when i talked about what i m planning to do last time
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s true i guess yeah so in a way you would have that
__label__False it s this thing s this is too big for my head
__label__False the big one take a while yeah that take two three week
__label__False so i wi th
__label__True uh the original paper say that only one gaussian for the noise
__label__False uh yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__True file and directory
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh uh from zero to two two thousand hertz
__label__False a unison digit
__label__False right
__label__False and we can do that with wordcount
__label__False alright
__label__False your stuff is all ready so it s just a question of did morgan get around to testing it
__label__False oh
__label__False well we have about thirtytwo hour uh a of
__label__False right
__label__False well in that case we ca nt we ca nt w if if well the thing is if that s the case we our i do nt think our system can handle that currently
__label__False where s the case
__label__False and some people have claimed that they got some better performance doing that so you certainly could do that easily
__label__False five nine three five seven five six zero
__label__False no they actually changed the compression scheme altogether
__label__False right
__label__False i think that the h i mean nothing beat the the admission charge price in japan
__label__False i do nt know i i just that could be seen from the tidigits uh testing condition because um the noise are from the tidigits right noise
__label__False why doe smartkom need a network
__label__False oh in the presentation here i wa ac actually worried about bibtex uh no that s quite possible
__label__False yeah
__label__False middle or end
__label__False this this maybe brings up another topic which is um
__label__False ok mmhmm
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False you this is our reward if we do our digi
__label__False yeah that s right
__label__False the other thing is it is in java so
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah but then i m not sure that s the right thing for u
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False ok
__label__False digit recitation task
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False slightly better
__label__False cool
__label__False hunh
__label__False yeah
__label__False well that s good i think that after all of this uh um confusion settle down in another some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it ll get out there and hopefully it ll have some effect from something that that ha uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it doe nt there s there s go there ll be standard after that
__label__False stephane had
__label__False ok wonderful
__label__False yep
__label__False why would it be cool
__label__False sorry
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and the other three feature are r the variance of the difference between the two spectrum the variance of the autocorrelation function except the the first point because half the height value is rzero and also rzero the first coefficient of the autocorrelation function that is like the energy with these three feature also these three feature
__label__False yeah see that that bother me that they re the same thing
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False and if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly backup
__label__False so then you re so and then you re expected to backchannel because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody
__label__False four zero five six four three three four
__label__False no
__label__False yeah
__label__False no actually it s interesting so it s
__label__False i m currently retraining another set of model where it s both in the training and the test and then we ll we ll have hopefully even better result so
__label__False transcript l dash three zero seven
__label__False i i i guess you are using finally this the scheme which they
__label__False or excuse me cut it by sixtytwo percent
__label__False so
__label__False one could argue what if there are basic case even
__label__True so only a couple of agenda item since no one sent me email for agenda item uh the first is the ibm transcript i d like to uh mention i s i spoke with several of you about this but just to brainstorm a little bit about what we can do with it
__label__False yeah i do yeah yeah so by putting this noise
__label__False but um i do nt think we know for sure
__label__False no we have a separate feature
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and um
__label__False the way we absolutely have those mean that are even part of the mthreel a api meaning we can reference so meaning
__label__False right yeah
__label__False you should probably move the microphone closer to your face
__label__False yeah
__label__False relative
__label__False no
__label__False so let s see i want to query right the mode
__label__False uh yeah i think that ll be once we get it populated that ll be a nice machine i mean we will ultimately get eight processor in there
__label__False ok
__label__False right so i ve i ve already created a u u doctor speech data mr directory or had jane do it and uh um but there s not a lot of free space around
__label__False yeah i think they pi p yeah they picked the value from
__label__False you e you have eh you are lucky and you you find a solution in in in some few tim uh month eh
__label__False cool
__label__False so if they include the delta it will be an additional forty millisecond
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False one curve s for the closetalking microphone which is the lower curve and the other one is for the distant microphone which ha more noise so it s logical that it performs worse so a i wa saying the miss rate is quite important uh which mean that we tend to label speech a a a silence
__label__False oh it s it s zero at twenty hertz right the filter
__label__False right i mean so th th th the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that i had already done for other reason
__label__False why
__label__False so um i have to convert the uh transcript into this format and then the scoring program actually look at the time and uh you know it you can have a different segmentation in your recognizer output than in your reference and it will still do the right thing
__label__False i get it
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False view and approach will not be there
__label__False it d be nice if we can do like a quick hack just so we can play the audio file too
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah versus the sony
__label__False ok so uh
__label__False he s he s sort of back but he drove for fourteen hour an and wa nt gon na make it in today
__label__False thanks
__label__False and perhaps the noise are quite different from the noise in the speech that italian
__label__False now wait are are we doing them simultaneously or one at a time alright
__label__False and then it s uh
__label__False you re shifting the feature space yeah
__label__True yeah i i thought morgan you brought it up a couple meeting ago and then it wa something about uh some and then somebody said yeah it doe seem like you know czero is the one that s you know the major one or uh s i ca nt remember exactly what it wa now
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False so you guy are using lda but it seems like it s pretty far back in the process
__label__False eh i mean the uh the uh the bic criterion the the t to train the the gaussian eh using the the mark eh by hand eh eh to distinguish be mmm to train overlapping zone and speech zone i mean eh i i i think that an interesting eh experiment eh could be th eh to prove that mmm if s we suppose that eh the the first step
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False um
__label__False because i we re we re dealing with the uh in the early meeting we re recording while we re saying who s talking on what microphone and thing like that and that seems to be a lot of overlap
__label__False ratio
__label__False yeah we re gon na get a replacement server that ll be a faster server actually that ll be it s a seven hundred fifty megahertz uh sun uh
__label__False so um
__label__False so i mean again if you trained in one kind of noise and tested in the same kind of noise you d you know given enough training data you do nt do b do badly
__label__False um
__label__False uh and this is all in one file that s continuous
__label__False yeah
__label__False but it s it s unfortunately this is not really something a tourist would ever say
__label__False yeah
__label__False some of th some of them yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i mean i do nt wan na fool them
__label__False good
__label__False so you know i i could argue strongly that something like the medium mismatch which is you know not compl pathological but i mean what wa the the mediummismatch condition again
__label__False right
__label__False and uh we ll see if we get any response
__label__False yeah i mean we we know that there s noise
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False um uh the uh the there were two system that were put forth by a combination of of uh french telecom and alcatel
__label__False oh i see you may have a task wh you have to go get money and so you are doing business at that stage
__label__False we probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker but i guess andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker and that s actually a little bit of a f funky model like it give you some weird alignment just because often the background speaker match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker so there s some thing there especially when you get lot of the same word uh occurring in the
__label__False huh
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False yep
__label__False yeah cuz they can still check out full copy and make whatever change they want to their local copy
__label__False yeah which is not really noise actually it s just adding a constant to each of the mel uh energy
__label__False and then those action can be in multiple category at the same time if necessary
__label__False only on yeah
__label__False ca nt you use different var different level of activation across uh lot of different neuron to specify different value
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False what is the c code can w can we see that
__label__False do we have a i m sorry for interrupting do we have an edu meeting at four
__label__False so yes stephane also ha the same experience of using the spectral subtraction right
__label__False yeah
__label__False y yeah if if you take log x into log one plus n by x and then expand the log one plus n by x into taylor series
__label__False and then after subtraction um i add a constant to the energy and
__label__False and and then we train from scratch so we com we do a you know w um
__label__False ok um
__label__False well the example i wa thinking of also wa this w thing that that herve and and hynek and i made about uh increasing the error rate
__label__False so that would last u for a while
__label__False it s not that they say one word and then there s a bunch of word together
__label__False nine nine zero seven three nine two six
__label__False a popular disco is the young ganz
__label__False hmm
__label__False well this is u we ll have a fair amount of annoyance yeah i think uh
__label__False like i know the whole thing is like intention lattice or something like that right so is the ri right now are the idea the rich rich the rad or whatever is one you know potential block inside intention it s still it s still mainly intention hypothesis and then that s just one way to describe the the action part of it ok
__label__False ok
__label__False actually
__label__False well the the sort of the landmark is is sort of the object right the argument in a sense
__label__False oh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah the the biggest issue is the stupid cable that sony
__label__False well i think our intention at this point is when we re not using it to record a meeting we ll coil them all up and put them under so that people will not be tripping over them and so on
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False how many meeting is that like how many t ten it s like ten meeting or something
__label__False at present um the people have been doing these transcription a channel at a time
__label__False so so how about putting them on that plus like on a on on dat or some other medium that is nt risky
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah that s the first one i think the very very first one
__label__False and then you use those adapted model which are not speaker adapted but sort of acous you know channel adapted use that a the starting model for your speaker adaptation
__label__False oh
__label__False wa this done
__label__False which is part of why it s used
__label__False what why
__label__False correct
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False mmm mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh
__label__False so anyway that s that s uh that s another whole direction that cou could be looked at
__label__False yeah
__label__False well what i m thinking is
__label__False yeah it wa only gaussian
__label__False well u not sure
__label__False transcript l dash two zero five two two six five two one four four eight five five three one seven seven zero six five three two five five one eight five three seven three five one one six six six eight seven five five zero four one seven four three two one seven six eight zero seven seven five two eight nine zero two seven six seven five zero one three three five six three seven eight five three six nine seven six
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False i decided to talk about that
__label__False right well or i m hoping
__label__False yeah i mean the reference one for instance this is back old on uh on italian uh wa like six percent error for the wellmatched and eighteen for the mediummatched and sixty for the for highlymismatched
__label__False yep
__label__False ok
__label__False no
__label__False it f it clip over your ear there you go
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False no r c no
__label__False a or ge get a first pas from those and then go through sort of it d be a lot faster probably to
__label__False right
__label__False you you re not booting from initial model you re booting from initial alignment
__label__False it is against my head
__label__False we re done
__label__False ok
__label__False i kind of thought of doing business a more of running an errand type thing
__label__False cuz i do nt have to implement anything
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh but other than that you re you re basically done right
__label__False ok
__label__False oh ok so we just have to c wander around and collect them up
__label__False don don ha had he know he can just read it like a play
__label__False so
__label__False that s right
__label__False yeah
__label__False but i think right now again the idea is doing just very simple thing how much better can you make it and um since they re only simple thing there s nothing that you re gon na do that is going to blow up the amount of computation um so if you found that nine wa better than six that would be o k i think actually
__label__False plps so
__label__False right
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i think this wa
__label__False yeah
__label__False no not at all but
__label__False well it s it sound
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um so one thing is that i did look on sony s for a replacement for the mike for the head m headworn one cuz they re so uncomfortable
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s mostly higher level
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False right ok that s a good point
__label__False um the yeah for the plp with jrasta the the we
__label__False yeah
__label__False but i guess what s confusing me is if we have a bayesnet to deal w another bayesnet to deal with this stuff you know uh is the only reason ok so
__label__False well
__label__False the problem with doing it live is it take so long to load that um
__label__True well did you ask lila cuz i bet she ha this information
__label__False um i d expect like there should be seventyfive overlap did you find uh more than seventyfive overlap in that period or
__label__False and the second question might be given that you have good boundary could you do better if you used more parameter to characterize the noise
__label__False in order to get there take bus number fortytwo towards the and exit at the birdband
__label__False an and i would like to second keith s request an example wo would be nice t to have kind of a detailed example
__label__False oh
__label__False how
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i wa looking i ve been studying and going through the log for the system that um andreas created
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but i think maybe we should have a a submeeting
__label__False so where is this huge project
__label__False how m how much bigger is it
__label__False and then it right
__label__False oh
__label__False exactly
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh let s see so the the the feature vector are calculated every ten millisecond so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz uh
__label__False well you th
__label__False there s a we re pausing for a photo
__label__False um so there is a f a first feature stream that use uh straight
__label__False yeah it is
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False u uh may
__label__False seems like you should be able to spawn that off into a background process because not everything is displayed in that tree at once right
__label__False like nontouristy landmark and direct navigational yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh no actually get we need another box because each each box in the back room can only take six
__label__False right
__label__False and they burn new one every once in a while but if you go if you go k
__label__False well yeah just out of the other three though that you had in the those three node the d they did nt seem like they were mutually exclusive
__label__False we should at least ask um
__label__False th that s that s true
__label__False so forty cleaning
__label__False um the uh
__label__False really
__label__False so then our next idea wa to add a middle layer right
__label__False and then there would be backchannels but it would be the person who asked the question other people were nt really doing much backchanneling
__label__False but what if it s not an action
__label__False when
__label__False that s just what i wa thinking
__label__False uh ok so
__label__False what wa wa this number forty or it wa roughly the same a this one he said when you had the two language versus the three language
__label__False i mean that s sort of what the way i had imagined would happen is that on the other side yeah you p put some low level noise or something
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False not a i m not saying there s not a farfield microphone uh application but
__label__False between you guy uh ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False no he said he tried that but he did nt like it because it uh it took it out of the um presentation mode
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh it doe nt have it doe nt have any temporal uh i thought it
__label__False oh that s a good point
__label__False all the other one were five percent the
__label__False ok
__label__False so so that s that s sort of what it is
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False very simple
__label__False whether it ll work or not yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok so this is february second eh two thousand this is eh meeting number one with adam and dan and morgan about five oclock uh in the afternoon
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False i mean i think i think we ve raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it but the
__label__False beep one thousand three hundred fortytwo
__label__False well
__label__False so they ve just trained up a net which ha two output i believe
__label__False but eh what did you think about the possibility of using the javier software
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False and that
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh a a model
__label__False mississippi state recognizer
__label__False yeah
__label__False yes uh i would really p it would be better if i talked about it on friday
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh my gosh
__label__False but the baseline mel cepstrum under those training doe nt do a well
__label__False yeah
__label__False including a lot of uh backchannels so when you re d running thing if you run it on the old
__label__False doe seem to me that it that it carry over some baggage with it that uh i that i can understand it in context a you described it
__label__False that feed into those
__label__False and then so the only reason way we would know what question he s asking is based upon oh so if let s say i had a construction parser and i plug this in i would know what each construction the communicative intent of the construction wa and so then i would know how to weight the node appropriately in response
__label__False yeah i do
__label__False but for s for scoring you can do it or not do it a you choose so
__label__False doe it have nice wall
__label__False but i guess perhaps
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh that
__label__False ugh
__label__False um
__label__False yeah that make sense
__label__False uh let s see uh
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False no it doe not the cv doe nt work that way
__label__False absolutely
__label__False one three one zero five seven six eight one two
__label__False seat
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False right
__label__False i i think it s it s fast because uh
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False wait a minute some of this is uh is uh is in parallel is nt it i mean the lda
__label__False yeah i mean it s a different style but i think that s alright
__label__False so uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we interviewed fey
__label__False i i think they re trying to understand um what s good about neural net in in term of you know their pattern of error and
__label__False but it s but of course that one s weighted lower so i wonder what the net effect is
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False yep
__label__False right cuz you have nt done any training
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah it doe nt matter what those node are anyway because we ll just make the weight zero for now
__label__True you have class until two right so if we do nt want him if we do nt want him to run over here two thirtyish or three is
__label__False right because the whole point is that it s extracting pie par part that are loud anyway
__label__False so that s good
__label__False no no
__label__False auroratwo
__label__False nice
__label__False yeah
__label__False um
__label__False oh i see
__label__True uh i mean for instance the the thing i wa arguing for before but again which i do nt think we have time to try is something in which you would modify the code so you could train to have several output on and use articulatory feature cuz then that would that would go that would be much broader and cover many different situation
__label__False problem is if you are going to run this on different m test set including large vocabulary um
__label__False and if you had if you had fifty filter you d be throwing away hardly anything
__label__False so yeah so about a about an eight percent uh seven or eight percent relative
__label__False yeah but this i
__label__False uh
__label__False oh ok
__label__False so that you know for example uh in the metaphor case that you have a kind of direct idea of a source path and goal and any metaphorical one and abstract goal and all that sort of stuff you can do the same grammar
__label__False u i m i m confused uh is is this downloading something that happens once
__label__False but i it it so it look like they did some some uh reasonable thing uh and they re not thing that we did precisely
__label__False transcript l fiftyfive or transcript l five five
__label__False matlab went to these like um you can have cell and you can you can uh implement objectoriented type thing with matlab
__label__False and um
__label__False these are log energy computed from the time s domain signal not from the mel filter bank
__label__False right but the question is whether sixtyfour hertz is is uh too uh low
__label__False ok
__label__False i think so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False there s nothing that say you know
__label__False o zero one zero two nine seven nine nine three one two eight seven four four four six six five three six eight seven seven o five two eight nine zero zero three one two two seven one three eight o five five o three four five six o nine o eight two four o one seven eight nine two o four six
__label__False well i it you know
__label__False eight seven two nine seven zero one five
__label__False yeah
__label__False right so it s taking sample it s doing adaptation it s adjusting weight and then it s getting the sum
__label__False yep
__label__False so five frame that s twenty
__label__False um
__label__False so there s not a statistical sta a strong st statistically different noise characteristic between uh the training and test and yet we re seeing some kind of effect
__label__False ok well
__label__False so there s a lot of thing to work with
__label__False because i i am finding that um in double checking i ve run across u um one data set where the microphone wa off early on and then two other speaker their microphone went off later
__label__False uh and uh i do nt know
__label__False right yeah
__label__False uh probably the neural net cuz it s probably it it s it s um
__label__False yeah i know but the bayesnet would be able to the weight on the on the node in the bayesnet would be able to do all that would nt it
__label__False it s trained on uh a lot of switchboard call home um a bunch of different source some digit there s some digit training in there
__label__False yeah it s the same
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah i thi i think to the wrong audience i agree that um p to the wrong audie we should just explain what it what it mean here and that it s a common term and we re
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False i i um
__label__False two seven six zero five six five eight six seven
__label__False i have extracted these
__label__False good point
__label__False yeah and th the the other thing is i m not po i m sort of thinking a we ve been through this a few time that i really do nt know maybe you wan na do it once for the novelty but i do nt know if in general we wan na have meeting that we record from outside this group do the digit
__label__False you could try an experiment and say ok i m about to test for spike and then wiggle the thing there and then go and when they go to transcribe it it could ask them to come and get you come get me when you transcribe this and see if there s spike
__label__False it s
__label__False that would help get them synchronized
__label__False yep
__label__False so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False in hebrew it mean
__label__False yeah the seat number have fallen off here
__label__False three seven six two six three six seven two nine four two
__label__False yeah it s so we have to like fit the probability
__label__False because the output is always gon na be all the decision node and all the the a all the posterior probability for all the value
__label__True um yeah we actually talked about this in the uh frontend meeting this morning too
__label__False yeah
__label__False i i i i ve
__label__False and pu and have a beep model
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah i will try to explain the thing that i did this this week during this week
__label__False go there now
__label__False and so you extract the individual channel uh one sp spurt by spurt a it were
__label__False well usually i mean you know n
__label__False and so uh there s the question
__label__False those were nonbackedup
__label__False i i will be at spain to you help uh
__label__False transcript l two hundred and one eight seven one one three five five eight one eight six two four five zero one six two two four two three eight one four six four one nine two six nine one four nine eight six two two nine one two nine two six two one two five nine zero two one four three five seven nine four eight seven five zero eight three six nine six three five seven three four two eight six one eight
__label__False oh
__label__False big list
__label__False yeah so we start with that different proto and it becomes eightyeight which is like some fifty percent improvement
__label__False yeah
__label__False how long doe it take carmen to train up one of these net
__label__False it ll beep onto onto the tape too
__label__False um so briefly i m proposing to do a n a new p approach to speech recognition using um a combination of uh multiband idea and idea um about the uh acoustic phonec phonetic approach to speech recognition
__label__False gothere is no
__label__False right
__label__False right and that xml document will say
__label__False yeah i did nt actually see who they all were
__label__False ok
__label__False cuz uh the switchboard transcription project uh uh you know wa half a dozen people or so working off and on over a couple year and uh similar similar amount of data to what you re talking about with timit training so it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is uh to automatically translate the uh current timit marking into the marking you want
__label__False yeah
__label__False maybe this you know ha some kind of um funky thing that di if this and this may influence these hidden node of the discourse which is maybe something that is uh a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe so thing that point towards
__label__False yeah
__label__False just talk more
__label__False so there wa a there wa a little bit of a a a a difference of opinion because i i thought that it wa it s interesting to look at what feature are useful
__label__False lda filter
__label__False just just take a minute
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ah
__label__False so this is still at three or four percent improvement over the first proposal
__label__False what doe it look like for unvoiced
__label__False yeah u
__label__False yeah
__label__False um and then it doe a median filter and then it look for run
__label__False six eight six nine three two nine two three
__label__False um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uhhuh yeah
__label__False it s off
__label__False lda aspect but th a far a the orthogonalizing transformation you were trying that at one point right
__label__False right
__label__False oh did you do that
__label__False right
__label__False yeah so
__label__False oops
__label__False oh yeah sure yeah sure sure sure sure because i i need a lot of time to to put the label or to do that yeah
__label__False and and but i mean this if this is a better interface for making these kind of uh you know lo clos local change then that d be fine too i do nt i have no idea i think this is something that would need to be checked
__label__False i am sm i am smarticus is what it s saying i gue
__label__False ok
__label__False i mean they re ok i i do nt i do nt think they were earth earth shattering but i think that uh this wa a couple year ago i remember them doing it at some meeting and and um
__label__False yeah it s it s prepared
__label__False what worked best is the handlabeled data
__label__False see because you re gon you re uh really you re gon na end up with all these little patchy thing whereas really what we want to do is have the the the bias towards letting it go
__label__False right but i mean if we if we want jerry s group to use it then we probably wo nt ask them to read any number right cuz
__label__False here
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False well we ve got we ve got right now we could have two more people on wireless with a trip to leo s audio we could get a third extra person on wireless and uh right now we could have three more three more people wearing mike like this and that would just work i mean i m not sure how how good the quality is on this mike but i think it s going to be ok
__label__False these action i do nt know if i m gon na answer your question or not with this but the category inside of action schema so spg action is a category
__label__False so the only the only uh hesitation i had about it since i mean i have nt see the data is it sound like it s it s continuous variable and a bunch of them
__label__False ok
__label__False so you you end up with a vector that s the same length a the fft vector and then you just uh compute difference and uh sum the difference
__label__False oh yeah
__label__False try to create a paper out of that
__label__False yeah
__label__False and i do nt know how far or if you guy even had a chance to try that but that would be some it d be interesting to me
__label__False yeah
__label__False intrinsic yeah
__label__False and this is
__label__False fill it out
__label__False um
__label__False well
__label__False hmm
__label__False zero three five seven two six zero six five nine
__label__False well i mean the fact that it s inconsistent is an obvious mistake but the but um the other thing i do nt know i have nt thought it through but one one would think that each it it s like if you say what s the what s the best way to do an average an arithmetic average or a geometric average
__label__False i mean the other thing i wonder about wa whether there wa something just in the the bootstrapping of their system which wa based on but maybe not since they
__label__False so if you wanted to study people overlapping people that s not a problem
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__False oh do you
__label__False um yeah well
__label__False so
__label__False no this is the signal this is the signal
__label__False ju
__label__False yeah
__label__False so again it s around fiftysix fiftyseven uh
__label__False now i have to i have to i really need to uh raise a question about the term cheating ok
__label__False it s a lot more believable too if you tell them that they re the computer part is running on a window machine
__label__False what today s the twentyfirst oh man
__label__False what where wa the um the smallest latency of all the system last time
__label__False well mmm
__label__False then this category would we would put it or not necessarily we would put a new action in the m uh in the category that in which it ha the um well every action ha a set of related schema like sourcepathgoal or force whatever right
__label__False so wa the training set same a the p the february proposal
__label__False and there s a lot of different meeting at uw uh
__label__False or they might be more likely to be using the place that they want to go to a a like a navigational point to go to another place
__label__False yeah
__label__False i have but not transcontinentally
__label__False no no i i remember that
__label__False yeah it say what it is but i do nt how that s different from
__label__False no we have s we do nt we have our own something wi th that doe nt that is nt used by the backup gang
__label__False not indirectly but you actually can feel the tip and people who are uh accomplished violinist and stuff like that claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of physical sensation of the end affector
__label__False and so they ve picked the value oh ok ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s it s um
__label__False and then um the other thing is i believe that i did hand
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok
__label__False that s true
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False or what is the situation type
__label__False w we we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignment by looking at them first and then realizing the kind of error that were occurring and um some of the error occurring very frequently are just thing like the first word being moved to a early a possible in the recognition which is a um
__label__False and and this this curve are the average over the whole database so
__label__False and any rate
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False ok how about you sunil
__label__False well there actually the i what would have been really nice is to find an example for all of this uh from our domain
__label__False the log the taylor series expansion for log one plus n by x is
__label__False but well we could probably put the delta um before online normalization it should not that make a big difference because
__label__False oh
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False how should that be done i mean it it seems like there s a simple way
__label__False and and then uh yeah so
__label__False then having the data is very valuable cuz i think it s um politically better for u to say we have this many hour of audio data especially with the itr if we put in a proposal on it it ll just look like icsi s collected a lot more audio data um whether it s transcribed or not um is another issue but there s there are research question you can answer without the transcription or at least that you can start to answer
__label__False er everybody
__label__False no because the transcription company doe what they do
__label__False right
__label__False i mean
__label__False but it call rasta with some option and um
__label__False yeah
__label__False here
__label__False well but what i m saying is that i ca nt just email them the password because that s not secure
__label__False uh why they chose sixty four and something else that wa probably just experimental
__label__False and let th
__label__False oh good
__label__False um let s see i guess i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh recording transcription you know basically you know where we are on the corpus
__label__False it may well have been partially that you know because they tried it and then they would have to listen to the tape and find out where it bleep and go forward in the file et cetera et cetera but uh it just seems like it s not hard for u to do and that would just make thing go faster
__label__False i mean this new system is is is better because it ha um this sixtyfour hertz cutoff uh clean downsampling and um what else
__label__False sh
__label__False i just do nt know enough about linux how hard is it to repartition
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False cuz you can automatically pretty much merge thing if you ve only got twenty word or so in an utterance it s when you get the whole meeting and the synch time ch have changed or you ca nt correspond to a previous version with synch time that you get in trouble
__label__False in that way i
__label__False channel three alright
__label__False twentythree
__label__False well why do nt you have this have a this conversation with dave johnson tha rather than with me
__label__False well the other thing is that you just picked one particular way of doing it uh i mean first place it s fifteen db uh down across the utterance and maybe you d want to have something that wa a little more adaptive secondly you happened to pick fifteen db and maybe twenty d be better or or twelve
__label__False o six five zero four four three six five nine one nine five two
__label__False it is useful to transcribe and then ultimately train model for thing like breath and also laughter is very very frequent and important to to model
__label__False which uh you know is a pretty low frequency kind of thing but but uh
__label__False alright
__label__False well if you ha since you have to um go over the transcript later anyway you could make it one of the job of the people who do that to mark u
__label__False um yes one more future work i think every presentation have a should have a future work slide
__label__False yeah so i think initially we should take up more space until we ve analyzed this and get a better sense of it because uh we don i mean we re not talking about forty or fifty hour at this point we re talking about a half hour of of speech and so uh we should look at this carefully but
__label__False it s a pretty nice place in my brief uh encounter with it
__label__False you could define other event a being sequence of these event too
__label__False one time i saw a report on train and i think there is a l
__label__False it should not make
__label__False yeah
__label__False rad like every time i say it it s horrible
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and that might do
__label__False right
__label__False the
__label__False right and then
__label__False nine
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False and we re on
__label__False yeah
__label__False four o eight four three o five two one one
__label__False so i m kind of investigated to see what wa the main factor for this difference and it seems that the lda filter is is wa hurting
__label__False from end to en like from the beginning of the process to the end of the process
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and it wa giving s slightly better result
__label__False well i believe the effect that of of too reducing too much the information is basically basically what happens and but
__label__False i ll either create a subdirectory for like if it s meeting recorder project or hubfive or whatever so we c i just have to create those subdirectory and
__label__False i mean so if someone want to use that data
__label__False because it would now have to like uh take that possibility into account
__label__False yeah
__label__False u u u u uh i meant you know this end of the world yeah is really what i meant uh cuz he s been in europe
__label__False the the transcription by jane t eh i eh
__label__False well i think it s also they are much le likely to d have error
__label__False the manufacturer
__label__False but maybe you should you know consider more using more data or i mean
__label__False we yeah so the syntax tree are very simple it s like most of the sentence in one tree and instead of you know breaking down to like small unit and building back up they basically took the sentence and basically cut them in half or you know into third or something like that and made tree out of those
__label__False yeah
__label__False and uh so we
__label__False yeah it s yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False which is probably true
__label__False i came out at the gig an hour at one point that that s one computation i did for sixteen channel sixteen bit
__label__False and um
__label__False if not we can move on
__label__False mmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False and it wa basically we re s we re keeping it on the safe side but you re d right it might be that one more iteration would would help but it s sort of you know
__label__False no it doe nt actually
__label__False one eight three nine zero one four five three six two nine
__label__False you you can actually say thing like um
__label__False good ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False and um
__label__False i guess yeah i guess we do nt need their signature i guess an email ok is alright
__label__False this is three
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False that s not a bad idea
__label__False well maybe we should get it and if it s good enough we ll arrange window machine to be available
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uh we
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh you ve you ve got one
__label__False ok
__label__False and i hope the the next week i will have eh some result and we we will show we will see eh the the parameter the pitch eh tracking in with the program
__label__False b
__label__False well that s interesting
__label__False do uh d d
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False hmm
__label__False um oh by the way i did find a bunch uh we should count out how many more digit to form do we have back there
__label__False currently
__label__False sort of having an actively antagonistic uh
__label__False oh yes
__label__False yeah
__label__False so i m gon na go up to twenty hour be sure that everything get processed and released and and that s that s what my goal is package of twenty hour right now and then once that s done move on to the next
__label__False so maybe for that one you need a much smarter vad
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh and when they had the reverberation here uh we ll measure the signaltonoise ratio and it s uh about nine db
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah between now and then
__label__False or a number beep
__label__False well you you can right i mean y you you it stretch again for single frame i think it would be pretty hard but if you say speech start here speech end there right
__label__False inexpensive
__label__False well
__label__False yeah
__label__False the same thing on the wall you give them a laser where is it they do it give them a stick long stick and say do it they ca nt do it
__label__False yeah
__label__False not in scotland
__label__False right
__label__False seven nine one one two six five four two
__label__False no
__label__False ah
__label__False a what
__label__False uh no it s it s just the gain that s smoothed actually but it s smoothed
__label__False maybe we could do it from a w a pc or something
__label__False you can but they never will be able to read them
__label__False individual channel
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False i
__label__False right and that s what you seem to be saying
__label__False or
__label__False and um the i tried that with hdk the aurora setup of hdk training on clean tidigits and um it it helped um in a phony reverberation case um where i just used the simulated impulse response um the error rate went from something like eighty it wa from something like eighteen percent to um four percent
__label__False channel two
__label__False but even without that the backup system is becoming saturated
__label__False oh you have the lda a part of the vd uh vad or
__label__False i think it will get worse because
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False i actually have to run
__label__False so you recognize a phone and which ever phone wa recognized you spit out it s vector of one and zero
__label__False two o six eight eight seven three eight five
__label__False well it d be hard but on the other hand a you point out if your if i if if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people people s speech you will you will get that somewhat better um
__label__False so slightly biased toward tango ing
__label__False i mean you know basically he s he just study he s a colleague a friend and uh they and and you know the the organization always did wan na help u it wa just a question of getting you know the right people connected in who had the time so um eh
__label__False ok good
__label__False sure
__label__False yeah
__label__False he want to know something about the history of so he said
__label__False o zero
__label__False so um what s do you think we uh should do the digit or skip it or what are what do you think
__label__False so
__label__False fft analysis frame stepped by a half second so it s a quarter length step and i
__label__True um but but yeah i thin i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the sony uh radiomikes
__label__False ok but th
__label__False short meeting
__label__False um i think in about um a little le than two week
__label__False oh you mean for location
__label__False hmm
__label__False well actually you do nt even need to do that with xml d ca nt you just look at one specific
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False um if you re getting fiftysix percent over here uh that s in noise also right
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False much the same thing and and it wa uh i mean there the point of interest to the group wa primarily that um the uh the system that we had that wa based on ht k that s used by you know all the participant in aurora wa so much worse than the than the sr i and the interesting thing is that even though yes it s a digit task and that s a relatively small number of word and there s a bunch of digit that you train on it s just not a good a having a a l very large amount of data and training up a a a nice good big
__label__False well i when uh just f u the data that i ve looked at so far that rec i mean there s ton of case for polysemy
__label__False i mean ignore all the detail and all the way which is that these are complete lie
__label__False transcript l four four
__label__False um yeah u um
__label__False so i guess the next thing is this uh bleep editing
__label__False yeah
__label__False you get someone with a with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance thing so the s typical task is subdivision so there s a a line on the wall over there and you give them a laser pointer and you say
__label__False so by the way tha that structure that robert drew on the board wa like more um cuetypebased right here s like we re gon na segment off a bit of stuff that come from discourse and then some of the thing we re talking about here are more you know we mentioned maybe if they talk about um i do nt know entering or som you know like they might be more taskbased
__label__False right
__label__False um
__label__False we re all entitled to our opinion here
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False this only that
__label__False and you have more than one mike
__label__False and it wa surprising
__label__False well there i thought or there wa a paper on it huh
__label__False right
__label__False um
__label__False no wait not necessarily is it
__label__False transcript l one one seven seven five eight five one three o seven one four two six nine four five six two three seven o four four seven five one three seven four eight o one five six six two seven five three seven six eight o six nine seven six one four two one three nine eight five two three one o eight eight four four four two nine five four six one one o three two two four
__label__False were shortened yeah
__label__False so it s throwing out frame and the thing is um what i do nt understand is how they re doing this with ht k
__label__False giving it to them ok
__label__False um but uh
__label__False i mean i it would nt be perfect but but it doe seem more natural to give a backchannel when when you re somehow involved in the topic and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question
__label__False but um uh certainly a lot of the noise uh is uh below a hundred hertz uh the signaltonoise ratio you know look a fair amount better if you if you highpass filter it from this room
__label__False the the the log of x plus n is not the same a the log of e to the x plus e to the n
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so let s see we
__label__False i have nt gotten back to that recently but
__label__False uh so um i ve give i ve given her some thing to read
__label__False um so i will be using these graphical model that um that implement the multiband approach to recognize a set of intermediate category that might involve uh thing like phonetic feature or other other f feature thing that are more closely related to the acoustic signal itself
__label__False yeah
__label__False then you can do your first pas without any subtraction at all
__label__False that put all the value to zero or one and then the median filtering
__label__False that you know they do mri and and if you re uh got something within reach then there s one of your area light up and if something s out of reach uh a different one
__label__False on the channel channel
__label__False you first look o at the lowball one and then
__label__False well we could
__label__False before
__label__False i m pretty sure that you can daisychain them together so what we would do is replace the wired mike with wireless
__label__False right so the so the worst it could be if the others were exactly the same is four and and uh in fact since the others are somewhat better
__label__False i m well rehearsed
__label__False so um
__label__False i mean if that s accurate then that would determine tourist node
__label__False i dunno what the these tape uh at some point these
__label__False so everybody everybody s on yeah
__label__False uh little later on in the year
__label__False and so um uh that one really benefited from the larger set and it wa also a diverse set with different noise and so forth uh so um that uh that seemed to be so if you have that that better recognizer that can that can build up more parameter and if you um have the natural room which in this case ha a p a pretty bad signaltonoise ratio then in that case um the right thing to do is just do u use speaker adaptation
__label__False or is it on fire or something happening to it or is it stable and so forth going all the way um f through parking
__label__False great
__label__False i do nt know
__label__False but i like b i like what liz is saying about
__label__False seven eight seven zero one zero six one five eight
__label__False i m sort of psyching myself out here i i m trying to uh but i i think that s
__label__False oh
__label__False um
__label__False and um it s not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the socalled concept to speech approach so i m i m i m going backwards now so
__label__False um then the other thing is that these pool of transcriber that they re using um sort of are not dedicated to to our project but are in use for all ibm project and ibm ha recently giving given them uh a whole bunch of stuff so it s gon na sort of delay u
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah it s it s an it s an issue right like
__label__False so just add something everywhere rather than just in those place it s just a constant right
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False and off
__label__False yeah
__label__False although if you if you have some parameter like what s a good window size for the median filter
__label__False because uh one of the th one of the fantasy that wa at least fun to talk about wa that uh uh ok maybe you th you re the range of thing you can do with multiple microphone is limited if they re a few inch apart but what if you have two of these thing
__label__False yeah
__label__False baumwelch training
__label__False right
__label__False and um
__label__False yeah bu although i d be i think it d be interesting to just take this exact actual system so that these number were comparable and try it out on tidigits
__label__False right
__label__False well
__label__False but there s
__label__False you know it s a problem with these multiuser system is that lot of process are running and you do nt t really have control
__label__False yeah business on the other hand is uh definitely what you re doing
__label__False chicken on the grill
__label__False hmm
__label__False uh so uh we so a i wa already said we we mainly focused on
__label__False yeah so pzms
__label__False yep
__label__False i should email morgan about it too because he wa asking about that
__label__False that wa all mumbled i think microsoft is
__label__False so th some thing can be landmark in your sense but they can never be entered so for example s a statue
__label__False i ll talk to him
__label__False yeah no i mean the after the noise part the forty the the other hundred and eighty
__label__False eight six two four five eight eight nine two
__label__False yeah or you can run into an old friend or run
__label__False but n th the um tandem feature are u used a they are so yeah maybe we can add some context from these feature also a
__label__False yeah yeah yeah
__label__True wha what wa on the list th the i mean i sent you a couple thing although i do nt remember them
__label__False i recognize that too
__label__False yeah um because then
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False transcript l one two nine zero nine zero zero five three nine two five five six zero three seven seven zero nine eight eight nine zero seven five nine six nine one one eight two six eight seven two five one one four four
__label__False i m curious about looking at you know how these model have trained and looking at the expected duration of the model and i wan na compare that in the the wellmatched case f to the unmatched case and see if you can get an idea of just from looking at the duration of these model you know what what s happening
__label__False when are his prelim
__label__False half
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False oh s so it s sort of automatic derived fr from the structure that that is built elsewhere
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we could we could have the reading group in here yeah
__label__False but it would be useful for the to see what we get with that one so
__label__False so so if you get one uh uh excuse me if you get one off it t everything is off cuz of the alignment right
__label__False uh something wrong perhaps in the just in the the fact that the label are well
__label__False and the week after that i wo nt
__label__False and uh binary decision about phoneme nnn
__label__False thilo wanted to use the recognizer alignment to train up his um speech detector
__label__False it s kind of done in i mean some of the thing are not in parallel but certainly it would be in parallel with the with a tandem net
__label__False transcript two zero three one dash two zero five zero zero two one two o two six six three two seven three four nine seven nine o five six o o two eight one two nine four seven nine one six five
__label__False right but the other one the final destination the whether they re doing business whether they re in a hurry and whether they re tourist that kind of thing is all uh sort of you know probabilistically depends on the other thing yeah
__label__False it it s not very fancy it s just a
__label__False doe it actually help to distinguish between those two case though
__label__False i mean it s
__label__False um
__label__False yeah mmhmm
__label__False and so i my feeling is going out and buying a few more mike is fine
__label__False oh
__label__False well uh i m giving a talk on july sixteenth it s a mon monday in four week
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False right because
__label__False cheating is a term which is used to apply for basically what all of linguistics corpus linguistics doe and what what my transcriber are doing and what i do which is a methodology whereby you actually physically mark thing in the data like the transcription like the word that are actually there
__label__False yeah
__label__False i ll get it
__label__False what k u by the way wh what factor of two did you i mean
__label__False i mean from the point of view of of uh reducing the number of bit you have to transmit it s not a bad idea to detect silence anyway
__label__False yeah th that s what i did for for my talk
__label__False well th th the other thing that that that yo that you usually do nt tell your graduate student is that these deadline are actually not that um you know strictly enforced because the because bec b nah i because these the conference organizer actually have an interest in getting lot of submission i mean a a monetary interest so
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and on meeting rec recorder far mike digit mike on channel f it went from um fortyone percent error to eight percent error
__label__False um how how are your
__label__False can you write unread on that
__label__False actually i could just go first come to think of it
__label__False i mean
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False n nobody reported it
__label__False right
__label__False that s that s yeah that s true
__label__False ok
__label__False w i wa just noticing on the on the there s a view meter software view meter and the pzm gain is real low so
__label__False i guess the trick is figuring out you know where it doe nt align
__label__False ok
__label__False i i do nt know enough about it but um
__label__False yeah there s some there s like one over one plus the exponential or something like that
__label__False b
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that s true
__label__False yeah these are thing that we had don so don sort of um propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber so whether it wa like question mark or period or um you know comma and thing like that and we kept the and disfluency dash uh kept those in because we sort of wan na know where those are relative to the spurt overlap sp overlap or
__label__False so uh what s uh
__label__False mmm
__label__False well for the baseline
__label__False and they they did a lot of experiment where th where um they take speech and um e they modify the uh they they they measure the relative importance of having different um portion of the modulation spectrum intact
__label__False i once
__label__False well it s a kind of smoothing but
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh there s been some discussion about whether the work we re doing in that project is gon na be for the kiosk or for the mobile or for both and i think for this kind of discussion it matter
__label__False ok so we uh we did another version of the beep where we separated each beep with a spoken digit
__label__False i think it s th called the crown
__label__False so this is uh basically this is comparing an original version of the signal to a smoothed version of the same signal
__label__True but we re all going to be here on tuesday again
__label__False so
__label__False yeah
__label__False and so i i think it would work fine for detecting overlap
__label__False uh
__label__True when is the evaluation november or something
__label__False so do you know what wa wrong with the online normalization or
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False on an xh uh x x whatever partition yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False they re meeting that are now channelized but they were not from
__label__False i think it is
__label__False s
__label__False yeah you re still talking a forced al
__label__False exactly
__label__False one task is more likely you re in a hurry when you do that kind of s doing business and and le in a hurry when uh you re a tourist
__label__False this wa an actual um subject ah
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s a weighted average
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False or or any good old pink floyd concert
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False and well uh we can say that e
__label__False i have here one example if you if you want see something like that
__label__False yeah i mean usually you have in the training set you have similar condition i mean file length are i guess the same order or in the same size a for test data or are nt they
__label__False right
__label__False right ok i see bec because i so this smartkom task first off it s this tv and movie information system and
__label__False no there s no but
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False so th so this is the o the other approach which is what do we do in the future to try to make this le common but it s still gon na happen
__label__False ok so um i guess we are um gon na do the digit at the end
__label__False well of course it wa a bug but i mean it s it s a but it wa pretty f f it wa pretty funny anyway
__label__False um but uh to tell you the truth i wa nt actually looking at the lda so much when i i wa looking at it i wa mostly thinking about the the vad
__label__False wow
__label__False yeah
__label__False do you really say that
__label__False let s get this uh b clearer
__label__False yeah ok so uh
__label__False yeah
__label__False maybe twelve
__label__False wow we re all so high tech here yet another p powerpoint presentation
__label__False and then you can yeah you you can increase your window whi while you get while you are getting more sample
__label__False i can i can do that but there s no orientation where the
__label__False washington gon na have a demo too or
__label__False i think to some extent they are
__label__False ok great
__label__False mmhmm ok
__label__False well i still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing and and the thing i i have in mind is uh maybe you ll see that the result are not just a little bit worse maybe that they re a lot worse
__label__False whi which is not bad because i mean that there s multiple sen i mean that particular case there s mult there there s a forced side of of that verb a well
__label__False delta at input to net
__label__False and
__label__False yeah
__label__False you do nt wan na do it cuz
__label__False it s right but the problem is the following
__label__False i m going to get a ticket if people do nt eat some
__label__False uh
__label__False and so that s a pretty coarse level of granularity so we might wan na think about doing a meeting recorder user owner for those file and then doing group slightly differently but
__label__False so it s just
__label__False we do nt even have enough channel
__label__False fortunately markham s not a transcriber but um
__label__False i think
__label__False ok right
__label__False but it the some something might sometime and they uh if if it s something that they said they might i i
__label__False so uh i m actually uh thinking of using that also in this uh
__label__False the uh well
__label__False i i think it s nice that a person could check cuz sometimes you know you the word on a on the page come out soun sounding different in term of the social dynamic if they hear it and i realize we should nt emphasize that people you know should nt borrow trouble what it come down to but
__label__False uh so that wa the one thing and the other wa that um
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False we might
__label__False oh
__label__False pentiums that we have
__label__False i just some small block of thing which i needed to put together for the subspace approach and i m in the process of like building up that stuff
__label__False yeah
__label__False well yeah but you ca nt dep
__label__False seven five six zero five three seven three
__label__False so you know this is exactly getting someplace with the intention of entering and looking at picture
__label__False huh
__label__False yeah
__label__False vt i m sor
__label__False yeah
__label__False and uh so the the four or five percent or something is is is quite poor
__label__False you ve got ta s have a saturday overnight right
__label__False ok
__label__False but it s still not quite the same because then it s it s um setting target based on where you would say the sound begin in a particular band
__label__False do nt you have like those those several different category on the board
__label__False ok so percentage increase mean decrease ok
__label__False though the one you have is nt quite
__label__False ok uh for his absentee thesis i think you all know that that you can just in germany almost just send in your thesis
__label__False um either io load or processor load
__label__False oh yes right right
__label__False we started to work with this
__label__False then what have we done so far we had our little bit of um um smartkom stuff that we did um everth
__label__False and send in a a a couple of side query on some dummy center setup program so that it actually work because it s designed for this seevit thing where you have the gestural recognition running with this s siemens virtual touch screen which we do nt have here
__label__False oh
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False uh
__label__False um so there s a little bit of correction but it s definitely not a clean a tidigits
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so you could just could nt you just run a
__label__False no i can i can do the timing node in here too and say ok
__label__False so are do you treat breath and laughter a phonetically or a word model or what
__label__False there are place in germany where it cost two hundred fifty dollar to enter
__label__False oh so then you ll feed those
__label__False well basically it s it s um you you get a distance measure at the end of the day and then that distance measure is is um is translated to a zero or one
__label__True just give a talk in the big room and and so peo people know what s going on when you re ready
__label__False yeah until saturday midnight or something we have
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False but it s it s that s probably not it
__label__False n no but
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh i have to remember i ll think about it and try to remember
__label__False ok
__label__False sure but we still have enough changed that the nightly backup are starting to take too long
__label__False um
__label__False yeah well there s that
__label__False so
__label__False ok
__label__False the other thing that that uh of course what barry wa looking at wa wa just that the near versus far and yeah the adaptation would get th some of that but i think even even if there wa uh only a factor of two or something like i wa saying in the email i think that s that s a big factor so
__label__False right
__label__False yeah
__label__False so maybe it depends on what the software tool are like
__label__False the probability whether the probability of a vista tango or enter
__label__False ok i see
__label__False i say eh that eh eh or this eh only because eh i c i i in my opinion it s necessary to eh to eh to put the transcription on the speech file collected by the objective signal
__label__False um you ca you get um
__label__False so a l
__label__False ok ok
__label__False when eh eh i w i
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False i mean it s not artificially added noise or anything
__label__False great
__label__False but the thing is
__label__False she s a linguist on campus
__label__False like uh i mean
__label__False so one of the thing that we did is adam made a modification to th his script that generates this so you can tell it that you want uh basically uh chunk that are no more than either thirty or fortyfive minute
__label__False because it seems like what you said about the mean of the the voiced and the unvoiced that seemed pretty encouraging right
__label__False um yeah we we ve tried including the full full bank
__label__False ok
__label__False i suppose
__label__False i well it make it easier to do powerpoint
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False because not every module keep a memory of everything that happened so whenever the uh um person is not actually rejecting what happened before so a in
__label__False yeah
__label__False and i think you re in the process of doing that so you can you can
__label__False hmm
__label__False well the key file is ke key file s different
__label__False the uh
__label__False heaven forbid this noise compensation process may be imperfect but uh so maybe it s treating some thing differently
__label__False yeah
__label__False lisp notation and generate an xml uh tree
__label__False the vad later will be much better yeah so
__label__False that s good validation
__label__False um which
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False seven one o eight one nine eight four five eight seven seven
__label__False you know it depends on what meeting
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False and one of the thing we need to do is the um and this i think is relatively tight tightly constrained is to finish up this beliefnet stuff so
__label__False so you can right so you can
__label__True and so the current state of thing is that again starting now um we d like to actually get a running beliefnet for this particular subdomain done in the next few week
__label__False that s good to know
__label__False and so your speech ch wa s saying something about mixed signal and the next turn wa a lot of people saying mixed like he mean mixed signal or i think it s mixed and the word mixed in this segment occurs like a bunch of time
__label__False that that if we have someone who is doing acoustic study uh it s nice to have the same for every recording
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False transcript l twentynine
__label__False ah ok
__label__False and when we put the m m the em
__label__False oh you mean just break the one hour into a few chunk
__label__False n well but you can use the when you re doing the scoring since you re you re gon na be scoring against transcript you can use
__label__False yeah uh a statue or um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False we do nt have to do the digit at all if we do nt want to
__label__False so um you had like an action schema and a sourcepathgoal schema right so how doe this sourcepathgoal schema fit into the uh action schema like is it one of the tag there
__label__False yes
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False and that seems pretty good
__label__False certainly it would be tricky about it intrans in transmitting voice uh uh for listening to is that these kind of thing uh cut speech off a lot right
__label__False what
__label__False i ve been trying
__label__False you know having this headset reminds me of like working at burger king or something no i never did
__label__False one one six seven three eight eight five five seven
__label__False yeah
__label__False s source it will be you know we ll f we know a lot about source so we ll put all of that in source but it s independent whether we are using the spg schema in an enter view or approach mode right this is just property of the spg schema
__label__False and and uh i am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do and so much fun that they re gon na go through and bleep out stuff and they can bleep out stuff they do nt like too right from somebody else a you say you know so well i did nt like what he said
__label__False so
__label__False yeah we we spoke about it already yeah
__label__False uh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so i ll dis i ll disregard these number
__label__False this friday
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so we can just map map them to
__label__False a decision node for every possible question you mean
__label__False l two o three three two six eight seven two six seven six eight o three one six four six three five seven five two o six five four two three five three six one o eight nine two nine two four three seven zero zero nine two
__label__False yeah yeah
__label__False gaus gaussian
__label__False yeah
__label__False so do you think it s reasonable to display more than one before the demo cuz
__label__False uhhuh
__label__False but with this new format um that hopefully they re not hearing that and if they are it should nt throw them
__label__False yeah
__label__False what are wh when are we are we going to do that who are they going to be what meeting are we going to record
__label__False so i guess i probably should at the minimum think about how to present it in a printed form
__label__True when do you go back
__label__False so um
__label__False here s a sequence that this sort of roughly fit into
__label__False well that ll teach them to roll their window up
__label__False just do or a free ri yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False right
__label__False right
__label__False uh it might even be sooner uh let s see this is the sixteenth seventeenth
__label__False hi
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah um so the evaluation should be on a week before or
__label__False yep
__label__False ok so i guess the question is when you actually fill one of these out it ll be under action schema those are
__label__False you could
__label__True yeah i guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps with all these minor thing modified
__label__False hubfive
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False you do two iteration of that
__label__False oh
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False why i had i did need to chan generate different tree than the german one mainly because you know like uh the gerund in in german is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb so i d uh have to add am walking or i d have to add a little stem for the am when i build the built the tree
__label__False seven three three zero five one eight five zero
__label__False would it be
__label__False i am too
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right this wa this wa the point of having near zero skew right
__label__False yeah
__label__False uh that s true although um role
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False oh good so you have nt made it so much fun
__label__False right
__label__False um
__label__False whatever granularity uhhuh
__label__False i bet you get better than sixty three
__label__False uh
__label__False yeah it s more segment or yeah
__label__False that part is fine
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False ok so it s then then it s it s it s reasonable to expect it would be helpful if we used it with the sri system and
__label__False yeah
__label__False well i but i have a suggestion about that um obviously this is very very timeconsuming and you re finding lot of thing which i m sure are gon na be very interesting but in the interest of making progress uh might i s how how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlap
__label__False i i saw directory called source or
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False wi to that schema and we will have you know forced motion and cost action action
__label__False because you can have multiple channel there s a single timeline it s very clear flexible and all those nice thing
__label__False see
__label__False i mean you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said but when they hear it themselves they may hear something different because they know what they meant
__label__False uh transcript l one one six
__label__False yeah it s different this is the uh dna building or someth the double helix building
__label__False i mean to give an example of um something we used to do uh at one point uh back back when chuck wa here in early time is we would take um da take a word and uh have a canonical pronunciation and uh if there wa five phone in a word you d break up the word uh into five equallength piece which is completely gross
__label__False i i m g i m guessing it wa the the training data
__label__False at least yeah he ll t he ll probably be interested
__label__False alm three hundred overlapping zone
__label__False if i use eh the lda filter that are training with the noisy speech that hurt the re my result
__label__False yeah well what i did is t is to take um to measure the average no the maximum energy of s each utterance and then put a threshold
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so um uh anyway that s that s kind of a reasonable thing that i d like to have somebody try somebody look and and the digit would be a reasonable thing to do that with i think that d be enough data plenty of data to do that with and i for that sort of task you would nt care whether it wa uh large vocabulary speech or anything uh
__label__False oh so right so the training the the neural net is being trained with noise compensated stuff which make sense but uh you re saying yeah the noisier one are still going to be even after our noise compensation are still gon na be pretty noisy
__label__False yeah most of tidigits is connected digit i think the i mean we had a bellcore corpus that we were using it wa that s that wa isolated digit
__label__False that s good
__label__False the other thing too is it seems like go ahead
__label__False no that that s important so what what it s saying here is just that yes there is a reduction in performance when you do nt um have the s when you do nt have um
__label__False yeah
__label__False and you know since there are no more than you know ten speaker or so per meeting there s plenty of tone space
__label__False five
__label__False i think a a sort of general strategy here
__label__False using the clean filter
__label__False well
__label__False mmm yeah
__label__False so um i i did s i did some double checking to look through i mean you d need to have extra hhh e extra complication like time tag indicating the beginning and ending of of the laughing through the utterance and that and what they re doing is in both case just saying curly bracket laughing a after the unit
__label__False ok
__label__False so so but where is this now i mean what s where do we go from here i mean we so we have a we have a a system that work pretty well but it s not you know the system that people here are used to using to working with so what what do we do now
__label__False and in fact most method that people now use were originally tried with something that wa not their absolute best system at some level
__label__False good
__label__False and at the rate we re going we ll get pretty close to that i think this semester
__label__False so there s um
__label__False but
__label__False right
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False right
__label__False beep y right
__label__False so get simpler network because we still have the feature
__label__False yeah so there are there is this there could be also the um something like the maximum of the autocorrelation function or which
__label__False i guess your plan for
__label__False right
__label__False oh
__label__False uh
__label__False uh ok so where where is it cuz i ll have to take a look
__label__False right right
__label__False oh sure
__label__False um
__label__False yeah so i m i m still hopeful that that i mean we we do nt even know if the phase is something the average phase is something that we do want to remove i mean maybe there s some deeper reason why it is nt the right thing to do but um at least in principle it look like there s there s uh a couple potential way to do it one one being to just work with the complex number um and uh in rectangular kind of coordinate and the other is to uh do a taylor series
__label__False one three seven one o five one two
__label__False s sixtyfour
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False hmm
__label__False um it occur it occurs to me that i mean ne um well i should have we should have added an ano an xml example or some xml example and and this is on on a on on my list of thing until next next week
__label__False right no i think that d be great if we can get more data
__label__True i mean the other thing you could do is boot trying to to uh get those binary variable and take the continuous variable from uh the uh uh the data itself there but
__label__False yeah
__label__False huh
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False nine eight eight zero three one nine one one eight
__label__False say if we had to y deal with arbitrary language it would nt make any sense to do that because there d be no way to generate the node for every possible sentence
__label__False i mean that might actually work because you ll
__label__False yeah
__label__False mmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True whe when are you two getting back
__label__False five more processor
__label__False yeah
__label__False hmm
__label__False well you put them together and trained the vad on them mmm
__label__False what will that do is that going to
__label__False yep
__label__False so
__label__False you know this is this we re we re covering we re playing the lawyer s game and we re playing we re we re we re looking for the extreme case
__label__False yeah sure
__label__False right
__label__False it would take a little work but not any real human not a lot of human work
__label__False so um
__label__False um i think that d be fantastic cuz those kind of panel and those have interesting
__label__False right
__label__False gothere ha two value right gothere and notgothere let s assume those are the posterior probability of that
__label__False yeah i can i can show you i yeah our
__label__False you know
__label__False that s it yeah
__label__False yeah i think that s a good example actually
__label__False yeah
__label__False so it s more of an issue of of structuring it with uh the uh sys admin folk so we do nt panic them and figuring out where it go
__label__False well that s what i wonder because um or how bad it is be um because that would be interesting especially because the bottleneck is the transcription right
__label__False yeah
__label__False i just put yes
__label__False identify four region maybe make up some feature for each region and uh and uh uh and uh middle layer for those
__label__True thirtyfirst august
__label__False oh that s uh i wa just thinking one thing we may wan na do is put the fake pda right in front of someone instead of in the middle of the table like we have it now on the thought that my vision of it is you know each of u will have our little pda in front of u and so the acoustic uh you might want to try to match the acoustic
__label__False right
__label__False that s a very good that s a very good uh suggestion
__label__False yeah d uh it s much better when you we used the clean derived
__label__False so do you just take the probability of the other one and spread them out evenly among the the remaining one
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False one zero
__label__False yeah
__label__False you re busy
__label__False she s willing to do it meaning be the wizard for the data collection also maybe transcribe a little bit if she ha to but also recruiting subject organizing them and so forth
__label__True well since you did nt answer the emai so there wa a q question i had asked adam whether it s possible to search only for your own name your own utterance so that you know you do nt have to go through the whole meeting and
__label__False is that maybe that s accuracy
__label__False bayesnet spec
__label__False someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we ve taken is more let come up with feature approach and multistream approach and so forth that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal
__label__False no i really do nt want to see that movie bed mn i d rather stay home and watch tv um
__label__False yeah
__label__False right
__label__False um and that s that s why when people started getting database that had a little more noise in it like like uh um
__label__False and so perhaps they will change the weight to
__label__False and but it run much much faster
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah there is actually a text file that you can edit
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False that s nice wow
__label__False yep
__label__False that i i
__label__False oh it doe nt mean that they re unambiguous i mean a cafe can be construed a a container or it can be construed you know a a a obstacle or a some physical object so there are multiple construal
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah
__label__False this is the uh what the action planner us this is ok
__label__False no
__label__False o eight three four zero five three one two o six o seven three zero five two six four eight eight one seven eight six seven four eight six one nine four nine
__label__False so you could do a you could do a stricter one
__label__False yeah i m sure he d appreciate that
__label__False um so basically that s that s what i ve been doing and
__label__False and so they can hear something then step on the pedal and quickly rewind and go back and hear it again and so they re
__label__False and every when we now start introducing some some noise reduction technique we we introduce also somehow artificial distortion
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False yeah so well for unvoiced portion we have something tha that ha a mean around o point three and for voiced portion the mean is o point fiftynine
__label__False do we know anything about who who s wa it that had the lowest on the dev set
__label__False how about them energy crisis
__label__False right
__label__False that would be a cue
__label__False and so then the that that make the highlymatched the really big thing
__label__False yeah so so nob so no one ha in in of the uh professional linguist they have nt there wa this whole thesis on out of
__label__False right
__label__False hmm
__label__False and for each s uh frame of the speech the only thing that i need to do is to calculate this in order to calculate the estimation of the clean speech given our noisy speech
__label__False but no this is good progress
__label__False there is nt any klt or anything
__label__False you have a big list of of thing to do
__label__False wow
__label__False yeah
__label__False he did a paper on this for some v speech verification uh project and we basically e extrapolated what he what he did for that work and applied it to our file
__label__False yeah
__label__False if we moved onto the next step and did learning of some sort uh according bhaskara we d be handicapped
__label__False so you know
__label__False oh whoop i forgot to uh
__label__False yep
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False it s just in this case they were not
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False another one just bit the dust
__label__False yeah no and i did nt have a chance to do that
__label__False i d like to see that yeah
__label__False so and i i
__label__False hmm
__label__False there s this fortyfive minute piece that jane transcribed
__label__False and i went in and more or le by hand corrected it by loading it i wrote a script that will convert it to the multi the channeltrans format looked at it in in channeltrans and found the place where it got a unsynchronized and then either
__label__False i do nt know m
__label__False and but if you had a a really big training set a recognizer uh system that wa capable of taking advantage of a really large training set
__label__False yeah
__label__False well the the the utterance wa is there a bakery around here not
__label__False uh
__label__False in the meeting so far yeah
__label__False yeah that s like fundamental frequency
__label__False they just you know churn them out and do nt check them
__label__True uh that s during eurospeech
__label__False yeah yeah and we still do nt have the neural net in so so it s you know so it s
__label__False the s actionschemas basically have extra
__label__False zero one nine three nine eight zero three five zero
__label__False there s a tree where one ha crossed the river but no one ha ever crossed the river or something like that
__label__False you do nt have anything to say
__label__False it s
__label__False o one nine seven four zero two six one six two eight four eight three three seven three four five o five o eight five six seven three eight eight eight two nine three nine seven eight four o
__label__False yeah
__label__False i do nt remember
__label__False right
__label__False maybe
__label__False yeah ok
__label__False origo is a terminus technikus in that sense that s even used in the english literature origo
__label__False oh w
__label__False so the alignment from the different database that are used for training came from different system
__label__False i mean it seems now if you just ha make one mistake then everything is off
__label__False exactly
__label__False hmm
__label__False one five eight one nine six three nine five nine six seven
__label__False i d i did quickly i did the silence model and and um that s coming out with about one point two second a it average duration and the silence model s the one that s used at the beginning and the end of each of the string of digit
__label__False wa it last week or whenever
__label__False that s an idea
__label__False yep
__label__False right
__label__True you only sent me one thing which wa demo status
__label__False well the the the binding is technically no problem but it s it for me it seems to be conceptually important that we find out if we can s if if there if there are thing in there that are sort of a general nature we should distill them out and put them where the schema are
__label__False i should probably ping him just to make sure that he got it
__label__False so they re training up net to try to recognize these acoustic feature
__label__False am i on i guess so
__label__False that ll help a lot actually
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah that would be that would be nice
__label__False yeah
__label__False so it seemed like it wa a good idea to make one um
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so probably if we only take the close microphone i guess the result should be much much better than this
__label__False ah
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False how m
__label__False ok
__label__True one of the thing that adam said that i thought would be a good idea would be um if we g used different beep so for example if we alternated between two beep a high and a low th
__label__False so there wa a significant loss from not doing the adaptation
__label__False but but uh
__label__False it wa when i wa working for the government
__label__False i want that on a tshirt
__label__False ge
__label__False so that s why i wan na do it
__label__False yeah
__label__False um which is not great because for instance
__label__False um generally we we think that most of the error are within phoneme class and so i think it could be interesting to to see if it
__label__False yeah
__label__False well maybe it wo nt be after this deadline extension maybe they ll
__label__False i just hate not to get data
__label__False ok
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False mmm so it s just uh the next two where there will be there you know may a well be meeting but i just wo nt be at them
__label__False the english system
__label__False yeah
__label__False i mean is it something of interest
__label__False whoever will pay you
__label__False well i well it s an xml structure that s being re returned right
__label__False i do nt know if the other would would add some other helpful dimension or not
__label__False that s great i know
__label__False yeah
__label__False i guess it doe w
__label__False hmm interesting
__label__False right
__label__False like that the avatar and um
__label__False mu
__label__False yeah i think it s better
__label__False mmhmm
__label__True so you have an independent estimator of what the silence probability is and you could multiply the two thing and renormalize
__label__False oh r rzero
__label__False you mean the
__label__False yep
__label__False sure
__label__False yeah
__label__False right so it s still the same same microphone in both case but uh it s there s a mismatch between the car condition and that s uh you could argue that s a pretty realistic situation and uh i d almost argue for weighting that highest but the way they have it now it s i guess it s it s
__label__False or you could you could have ascending tone or something
__label__False oh wow
__label__False all ready
__label__False how many battery do you go through
__label__False stm s uh segment time marked where
__label__False yeah they re all really short
__label__False there typically do nt no
__label__False um and then use that a a reference and tune the parameter of the of the model uh to op to get the best performance
__label__False right ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False so th
__label__False um and the hope in all of this is that by going multiband and by going into these um intermediate classification that we can get a system that s more robust to to unseen noise and situation like that um and so some of the research issue involved in this are um one what kind of intermediate category do we need to classify
__label__False uh
__label__False ok
__label__False yeah
__label__False yeah
__label__False ok
__label__False no
__label__False mmhmm
__label__False so doe he wan na know where it is or doe he wan na go there
__label__False th the faculty are nt faculty are nt supposed to know
__label__False i mean we have dropped some silence f
__label__False right well i i bet they would be willing to do it the first few time just for the novelty
__label__False ok now all of this is
__label__False mmhmm yeah
__label__False yeah that would be whatever building they referred to
__label__False yeah it wa fine i think y
__label__False ok so if we take uh um let s see
__label__False and there s a there s a script and that is actually all in one script so there s this one script that par waveform name and extract thing like the um speaker uh id or something that can stand in a a speaker id so we might have to modify that script to recognize the um speaker um in the in the uh um tidigits database
__label__False he s got the memory for it so
__label__True so i m i i just need to ask um malek
__label__False should we be discussing this uh
__label__False uh bu i m i m i m just scared that with two second you get you get um you you get false recognition you re gon na
__label__False and it may also be due to the alignment because well the reference alignment because right now i just use an alignment obtained from from a system trained on channel zero
__label__True ibm transcription
__label__False you know i i still do nt exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in in this thing or what the module are and so on so you know like just that suchandsuch module uh um decides that it want to achieve the goal of greeting the user and then magically it sort of s
__label__False uh there s one in my office so
__label__False yeah
