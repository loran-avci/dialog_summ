Bmr019	0.323	1.460	me011	O_K, we're on.
Bmr019	1.622	2.631	me013	O_K.
Bmr019	2.304	5.340	me011	So, I mean, everyone who's on the wireless check that they're on.
Bmr019	2.354	2.947	me001	Alright.
Bmr019	2.374	2.898	mn017	C- we -
Bmr019	3.392	4.123	fe008	I see.
Bmr019	6.250	6.719	mn017	Yeah.
Bmr019	6.488	7.121	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr019	8.110	10.721	me011	<open_agenda> O_K, our agenda was quite short </open_agenda>.
Bmr019	9.692	12.551	me013	Oh, could you close the door, maybe? Yeah.
Bmr019	11.433	23.990	me011	Sure. Two items, which was, uh, digits and possibly stuff on - on, uh, forced alignment, which Jane said that Liz and Andreas had in- information on, but they didn't, so.
Bmr019	21.903	22.564	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	23.425	25.720	me013	I guess the only other thing, uh, for which I -
Bmr019	25.119	29.020	mn017	We should do that second, because Liz might join us in time for that.
Bmr019	27.884	28.589	me011	O_K.
Bmr019	29.287	33.858	me013	Um. O_K, so there's digits, alignments, and, um,
Bmr019	34.387	44.190	me013	<find_calendar_entry> I guess the other thing, which I came unprepared for, uh, is, uh, to dis- s- s- see if there's anything anybody wants to discuss about the <start_date> Saturday </start_date> <entry_type> meeting </entry_type> </find_calendar_entry>.
Bmr019	44.087	44.860	me011	Right.
Bmr019	45.524	45.996	me013	So.
Bmr019	46.501	48.219	me013	Any - I mean, maybe not.
Bmr019	47.383	49.855	me011	Digits and alignments.
Bmr019	50.691	51.235	me011	But -
Bmr019	52.030	52.663	me013	Uh.
Bmr019	52.075	56.250	mn017	Talk about aligning people's schedules.
Bmr019	54.028	55.136	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	54.148	55.020	me011	Yeah.
Bmr019	54.976	55.411	fe008	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	56.436	59.140	me013	Yeah. I mean - Right. Yeah, I mean, it was -
Bmr019	57.650	62.107	me011	Yeah, it's forced alignment of people's schedules.
Bmr019	59.203	61.540	mn017	Yeah. If we're very -
Bmr019	59.770	62.310	mn014	Forced align.
Bmr019	61.408	62.604	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	61.998	62.455	mn017	Yeah.
Bmr019	62.604	69.286	me013	With - with - whatever it was, a month and a half or something ahead of time, the only time we could find in common - roughly in common, was on a Saturday.
Bmr019	69.093	69.504	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	69.286	70.863	me013	Ugh.
Bmr019	69.410	71.201	me011	Yep.
Bmr019	70.069	72.710	mn017	It's pretty sad. Yeah.
Bmr019	71.793	72.445	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	73.151	78.155	fe008	Have - Have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of - in more of the meeting?
Bmr019	78.155	80.950	fe008	I - I mean, I don't know, if we had the - if we had the telephone on the table -
Bmr019	80.838	83.796	me013	No. But, h- I mean, he probably has to go do something. Right?
Bmr019	81.280	87.957	mn017	No, actually I - I have to - I have to shuttle kids from various places to various other places.
Bmr019	84.690	85.516	fe008	I see.
Bmr019	87.590	88.047	fe008	O_K.
Bmr019	87.723	88.534	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	87.957	95.020	mn017	So. And I don't have - and I don't, um, have a cell phone so I can't be having a conference call while driving.
Bmr019	92.012	92.726	mn014	A cell phone?
Bmr019	94.591	96.253	fe008	No. It's not good. That's not good.
Bmr019	94.949	96.713	me013	R- r- right. So we have to - we -
Bmr019	95.781	98.609	mn017	Plus, it would make for interesting noise - background noise.
Bmr019	98.336	107.771	me013	So we have to equip him with a - with a - with a head-mounted, uh, cell phone and -
Bmr019	98.384	98.760	me011	Yep.
Bmr019	98.609	100.340	mn017	Uh -
Bmr019	101.588	108.663	me011	Ye- we- and we'd have to force you to read lots and lots of digits, so it could get real - real car noise.
Bmr019	104.550	106.780	mn017	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Bmr019	104.859	108.114	me001	Take advantage.
Bmr019	105.275	105.893	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	109.309	111.432	mn014	And with the kids in the background. Yeah.
Bmr019	109.410	110.209	mn017	I'll let - I'd let -
Bmr019	110.850	114.402	mn017	I let, uh, my five-year-old have a try at the digits, eh.
Bmr019	113.944	114.444	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	115.260	121.220	me011	So, anyway, I can talk about digits. Um, did everyone get the results or shall I go over them again?
Bmr019	121.713	127.317	me011	I mean that it was basically - the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well.
Bmr019	127.752	136.083	me011	Um, and in retrospect that's not as surprising as maybe i- it shouldn't have been as surprising as I - as - as I felt it was.
Bmr019	136.083	138.849	me011	The lapel mike is a very high-quality microphone.
Bmr019	138.849	146.054	me011	And as Morgan pointed out, that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling if no one else is talking.
Bmr019	145.878	146.571	mn017	Exactly.
Bmr019	146.240	146.689	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	146.695	147.091	me001	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	147.039	148.960	me011	Um, so, uh -
Bmr019	148.812	149.306	me001	It's g- it -
Bmr019	148.960	154.453	me013	Well, it's - Yeah, sort of the bre- the breath noises and the mouth clicks and so forth like that, the lapel's gonna be better on.
Bmr019	149.568	150.567	mn014	Or the cross-talk.
Bmr019	153.742	154.078	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	154.453	159.090	me013	The lapel is typically worse on the - on clothes rustling, but if no one's rustling their clothes,
Bmr019	159.090	165.847	me011	Right. I mean, a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits, so it's - it's a very different task than sort of the natural. So.
Bmr019	161.293	162.990	me013	it's - it's -
Bmr019	163.641	167.659	mn014	Yeah. You don't move much during reading digits, I think.
Bmr019	165.556	166.365	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	167.284	167.880	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	167.390	168.170	me011	Right.
Bmr019	167.785	173.502	me001	Probably the fact that it picks up other people's speakers - other people's talking is an indication of that it - the fact it is a good microphone.
Bmr019	170.077	170.495	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	173.629	174.776	me011	Right. Right.
Bmr019	173.781	178.160	me013	Right. So in the digits, in most - most cases, there weren't other people talking. So.
Bmr019	174.174	174.708	me001	So.
Bmr019	177.363	180.660	mn017	D- do the lapel mikes have any directionality to them?
Bmr019	180.822	182.162	me013	There typically don't, no.
Bmr019	182.150	189.210	mn017	Because I - I suppose you could make some that have sort of - that you have to orient towards your mouth, and then it would -
Bmr019	187.911	191.990	me011	They have a little bit, but they're not noise-cancelling. So, uh -
Bmr019	191.362	193.854	me013	They're - they're intended to be omni-directional.
Bmr019	193.729	194.282	me011	Right.
Bmr019	194.810	195.206	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	194.835	198.061	me013	And th- it's - and because you don't know how people are gonna put them on, you know.
Bmr019	197.249	197.695	me011	Right.
Bmr019	198.119	203.066	me011	So, also, Andreas, on that one the - the back part of it should be right against your head.
Bmr019	203.553	206.164	me011	And that will he- keep it from flopping aro- up and down as much.
Bmr019	206.320	207.419	mn017	It is against my head.
Bmr019	206.910	207.679	me011	O_K.
Bmr019	207.835	208.273	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	209.244	212.864	me013	Um. <find_calendar_entry> Yeah, <contact_name> we </contact_name> actually talked about this in the, uh, <title> front-end </title> <entry_type> meeting </entry_type> <start_time> this morning </start_time>, too </find_calendar_entry>.
Bmr019	212.632	214.310	me011	Uh-huh.
Bmr019	212.864	246.791	me013	Much the same thing, and - and it was - uh, I mean, there the point of interest to the group was primarily that, um, the, uh - the system that we had that was based on H_T_ K, that's used by, you know, all the participants in Aurora, was so much worse than the - than the S_R_ I. And the interesting thing is that even though, yes, it's a digits task and that's a relatively small number of words and there's a bunch of digits that you train on, it's just not as good as having a - a l- very large amount of data and training up a - a - a nice good big
Bmr019	225.009	225.990	me011	Everybody.
Bmr019	246.791	251.560	me013	H_M_M. Um, also you had the adaptation in the S_R_I system, which we didn't have in this.
Bmr019	251.560	253.393	me013	Um. So.
Bmr019	253.393	254.500	me013	Um.
Bmr019	254.159	255.029	mn017	And we know -
Bmr019	255.274	258.230	mn017	<find_email> Di- did <from_contact_name> I </from_contact_name> send <contact_name> you </contact_name> some <email_subject> results without adaptation </email_subject> </find_email>?
Bmr019	258.063	261.560	me011	No. Or if you did, I didn't include them, cuz it was -
Bmr019	258.443	262.910	me013	I- s- I think Stephane, uh, had seen them. So -
Bmr019	262.810	264.413	mn017	Yeah, I think I did, actually.
Bmr019	264.413	268.388	mn017	So there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation.
Bmr019	268.590	269.658	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	269.190	269.714	mn017	Um.
Bmr019	270.340	272.520	mn017	A - a - a couple percent or some- I mean -
Bmr019	273.145	275.123	mn017	Well, I don't know it - Overall -
Bmr019	276.132	284.860	mn017	Uh, I - I don't remember, but there was - there was a significant, um, loss or win from adaptation - with - with adaptation.
Bmr019	285.520	300.692	mn017	And, um, that was the phone-loop adaptation. And then there was a very small - like point one percent on the natives - uh, win from doing, um, you know, adaptation to the recognition hypotheses.
Bmr019	301.266	317.000	mn017	And I tried both means adaptation and means and variances, and the variances added another - or subtracted another point one percent. So, it's, um - that's the number there. Point six, I believe, is what you get with both, uh, means and variance adaptation.
Bmr019	311.925	312.400	me011	Right.
Bmr019	317.592	320.625	me013	But I think one thing is that, uh, I would presume -
Bmr019	320.625	321.989	me013	Hav- Have you ever t-
Bmr019	321.989	326.440	me013	Have you ever tried this exact same recognizer out on the actual T_I-digits test set?
Bmr019	328.910	331.068	mn017	This exact same recognizer? No.
Bmr019	330.528	336.330	me013	It might be interesting to do that. Cuz my - my - cuz my sense, um -
Bmr019	334.512	340.191	mn017	But - but, I have - I mean, people - people at S_R_I are actually working on digits.
Bmr019	335.930	337.960	me011	I bet it would do even slightly better.
Bmr019	340.191	359.254	mn017	I could - and they are using a system that's, um - you know, h- is actually trained on digits, um, but h- h- otherwise uses the same, you know, decoder, the same, uh, training methods, and so forth, and I could ask them what they get on T_I-digits.
Bmr019	350.266	350.798	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	357.315	363.854	me013	Yeah, bu- although I'd be - I think it'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system so that these numbers were comparable and try it out on T_I-digits.
Bmr019	361.388	366.880	mn017	Mm-hmm. Well, Adam knows how to run it, so you just make a f-
Bmr019	364.057	365.310	me011	Yeah. No problem.
Bmr019	364.200	384.022	me013	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz our sense from the other - from the Aurora, uh, task is that - I mean, cuz we were getting sub one percent numbers on T_I-digits also with the tandem thing. So, one - so there were a number of things we noted from this. One is, yeah, the S_R_I system is a lot better than the H_T_K - this, you know, very limited training H_T_K system.
Bmr019	366.230	368.100	me011	And try it with T_I-digits?
Bmr019	368.546	369.402	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	372.151	373.109	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	374.953	375.750	mn017	Mmm.
Bmr019	380.427	380.842	mn017	Hmm.
Bmr019	383.139	384.003	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	384.022	395.603	me013	Uh, but the other is that, um, the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes, i- uh, are actually a lot harder than the studio-recording T_I-digits.
Bmr019	395.603	403.069	me013	I think, you know, one reason for that, uh, might be that there's still - even though it's close-talking, there still is some noise and some room acoustics.
Bmr019	395.833	396.765	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	401.485	402.448	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	403.069	416.980	me013	And another might be that, uh, I'd - I would presume that in the studio, uh, uh, situation recording read speech that if somebody did something a little funny or n- pronounced something a little funny or made a little - that they didn't include it, they made them do it again.
Bmr019	413.888	414.877	me011	They didn't include it.
Bmr019	415.740	421.456	me011	Whereas, I took out the ones that I noticed that were blatant - that were correctable.
Bmr019	420.404	420.859	me013	Mmm.
Bmr019	421.472	422.380	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	421.931	432.795	me011	So that, if someone just read the wrong digit, I corrected it. And then there was another one where Jose couldn't tell whether - I couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six. And I asked him and he couldn't tell either.
Bmr019	424.740	425.400	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	431.789	432.293	me026	Hmm.
Bmr019	432.795	434.080	me011	So I just cut it out.
Bmr019	434.646	438.879	me011	You know, so I just e- edited out the first, i- uh, word of the utterance.
Bmr019	434.793	435.774	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	438.879	442.579	me011	Um, so there's a little bit of correction but it's definitely not as clean as T_I-digits.
Bmr019	442.579	445.528	me011	So my expectations is T_I-digits would, especially -
Bmr019	446.380	454.740	me011	I think T_I-digits is all American English. Right? So it would probably do even a little better still on the S_R_I system, but we could give it a try.
Bmr019	449.341	449.969	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	453.418	478.713	mn017	Well. But remember, we're using a telephone bandwidth front-end here, uh, on this, uh - on this S_R_I system, so, um, I was - I thought that maybe that's actually a good thing because it - it gets rid of some of the - uh, the noises, um, you know, in the - the - below and above the - um, the, you know, speech bandwidth and, um,
Bmr019	471.997	473.125	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	476.903	477.346	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	479.210	491.860	mn017	I suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher-quality recordings you would have to in fact, uh, use models that, uh, were trained on wider-band data. And of course we can't do that or -
Bmr019	491.882	493.650	me011	Wha- what's T_I-digits? I thought t-
Bmr019	493.575	498.820	me013	It's wide-band, yeah. It's - in - in fact, we looked it up and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling.
Bmr019	494.500	496.135	me011	It is wide-band. O_K.
Bmr019	498.260	503.330	me011	Oh, that's right. I - I did look that up. I couldn't remember whether that was T_I-digits or one of the other digit tasks.
Bmr019	498.877	499.670	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	500.397	500.969	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	501.630	502.122	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	502.765	506.680	mn017	But - but, I would - Yeah. It's - it's easy enough to try, just run it on -
Bmr019	506.968	511.422	me011	Mm-hmm. So, Morgan, you're getting a little breath noise. You might wanna move the mike down a little bit.
Bmr019	507.042	507.545	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	508.209	509.250	me013	See w-
Bmr019	508.289	527.142	mn017	Now, eh, does - one - one issue - one issue with - with that is that um, the system has this, uh, notion of a speaker to - which is used in adaptation, variance norm- uh, you know, both in, uh, mean and variance normalization and also in the V_T_L estimation. So -
Bmr019	523.841	524.505	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	527.572	529.980	me011	Yeah, I noticed the script that extracted it.
Bmr019	527.795	528.129	mn017	Do y- ?
Bmr019	528.129	528.586	mn017	Is - ?
Bmr019	528.586	535.480	mn017	So does - so th- so does - does, um, the T_I-digits database have speakers that are known?
Bmr019	534.147	535.762	me011	Yep. Yep.
Bmr019	535.937	542.088	mn017	And is there - is there enough data or a comparable - comparable amount of data to - to what we have in our recordings here?
Bmr019	537.660	539.638	me011	That I don't know.
Bmr019	539.974	540.983	me011	I don't know.
Bmr019	541.750	545.526	me011	I don't know how many speakers there are, and - and how many speakers per utterance.
Bmr019	543.352	544.033	mn017	O_K.
Bmr019	543.507	544.120	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	544.911	550.351	me013	Well, the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation.
Bmr019	550.746	551.312	me013	That would -
Bmr019	550.861	558.478	mn017	Right. Uh, but I'm not so much worried about the adaptation, actually, than - than the, um, um - the, uh,
Bmr019	559.072	560.397	mn017	V_T_L estimation.
Bmr019	560.397	569.922	mn017	If you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the - the warping, uh, factor. So, um -
Bmr019	560.609	561.084	me011	Right.
Bmr019	570.003	573.160	me011	I strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do.
Bmr019	573.410	577.158	mn017	Right. But it's not the amount of speakers, it's the num- it's the amount of data per speaker.
Bmr019	573.623	574.750	me011	So, uh -
Bmr019	576.886	581.071	me011	Right. So we - we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent.
Bmr019	578.150	578.651	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	579.936	580.430	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	581.620	582.383	mn017	So -
Bmr019	581.620	582.680	me011	Um.
Bmr019	583.493	590.220	me011	So, although I - I sort of know how to run it, there are a little - a f- few details here and there that I'll have to dig out.
Bmr019	587.039	588.162	mn017	O_K. The key -
Bmr019	588.670	593.578	mn017	So th- the system actually extracts the speaker I_D from the waveform names.
Bmr019	593.599	594.568	me011	Right. I saw that.
Bmr019	593.993	619.175	mn017	And there's a - there's a script - and that is actually all in one script. So there's this one script that parses waveform names and extracts things like the, um, speaker, uh, I_D or something that can stand in as a speaker I_D. So, we might have to modify that script to recognize the, um, speakers, um, in the - in the, uh, um, T_I-digits database.
Bmr019	611.320	612.110	me011	Right.
Bmr019	617.696	618.389	me011	Right.
Bmr019	619.417	620.730	me011	And that, uh -
Bmr019	620.399	629.766	mn017	Or you can fake - you can fake names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the - for the meetings.
Bmr019	628.239	630.019	me011	Right.
Bmr019	629.766	633.060	mn017	That would be the, sort of - probably the safest way to do -
Bmr019	631.530	638.216	me011	I might have to do that anyway to - to do - because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about right.
Bmr019	638.147	638.758	mn017	Uh-huh.
Bmr019	638.972	642.312	me011	The other thing is, isn't T_I-digits isolated digits?
Bmr019	639.263	639.700	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	642.312	647.732	me011	Or is that another one? I'm - I looked through a bunch of the digits t- corp- corpora, and now they're all blurring.
Bmr019	648.161	648.846	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	648.290	652.190	me011	Cuz one of them was literally people reading a single digit.
Bmr019	653.711	655.980	me011	And then others were connected digits.
Bmr019	655.808	663.508	me013	Yeah. Most of T_I-digits is connected digits, I think. The - I mean, we had a Bellcore corpus that we were using. It was - that's - that was isolated digits.
Bmr019	657.615	658.184	me011	O_K.
Bmr019	660.594	662.100	me011	Maybe it's the Bell Gram .
Bmr019	662.829	663.621	me011	Bell Digits.
Bmr019	664.076	664.590	me011	Alright.
Bmr019	664.633	665.497	me013	Um.
Bmr019	664.770	681.655	mn017	By the way, I think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr- improve them by, um, not starting with the Switchboard models but by taking the Switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting.
Bmr019	680.667	680.975	me011	Yep.
Bmr019	682.089	689.360	mn017	Because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics and f- for the far-field microphones, you know, to the noise.
Bmr019	689.360	693.420	mn017	And that should really improve things, um, further.
Bmr019	694.136	703.135	mn017	And then you use those adapted models, which are not speaker adapted but sort of acous- you know, channel adapted - use that as the starting models for your speaker adaptation.
Bmr019	698.490	699.975	me011	Channel adapted.
Bmr019	703.253	703.800	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	703.800	716.523	me013	But the thing is, uh - I mean, w- when you - it depends whether you're ju- were just using this as a - a starter task for - you know, to get things going for conversational or if we're really interested i- in connected digits. And I - I think the answer is both.
Bmr019	716.190	718.340	mn017	Well, I don't know.
Bmr019	716.523	725.465	me013	And for - for connected digits over the telephone you don't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation because somebody gets on the phone and says a number and then you just want it.
Bmr019	726.010	728.370	fe008	This is - this - that one's better. Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	726.219	727.760	me013	You don't - don't, uh -
Bmr019	726.820	751.172	mn017	Right. Um, but, you know, I - uh, my impression was that you were actually interested in the far-field microphone, uh, problem, I mean. So, you want to - you want to - That's the obvious thing to try. Right? Then, eh - because you - you don't have any - That's where the most m- acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the - the r- the set up here. So.
Bmr019	739.348	740.633	fe008	Oh. Oh.
Bmr019	740.274	740.803	me013	Right.
Bmr019	741.838	743.095	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr019	748.985	749.420	me013	Right.
Bmr019	752.328	757.858	me013	Yeah. So that'd be anoth- another interesting data point. I mean, I - I guess I'm saying I don't know if we'd want to do that as the - as -
Bmr019	752.673	754.233	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	756.295	757.581	me011	Other way. Liz -
Bmr019	756.695	757.407	mn014	Other way.
Bmr019	758.679	761.725	fe016	Now you're all watching me. Alright. This way.
Bmr019	759.538	762.340	me011	It f- it clips over your ears. There you go.
Bmr019	763.144	770.173	fe008	If you have a strong fe- if you have a strong preference, you could use this. It's just we - we think it has some spikes. So, uh, we - we didn't use that one.
Bmr019	763.670	765.890	fe016	You're all watching. This is terrible.
Bmr019	769.463	770.774	fe016	I'll get it.
Bmr019	770.173	771.340	fe008	But you could if you want. I don't know.
Bmr019	771.340	775.123	fe008	And Andre- Andreas, your - your microphone's a little bit low.
Bmr019	771.450	773.318	me013	Yeah. At any rate, I don't know if w-
Bmr019	774.652	776.362	mn017	It is? Uh.
Bmr019	774.740	777.589	me013	Yeah. I don't know if we wanna use that as the -
Bmr019	775.123	775.778	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr019	776.040	777.876	me011	Uh, it pivots.
Bmr019	777.678	780.823	fe008	So if you see the picture and then you have to scr-
Bmr019	778.351	780.032	me011	It - it - like this.
Bmr019	778.360	779.039	mn017	I- I -
Bmr019	781.544	786.180	mn017	I - I already adjusted this a number of times. I - I can't quite seem to -
Bmr019	783.660	787.420	me011	Eh. Yeah, I think these mikes are not working as well as I would like.
Bmr019	787.391	791.187	mn017	Yeah, I think this contraption around your head is not working so well.
Bmr019	788.029	790.760	me013	Too many adju- too many adjustments. Yeah.
Bmr019	791.611	796.730	me013	Anyway, what I was saying is that I - I think I probably wouldn't want to see that as sort of like the norm, that we compared all things to.
Bmr019	791.734	792.836	fe008	That looks good. Yeah.
Bmr019	796.730	800.403	me013	To, uh, the - to have - have all this ad- all this, uh, adaptation.
Bmr019	800.403	803.697	me013	But I think it's an important data point, if you're - if - Yeah.
Bmr019	802.745	803.195	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	804.150	805.288	me013	Um.
Bmr019	805.990	823.509	me013	The other thing that - that, uh - of course, what Barry was looking at was - was just that, the near versus far. And, yeah, the adaptation would get th- some of that. But, I think even - even if there was, uh, only a factor of two or something, like I was saying in the email, I think that's - that's a big factor. So -
Bmr019	812.038	812.882	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	822.261	822.996	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	823.509	824.359	me013	N-
Bmr019	823.585	827.030	me011	Liz, you could also just use the other mike if you're having problems with that one.
Bmr019	825.418	826.031	fe008	Well.
Bmr019	826.026	826.763	fe016	O_K.
Bmr019	826.466	831.589	fe008	Yeah. This would be O_K. We - we - we think that this has spikes on it, so it's not as good acoustically, but -
Bmr019	828.208	832.759	fe016	It's this thing's - This is too big for my head.
Bmr019	830.356	833.152	mn017	Yeah, basically your ears are too big. I mean, mine are too.
Bmr019	832.759	840.470	fe016	No, my - my - But this is too big for my head. So, I mean, it doesn't - you know, it's sit-
Bmr019	833.152	835.459	mn017	E- th- everybody's ears are too big for these things.
Bmr019	836.606	837.298	mn017	Uh -
Bmr019	841.534	843.589	fe008	Well, if you'd rather have this one then it's -
Bmr019	842.432	845.410	fe016	O_K.
Bmr019	847.270	847.644	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	847.880	848.665	me011	Oh, well.
Bmr019	848.000	850.295	me013	It's great.
Bmr019	849.384	850.041	me011	So the -
Bmr019	850.580	854.591	me011	To get that, uh, pivoted this way, it pivots like this.
Bmr019	854.892	856.792	fe016	No this way. Yeah.
Bmr019	855.619	856.865	me011	Yeah. There you go.
Bmr019	856.680	858.104	fe008	And there's a screw that you can tighten.
Bmr019	857.221	858.586	me011	And then it - Right.
Bmr019	858.199	860.354	fe016	Right. I already tried to get it close.
Bmr019	859.672	860.226	fe008	Good.
Bmr019	860.418	863.210	me011	So if it doesn't bounce around too much, that's actually good placement.
Bmr019	863.053	866.950	fe016	O_K.
Bmr019	863.212	863.826	fe008	That looks good.
Bmr019	863.968	866.381	me011	But it looks like it's gonna bounce a lot.
Bmr019	868.303	871.290	me013	So, where were we? Uh - Yeah.
Bmr019	869.344	870.560	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr019	869.677	872.150	me011	Digits. Adaptation.
Bmr019	871.290	878.907	me013	Uh, adaptation, non-adaptation, um, factor of two, um -
Bmr019	878.791	881.550	mn017	What k- u- By the way, wh- what factor of two did you - ? I mean -
Bmr019	878.907	880.227	me013	Oh, yeah. I know what I was go- w-
Bmr019	880.936	890.782	me013	Oh, no, no. It's tha- that - that we were saying, you know, well is - how much worse is far than near, you know. And I mean it depends on which one you're looking at, but for the everybody, it's little under a factor or two.
Bmr019	884.450	887.261	mn017	Oh, th- O_K. That factor of two.
Bmr019	887.261	888.110	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	890.782	904.552	me013	Yeah. I - I know what I was thinking was that maybe, uh, i- i- we could actually t- t- try at least looking at, uh, some of the - the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone, at least from the good one.
Bmr019	903.572	904.516	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	905.079	915.239	me013	I mean, before I thought we'd get, you know, a hundred and fifty percent error or something, but if - if, uh - if we're getting thirty-five, forty percent or something, u- um -
Bmr019	907.897	909.561	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	913.960	923.012	fe016	Actually if you run, though, on a close-talking mike over the whole meeting, during all those silences, you get, like, four hundred percent word error.
Bmr019	920.494	921.150	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	922.181	925.805	me013	Right. I understand. But doing the same kind of limited thing -
Bmr019	924.979	927.500	fe016	Or - or some high number.
Bmr019	926.636	935.230	me013	Yeah, sure. Get all these insertions. But I'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing as people have done in Switchboard evaluations or as - a-
Bmr019	928.890	929.588	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	934.263	936.933	fe016	Where you know who the speaker is and there's no overlap?
Bmr019	936.941	938.068	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	937.140	939.810	fe016	And you do just the far-field for those regions?
Bmr019	940.046	942.618	me013	Yeah. The same sort of numbers that we got those graphs from. Right?
Bmr019	941.640	945.616	me011	Could we do exactly the same thing that we're doing now, but do it with a far-field mike?
Bmr019	945.367	946.554	me013	Yeah, do it with one of - on-
Bmr019	945.616	950.180	me011	Cuz we extract the times from the near-field mike, but you use the acoustics from the far-field mike.
Bmr019	949.493	954.632	fe016	Right. I understand that. I just meant that - so you have three choices. There's, um -
Bmr019	955.801	976.898	fe016	You can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were - were synchronized. Or you can do a forced alignment on the close-talking to determine that, the- you know, within this segment, these really were the times that this person was talking and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping and just front-end those pieces.
Bmr019	977.538	981.362	fe016	Or you can run it on the whole data, which is - which is, you know, a -
Bmr019	980.202	989.123	me013	But - but - but how did we get the - how did we determine the links, uh, that we're testing on in the stuff we reported?
Bmr019	989.300	1009.007	fe016	In the H_L_ T paper we took segments that are channel - time-aligned, which is now h- being changed in the transcription process, which is good, and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here, because no one else had time - any words in that segment and called that "non-overlap".
Bmr019	1007.385	1007.778	me013	And tha-
Bmr019	1008.549	1012.046	me013	And that's what we were getting those numbers from. Right.
Bmr019	1010.322	1011.054	fe016	Yes.
Bmr019	1011.577	1017.126	fe016	Tho- good - the good numbers. The bad numbers were from the segments where there was overlap.
Bmr019	1015.966	1026.290	me013	Well, we could start with the good ones. But anyway - so I think that we should try it once with the same conditions that were used to create those, and in those same segments just use one of the P_Z_Ms.
Bmr019	1017.897	1018.648	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	1025.591	1027.808	fe016	Right. So we - we can do that. Yeah.
Bmr019	1027.220	1039.426	me013	And then, you know, I mean, the thing is if we were getting, uh - what, thirty-five, forty percent, something like that on - on that particular set, uh, does it go to seventy or eighty? Or, does it use up so much memory we can't decode it?
Bmr019	1037.303	1037.936	fe016	Right.
Bmr019	1039.657	1046.294	fe016	It might also depend on which speaker th- it is and how close they are to the P_Z_M? I don't know how different they are from each other.
Bmr019	1039.986	1040.790	me013	Uh -
Bmr019	1044.575	1048.980	mn017	You want to probably choose the P_Z_M channel that is closest to the speaker.
Bmr019	1046.789	1049.202	fe016	To be best - f-
Bmr019	1047.864	1051.420	me011	For this particular digit ones, I just picked that one.
Bmr019	1048.201	1048.755	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	1049.270	1050.300	me013	Well -
Bmr019	1051.256	1054.381	fe016	O_K. So we would then use that one, too, or - ?
Bmr019	1051.660	1052.680	mn017	Oh, O_K.
Bmr019	1051.838	1052.473	me011	So -
Bmr019	1052.580	1054.283	me013	This is kind of central.
Bmr019	1054.283	1063.144	me013	You know, it's - so i- but I would - I'd pick that one. It'll be less good for some people than for other, but I - I'd like to see it on the same - exact same data set that - that we did the other thing on. Right?
Bmr019	1058.703	1059.750	me011	Actually -
Bmr019	1061.389	1066.022	me011	I sh- actually should've picked a different one, because that could be why the P_D_A is worse.
Bmr019	1066.595	1069.749	me011	Because it's further away from most of the people reading digits.
Bmr019	1067.191	1068.437	mn014	It's further away. Yeah.
Bmr019	1069.859	1070.175	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	1070.489	1071.698	me013	That's probably one of the reasons.
Bmr019	1070.524	1071.075	fe008	Hmm.
Bmr019	1072.699	1073.546	fe008	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1073.099	1077.314	fe016	Well, yeah. You could look at, I guess, that P_Z_M or something.
Bmr019	1075.721	1076.670	me011	Yep.
Bmr019	1076.959	1092.353	me013	But the other is, it's very, uh - I mean, even though there's - I'm sure the f- f- the - the S_R_I, uh, front-end has some kind of pre-emphasis, it's - it's, uh - still, th- it's picking up lots of low-frequency energy. So, even discriminating against it, I'm sure some of it's getting through.
Bmr019	1084.604	1085.358	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1093.284	1093.877	me013	Um.
Bmr019	1094.470	1097.103	me013	But, yeah, you're right. Prob- a part of it is just the distance.
Bmr019	1097.871	1099.770	fe016	And aren't these pretty bad microphones?
Bmr019	1099.460	1101.578	me013	Well, they're bad.
Bmr019	1099.537	1099.952	me011	Yep.
Bmr019	1100.205	1100.897	fe016	I mean -
Bmr019	1101.578	1107.500	me013	But, I mean, if you listen to it, it sounds O_K. You know? u- Yeah.
Bmr019	1106.565	1118.745	me011	Yeah. When you listen to it, uh, the P_Z_M and the P_D_A - Yeah, th- the P_D_A has higher sound floor but not by a lot. It's really pretty - uh, pretty much the same.
Bmr019	1116.750	1119.776	fe016	I just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose.
Bmr019	1120.172	1122.110	fe016	Cheap in terms of their quality. So.
Bmr019	1122.153	1125.400	me013	Well, they're twenty-five cents or so. Yeah.
Bmr019	1122.196	1133.591	me011	Th- we wanted them to be - to be typical of what would be in a P_D_A. So they are - they're not the P_Z_M three hundred dollar type. They're the twenty-five cent, buy them in packs of thousand type.
Bmr019	1126.205	1126.798	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1130.624	1130.947	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	1134.098	1134.591	fe016	I see.
Bmr019	1134.221	1138.780	me013	But, I mean, the thing is people use those little mikes for everything because they're really not bad.
Bmr019	1136.617	1137.730	me011	Everything.
Bmr019	1138.780	1148.107	me013	I mean, if you're not doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer, they - they - they - you know, you can hear the sou- hear the sounds just fine. You know, it's -
Bmr019	1139.032	1139.677	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1147.324	1148.033	fe016	Right.
Bmr019	1148.595	1154.391	me013	They - I mean, i- it's more or less the same principles as these other mikes are built under, it's just that there's less quality control.
Bmr019	1154.391	1156.191	me013	They just, you know, churn them out and don't check them.
Bmr019	1158.040	1158.657	me013	Um.
Bmr019	1160.087	1160.780	me013	So.
Bmr019	1162.760	1171.310	me013	So that was - Yeah. So that was i- interesting result. So like I said, the front-end guys are very much interested in - in this is as - as well and
Bmr019	1171.038	1184.745	mn017	So - so, but where is this now? I mean, what's - where do we go from here? I mean, we - so we have a - we have a - a system that works pretty well but it's not, you know, the system that people here are used to using - to working with. So what - what do we do now?
Bmr019	1174.821	1176.696	me011	Yeah. That was gonna be my question.
Bmr019	1183.588	1193.409	me013	Well, I think what we wanna do is we want to - eh, and we've talked about this in other contexts - we want to have the ability to feed it different features.
Bmr019	1193.843	1195.014	mn017	Mm-hmm. O_K.
Bmr019	1194.369	1201.061	me013	And then, um, from the point of view of the front-end research, it would be s- uh, substituting for H_T_K.
Bmr019	1201.185	1201.776	mn017	O_K.
Bmr019	1202.162	1208.123	me013	I think that's the key thing. And then if we can feed it different features, then we can try all the different things that we're trying there.
Bmr019	1203.291	1204.041	mn017	O_K.
Bmr019	1207.709	1208.203	mn017	Alright.
Bmr019	1208.123	1224.747	me013	And then, um, uh, also Dave is - is thinking about using the data in different ways, uh, to um, uh, explicitly work on reverberation starting with some techniques that some other people have found somewhat useful, and - Yeah.
Bmr019	1214.782	1215.432	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1223.122	1223.665	mn017	O_K.
Bmr019	1224.060	1234.460	mn017	So - so the key thing that's missing here is basically the ability to feed, you know, other features i- into the recognizer and also then to train the system.
Bmr019	1232.825	1233.249	me013	Right.
Bmr019	1234.418	1234.853	me013	Right.
Bmr019	1235.461	1241.260	mn017	O_K. And, uh, es- I don't know when Chuck will be back but that's exactly what he - he's gonna -
Bmr019	1238.591	1239.362	me013	H- h-
Bmr019	1239.362	1245.680	me013	He's - he's sort of back, but he drove for fourteen hours an- and wasn't gonna make it in today.
Bmr019	1242.840	1244.641	mn017	Oh, O_K. So,
Bmr019	1245.386	1249.084	mn017	I think that's one of the things that he said he would be working on. Um.
Bmr019	1250.610	1253.562	mn017	Just sort of t- to make sure that we can do that and -
Bmr019	1250.760	1251.143	me011	Yeah.
Bmr019	1253.507	1253.995	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	1254.283	1255.062	mn017	Um.
Bmr019	1260.537	1260.938	me013	Right.
Bmr019	1261.493	1294.424	mn017	It's - uh, I mean, the - the front-end is f- i- tha- that's in the S_R_I recognizer is very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly but it unfortunately is not designed and, um - like the, uh, ICSI system is, where you can feed it from a pipeline of - of the command. So, the - what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to, uh, dump out, um - you know, if you want to use some new features, you have to dump them into individual files and give those files to the recognizer.
Bmr019	1294.010	1295.499	me011	We do - we tend to do that anyway.
Bmr019	1295.500	1296.309	mn017	O_K.
Bmr019	1296.307	1304.642	me011	Oh. So, although you - you can pipe it as well, we tend to do it that way because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep re-doing it over and over.
Bmr019	1303.989	1304.721	mn017	Oh, O_K.
Bmr019	1307.308	1307.808	mn017	Alright.
Bmr019	1307.414	1307.861	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	1309.115	1310.223	me013	Yeah. So I've - I -
Bmr019	1309.790	1313.460	me011	So tha- that's exactly what the P_file is for.
Bmr019	1312.972	1313.744	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	1313.230	1324.629	mn017	Yeah, the - the - the cumbersome thing is - is, um - is that you actually have to dump out little - little files. So for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out a separate file.
Bmr019	1313.846	1314.262	fe016	Uh -
Bmr019	1324.440	1325.440	me011	Uh-huh.
Bmr019	1325.530	1331.387	mn017	Just like i- th- like th- as if there were these waveform segments, but instead you have sort of feature file segments.
Bmr019	1333.155	1335.125	mn017	But, you know -
Bmr019	1336.050	1338.028	mn017	So.
Bmr019	1339.050	1340.086	me013	Cool.
Bmr019	1340.086	1344.161	me013	O_K. So the s- the - the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments?
Bmr019	1344.922	1345.532	fe016	Oh.
Bmr019	1346.224	1347.525	fe016	Yes, we have -
Bmr019	1348.237	1350.096	fe016	I don't know, did you wanna talk about it, or - ?
Bmr019	1350.096	1352.944	fe016	I can give a - I was just telling this to Jane and - and -
Bmr019	1353.300	1375.296	fe016	W- we - we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring and um, some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition, which is a um,
Bmr019	1375.672	1387.647	fe016	I think was both a - a pruning problem and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations. And so we tried both of these st- things. We tried saying -
Bmr019	1388.329	1396.439	fe016	I don't know, I got this whacky idea that - just from looking at the data, that when people talk their words are usually chunked together.
Bmr019	1397.237	1401.030	fe016	It's not that they say one word and then there's a bunch of words together.
Bmr019	1401.030	1405.002	fe016	They're might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels?
Bmr019	1405.002	1413.645	fe016	But in general, if there's, like, five or six words and one word's far away from it, that's probably wrong on average. So, um -
Bmr019	1414.484	1418.917	fe016	And then also, ca- the pruning, of course, was too - too severe.
Bmr019	1417.869	1422.595	mn017	So that's actually interesting. The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition.
Bmr019	1423.208	1432.219	mn017	And we had lowered that - we had used tighter pruning after Liz ran some experiments showing that, you know, it runs slower and there's no real difference in -
Bmr019	1431.138	1432.008	me011	No gain.
Bmr019	1431.293	1435.800	fe016	Actually it was better with - slightly better or about th- it was the same with tighter pruning.
Bmr019	1433.610	1434.088	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	1434.964	1439.318	mn017	So for free recognition, this - the lower pruning value is better. You -
Bmr019	1438.987	1445.693	fe016	It's probably cuz the recognition's just bad en- at a point where it's bad enough that - that you don't lose anything.
Bmr019	1442.087	1442.502	mn017	Correct.
Bmr019	1443.544	1444.090	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	1444.958	1452.488	mn017	Um, but it turned out for - for - to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly.
Bmr019	1451.168	1451.702	fe016	Right.
Bmr019	1452.289	1452.744	me013	Hmm.
Bmr019	1452.488	1460.362	mn017	Um because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment, um, in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker.
Bmr019	1460.379	1461.057	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1461.179	1484.116	mn017	Um, so that was one big factor that helped improve things and then the other thing was that, you know, as Liz said the - we f- enforce the fact that, uh, the foreground speech has to be continuous. It cannot be - you cannot have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech. You can only have background speech at the beginning and the end.
Bmr019	1484.370	1507.910	fe016	Yeah. I mean, yeah, it isn't always true, and I think what we really want is some clever way to do this, where, um, you know, from the data or from maybe some hand-corrected alignments from transcribers that things like words that do occur just by themselves a- alone, like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it - those would be able to do that, but the rest would be constrained.
Bmr019	1501.363	1501.831	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	1504.404	1513.949	fe008	Sorry.
Bmr019	1508.634	1514.929	fe016	So, I think we have a version that's pretty good for the native speakers. I don't know yet about the non-native speakers.
Bmr019	1515.641	1523.822	fe016	And, um, we basically also made noise models for the different - sort of grouped some of the mouth noises together.
Bmr019	1524.385	1526.917	fe016	Um, so, and then there's a background speech model.
Bmr019	1527.434	1528.364	fe016	And we also -
Bmr019	1528.364	1542.304	fe016	<find_calendar_entry> There was some neat - or, interesting cases, like there's one <entry_type> meeting </entry_type> where, um, Jose's giving a presentation and he's talking about, um, the word "mixed signal" and someone didn't understand, uh, that you were saying " mixed " - </find_calendar_entry>
Bmr019	1542.304	1543.036	fe016	I think, Morgan.
Bmr019	1542.360	1544.355	mn005	Yeah, yeah.
Bmr019	1543.438	1557.879	fe016	And so your speech -ch was s- saying something about mixed signal. And the next turn was a lot of people saying "mixed", like "he means mixed signal" or "I think it's mixed". And the word "mixed" in this segment occurs, like, a bunch of times.
Bmr019	1554.959	1555.695	mn005	Sh-
Bmr019	1558.331	1568.667	fe016	And Chuck's on the lapel here, and he also says "mixed" but it's at the last one, and of course the aligner th- aligns it everywhere else to everybody else's "mixed", cuz there's no adaptation yet. So there's -
Bmr019	1564.847	1566.730	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr019	1569.023	1571.188	fe016	I think there's some issues about - u-
Bmr019	1571.188	1593.456	fe016	We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker. But, I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker, and that's actually a little bit of a f- funky model. Like, it gives you some weird alignments, just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker. So there's some things there, especially when you get lots of the same words, uh, occurring in the -
Bmr019	1584.529	1585.281	mn017	Oh -
Bmr019	1587.626	1588.062	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	1587.858	1588.860	mn005	Oh.
Bmr019	1592.369	1592.962	mn017	Well, the -
Bmr019	1593.652	1598.958	mn017	I - I think you can do better by uh, cloning - so we have a reject phone.
Bmr019	1599.393	1617.710	mn017	And you - and what we wanted to try with - you know, once we have this paper written and have a little more time, uh, t- cloning that reject model and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground, like fragments and stuff, and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker.
Bmr019	1618.396	1620.396	fe016	Right. I mean, in general we actually -
Bmr019	1618.970	1619.474	mn017	And -
Bmr019	1620.396	1638.600	fe016	Right now the words like partial words are reject models and you normally allow those to match to any word. But then the background speech was also a reject model, and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between - you know, it needs to differentiate between the two. So just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues.
Bmr019	1624.332	1624.905	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1634.941	1635.388	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	1639.167	1641.445	fe016	And another one is turns, like people starting with
Bmr019	1641.445	1653.038	fe016	"well I think" and someone else is "well how about". So the word "well" is in this - in this segment multiple times, and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it.
Bmr019	1653.424	1660.617	fe016	But then that constraint of sort of - uh, proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general.
Bmr019	1659.739	1665.430	me011	Is the proximity constraint a hard constraint, or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance, or - ?
Bmr019	1663.632	1665.841	mn017	We - we didn't - No. We - w-
Bmr019	1663.860	1667.479	fe016	Right now it's a kluge.
Bmr019	1666.269	1673.350	mn017	O_K. We - it's straightforward to actually just have a - a penalty that doesn't completely disallows it but discourages it.
Bmr019	1673.775	1679.050	mn017	But, um, we just didn't have time to play with, you know, tuning yet another - yet another parameter.
Bmr019	1676.829	1678.411	me011	The ve- level. Yeah.
Bmr019	1678.496	1679.167	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	1679.050	1692.817	mn017	And really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have a - we don't have ground truth for these. So, we would need a hand-marked, um, word-level alignments or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech betw- you know, between the speakers.
Bmr019	1693.290	1701.490	mn017	Um, and then use that as a reference and tune the parameters of the - of the model, uh, to op- to get the best performance.
Bmr019	1700.412	1701.008	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	1700.772	1707.220	me013	G- given - I - I mean, I wa- I wa- I was gonna ask you anyway, uh, how you assessed that things were better.
Bmr019	1703.140	1703.879	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1707.572	1711.767	fe016	I looked at them. I spent two days - um, in Waves -
Bmr019	1708.901	1709.356	me013	O_K.
Bmr019	1711.767	1716.989	fe016	Oh, it was painful because the thing is, you know the alignments share a lot in common, so -
Bmr019	1716.989	1721.671	fe016	And you're - yo- you're looking at these segments where there's a lot of speech. I mean, a lot of them have a lot of words.
Bmr019	1721.709	1722.160	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	1722.045	1725.150	fe016	Not by every speaker but by some speaker there's a lot of words.
Bmr019	1724.793	1725.107	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	1724.955	1727.810	mn005	Ju-
Bmr019	1725.150	1736.152	fe016	No, not - I mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words, but altogether you'll see a lot of words up there. And so the reject is also mapping and pauses -
Bmr019	1728.877	1729.688	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	1730.839	1731.611	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1731.123	1731.473	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	1733.473	1733.852	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	1736.646	1746.447	fe016	So I looked at them all in Waves and just lined up all the alignments, and, at first it sort of looked like a mess and then the more I looked at it, I thought "O_K, well it's moving these words leftward and -"
Bmr019	1746.724	1769.195	fe016	You know, it wasn't that bad. It was just doing certain things wrong. So - But, I don't, you know, have time to l- to look at all of them and it would be really useful to have, like, a - a transcriber who could use Waves, um, just mark, like, the beginning and end of the foreground speaker's real words - like, the beginning of the first word, the end of the last word - and then we could, you know, do some adjustments.
Bmr019	1765.507	1766.515	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr019	1766.515	1776.524	fe008	I - O_K. I have to ask you something, which is, first of all, um, is i- does it have to be Waves? Because if we could benefit from what you did, incorporate that into the present transcripts, that would help.
Bmr019	1772.340	1773.132	mn017	No.
Bmr019	1776.524	1780.361	fe008	And then, um, the other thing is, I believe that I did hand-
Bmr019	1780.361	1791.226	fe008	So. One of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber and then I hand-marked it myself so that we do have, uh, the beginning and ending of individual utterances.
Bmr019	1791.328	1791.820	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1791.652	1811.369	fe008	Um, I didn't do it word level, but - but in terms - So I - so for - for one of the N_S_ A groups. And also I went back to the original one that I first transcribed and - and did it w- uh, w- uh, utterance by utterance for that particular one. So I think you do have - if that's a sufficient unit, I think that you do have hand-marking for that. But it'd be wonderful to be able to benefit from your Waves stuff.
Bmr019	1794.207	1794.678	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1809.396	1809.832	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1809.850	1812.263	mn017	We don't care what - what tool you use.
Bmr019	1812.299	1814.514	fe008	O_K. I used it in Transcriber and it's - it's in the -
Bmr019	1812.343	1834.965	fe016	Yeah. I mean, if - if you can, um - if you wanna - well, Jane and I were - just in terms of the tool, talking about this. I guess Sue had had some reactions. You know, interface-wise if you're looking at speech, you wanna be able to know really where the words are. And so, we can give you some examples of sort of what this output looks like, um, and see if you can in- maybe incorporate it into the Transcriber tool some way, or -
Bmr019	1812.639	1813.410	mn017	U- uh -
Bmr019	1824.599	1826.713	fe008	Yeah, that's right. Middle of the word, or -
Bmr019	1834.728	1845.631	fe008	Well, I th- I'm thinking just ch- e- e- incorporating it into the representation. I mean, if it's - if it's - if you have start points, if you have, like, time tags, which is what I assume. Isn't that what - what you - ? Well, see, Adam would be -
Bmr019	1835.971	1836.790	fe016	Um.
Bmr019	1838.544	1840.651	fe016	You mean like - Yeah, word start insights.
Bmr019	1841.691	1842.410	fe016	Right.
Bmr019	1844.846	1853.062	mn017	Yeah, whatever you use. I mean, we convert it to this format that the, um, NIST scoring tool unders- uh, C_T_M.
Bmr019	1846.053	1846.621	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	1853.062	1857.520	mn017	Conversation Time-Marked file. And - and then that's the - that's what the -
Bmr019	1857.170	1860.000	me011	I think Transcriber, uh, outputs C_T_M.
Bmr019	1860.495	1862.089	fe008	If it - ? O_K. So you would know this more than I would.
Bmr019	1860.941	1861.940	me011	I think so.
Bmr019	1861.260	1862.808	fe016	Yeah. So, I mean -
Bmr019	1861.456	1862.294	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	1862.089	1871.091	fe008	It seems like she - if she's g- if she's moving time marks around, since our representation in Transcriber uses time marks, it seems like there should be some way of - of using that - benefitting from that.
Bmr019	1867.683	1868.177	me011	Right.
Bmr019	1870.219	1882.400	fe016	Yeah, it wou- the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able - if you were zoomed in enough in Transcriber to see all the words, you would be able to, like, have the words sort of located in time, if you wanted to do that. So.
Bmr019	1875.945	1876.562	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1880.637	1886.810	me013	So - so if we e- e- even just had a - a - It sounds like w- we - we almost do.
Bmr019	1886.810	1888.397	me013	Uh, if we - We have two. Yeah.
Bmr019	1887.011	1887.871	fe008	We have two.
Bmr019	1888.397	1897.123	me013	Just ha- uh, trying out the alignment procedure that you have on that you could actually get something, um - uh, uh, get an objective measure.
Bmr019	1892.316	1892.717	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1897.495	1898.182	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	1897.936	1898.707	me013	Uh -
Bmr019	1898.896	1901.086	fe016	You mean on - on the hand-marked, um -
Bmr019	1901.086	1908.525	fe016	So we - we only r- hav- I only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose, I think M_R four, just randomly, um -
Bmr019	1901.556	1902.290	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	1909.620	1910.220	fe016	And -
Bmr019	1910.610	1915.338	mn017	Actually, not randomly. We knew - we knew that it had these insertion errors from - Yeah.
Bmr019	1911.596	1912.793	fe016	Not randomly -
Bmr019	1913.294	1918.914	fe016	<find_calendar_entry> It had sort of average recognition performance in a bunch of speakers and it was a <title> Meeting Recorder </title> <entry_type> meeting </entry_type> </find_calendar_entry>.
Bmr019	1915.736	1916.550	mn017	Yeah.
Bmr019	1918.914	1924.582	fe016	Um. But, yeah, we should try to use what you have. I did re-run recognition on your new version of
Bmr019	1924.638	1926.715	fe008	Oh, good. Good!
Bmr019	1925.144	1929.634	fe016	M_R one. I - I mean the - the one with <contact_name> Dan Ellis </contact_name> in it and <contact_name> Eric </contact_name>.
Bmr019	1927.506	1929.147	fe008	Uh-huh. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah.
Bmr019	1929.576	1932.160	me001	I don't think that was the new version.
Bmr019	1930.405	1930.781	fe016	Um -
Bmr019	1931.144	1938.954	fe016	That - Yeah, actually it wasn't the new new, it was the medium new. But - but we would - we should do the - the latest version. It was the one from last week.
Bmr019	1932.545	1933.052	fe008	O_K.
Bmr019	1933.796	1934.251	fe008	O_K.
Bmr019	1936.030	1942.650	me001	Yeah. You - did you adjust the - the utterance times, um, for each channel?
Bmr019	1940.837	1941.549	fe008	Yes.
Bmr019	1942.569	1954.013	fe008	Yes, I did. And furthermore, I found that there were a certain number where - not - not a lot, but several times I actually moved an utterance from Adam's channel to Dan's or from Dan's to Adam's. So there was some speaker identif-
Bmr019	1954.013	1967.724	fe008	And the reason was because I transcribed that at a point before - uh, before we had the multiple audio available f- so I couldn't switch between the audio. I - I transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely, which meant in overlaps, I was at a - at a terrific disadvantage.
Bmr019	1966.637	1968.261	fe016	Right. Right.
Bmr019	1967.724	1977.541	fe008	In addition it was before the channelized, uh, possibility was there. And finally I did it using the speakers of my, um - of - you know, off the C_P_U on my - on my machine cuz I didn't have a headphone.
Bmr019	1977.541	1978.444	fe008	So it  , like, I mean -
Bmr019	1977.749	1978.422	fe016	Right.
Bmr019	1978.444	1983.490	fe008	Yeah, I - I mean, i- in retrospect it would've been good to ha- have got- I should've gotten a headphone.
Bmr019	1983.490	1998.149	fe008	But in any case, um, thi- this is - this was transcribed in a - in a, uh, less optimal way than - than the ones that came after it, and I was able to - you know, an- and this meant that there were some speaker identif- identifications which were changes. Yeah.
Bmr019	1995.773	2000.204	me001	Well, I know there were some speaker labeling problems, um, after interruptions. Is that what you're referring to?
Bmr019	1998.572	1999.343	fe008	Fixed that.
Bmr019	1999.778	2001.249	fe008	Oh, well -
Bmr019	2000.204	2004.532	me001	I mean, cuz there's this one instance when, for example, you're running down the stairs. I remember this meeting really well.
Bmr019	2004.260	2005.132	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	2004.436	2010.147	fe016	Don - Don has had - He knows - he can just read it like a play.
Bmr019	2004.532	2005.843	me001	Right. It's a -
Bmr019	2005.843	2008.739	me001	Yeah, I've - I've - I'm very well acquainted with this meeting.
Bmr019	2008.950	2009.840	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	2009.146	2010.669	me001	Yeah, I can s-
Bmr019	2010.147	2011.870	fe016	"And then she said, and then he said."
Bmr019	2010.986	2017.633	me001	Yeah, I know it by heart. So, um, there's one point when you're running down the stairs. Right? And, like, there's an interruption.
Bmr019	2015.033	2016.675	fe008	Uh-oh.
Bmr019	2017.633	2023.312	me001	You interrupt somebody, but then there's no line after that. For example, there's no speaker identification after that line.
Bmr019	2022.214	2022.807	fe008	Uh-huh.
Bmr019	2023.678	2027.349	me001	Is that what you're talking about? Or were there mislabelings as far as, like, the a- Adam was - ?
Bmr019	2026.961	2032.726	fe008	That was fixed, um, before - i- i- i- I think I- I think I understood that pretty - Thank you for mentioning. Yeah, no, tha- that -
Bmr019	2029.643	2032.313	me001	Yeah. Cuz I thought I let you know about that. Yeah.
Bmr019	2032.726	2036.129	fe008	That I think went away a couple of versions ago, but it's good to know.
Bmr019	2034.509	2038.210	me001	O_K. But you're actually saying that certain, uh, speakers were mis- mis-identified.
Bmr019	2037.039	2043.034	fe008	Yeah. So, with - under - um, uh, listening to the mixed channel, there were times when, as surprising as that is,
Bmr019	2043.034	2058.420	fe008	I got Adam's voice confused with Dan's and vice versa - not for long utterances, but jus- just a couple of places, and embedde- embedded in overlaps. The other thing that was w- interesting to me was that I picked up a lot of, um, backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal, which, you know, I mean, you c- not - not too surprising.
Bmr019	2044.199	2044.931	me001	O_K.
Bmr019	2046.070	2046.543	me001	O_K.
Bmr019	2046.912	2047.564	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	2048.882	2049.439	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2056.866	2057.576	fe016	Right.
Bmr019	2058.420	2059.803	fe008	But the other thing that -
Bmr019	2059.803	2066.983	fe008	I - I hadn't thought about this, but I thou- I wanted to raise this when you were - uh, with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially, but that's -
Bmr019	2067.754	2082.985	fe008	When I was looking at these backchannels, they were turning up usually - very often in - w- well, I won't say "usually" - but anyway, very often, I picked them up in a channel w- which was the person who had asked a question. S- so, like, someone says "an- and have you done the so-and-so?"
Bmr019	2083.424	2088.321	fe008	And then there would be backchannels, but it would be the person who asked the question. Other people weren't really doing much backchanneling.
Bmr019	2088.321	2090.771	fe008	And, you know, sometimes you have the - Yeah, uh-huh.
Bmr019	2089.510	2090.855	fe016	Well, that's interesting.
Bmr019	2090.771	2100.622	fe008	I mean, i- it wouldn't be perfect, but - but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when - when you're somehow involved in the topic, and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question.
Bmr019	2091.363	2092.002	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	2093.354	2094.986	fe016	No, that's really interesting.
Bmr019	2097.390	2097.998	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2099.415	2100.028	mn017	Well,
Bmr019	2100.888	2102.389	fe016	That's interesting.
Bmr019	2100.950	2111.580	mn017	I think - No. I think it's - actually I think what's going on is backchanneling is something that happens in two-party conversations. And if you ask someone a question, you essentially initiating a little two-party conversation.
Bmr019	2107.042	2107.537	fe008	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2110.821	2111.237	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr019	2111.488	2113.506	fe016	Well, actu- Yeah, when we looked at this -
Bmr019	2111.930	2117.393	mn017	So then you're - so and then you're expected to backchannel because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody.
Bmr019	2111.988	2112.779	fe008	Exactly.
Bmr019	2115.390	2117.052	fe008	Exactly.
Bmr019	2117.052	2130.863	fe008	Exactly my point. An- and so this is the expectation thing that - uh, uh, just the dyadic - But in addition, you know, if someone has done this analysis himself and isn't involved in the dyad, but they might also give backchannels to verify what - what the answer is that this - that the - the answerer's given -
Bmr019	2117.781	2119.230	mn017	Yeah. Yeah. Right.
Bmr019	2118.590	2119.065	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2119.745	2120.482	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	2121.555	2122.168	me013	H-
Bmr019	2129.811	2139.207	me013	I tell you, I say - I say "uh-huh" a lot, while people are talking to each other.
Bmr019	2129.845	2131.065	fe016	Right. It's -
Bmr019	2131.474	2131.989	fe008	There you go.
Bmr019	2131.740	2134.340	fe016	Well, but it's interesting cuz, uh -
Bmr019	2134.620	2137.206	fe008	There you go. Yeah. Yeah.
Bmr019	2135.386	2144.954	fe016	But there are fewer - I think there are fewer "uh-huhs". I mean, just from - We were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between in doing the alignment.
Bmr019	2145.170	2147.575	fe016	You know the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words.
Bmr019	2145.250	2146.225	fe008	Oh, yeah.
Bmr019	2148.260	2148.913	fe016	And
Bmr019	2149.770	2171.507	fe016	"uh-huh" is not as frequent as it sort of would be in Switchboard, if you looked at just a word frequency list of one-word short utterances. And " yeah " is way up there, but not "uh-huh". And so I was thinking thi- it's not like you're being encouraged by everybody else to keep talking in the meeting. And uh, that's all, I- I'll stop there, cuz I- I think what you say makes a lot of sense. But it was sort of -
Bmr019	2168.062	2169.327	fe008	Well, that's right. And that would -
Bmr019	2169.327	2170.614	fe008	Well, an-
Bmr019	2170.614	2180.227	fe008	And what you say is the - is the re- uh, o- other side of this, which is that, you know, so th- there are lots of channels where you don't have these backchannels, w- when a question has been asked and - and these -
Bmr019	2179.399	2209.714	fe016	Right. There's just probably less backchanneling in general, even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting, but we'll find out anyway. We were - I guess the other thing we're - we're - I should say is that we're gonna, um try - compare this type of overlap analysis to Switchboard, where - and CallHome, where we have both sides, so that we can try to answer this question of, you know, is there really more overlap in meetings or is it just because we don't have the other channel in Switchboard and we don't know what people are doing.
Bmr019	2180.227	2180.801	fe008	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2182.256	2183.542	fe008	So that's good news, really.
Bmr019	2198.896	2199.786	mn017	And CallHome.
Bmr019	2201.308	2201.856	me011	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2201.332	2202.206	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2209.714	2211.494	fe016	Try to create a paper out of that.
Bmr019	2211.620	2218.782	me013	Yeah. I mean, y- y- you folks have probably already told me, but were - were you intending to do a Eurospeech submission, or - ?
Bmr019	2218.526	2221.236	fe016	Um, you mean the one due tomorrow?
Bmr019	2221.294	2222.402	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	2221.928	2228.080	fe016	Yeah. Well, we're still, like, writing the scripts for doing the research, and we will - Yes, we're gonna try.
Bmr019	2226.388	2226.962	fe008	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2229.187	2234.837	fe016	And I was telling Don, do not take this as an example of how people should work.
Bmr019	2233.240	2238.724	me013	Do as I say, don't do as I do. Yeah.
Bmr019	2235.082	2237.090	me001	That's r-
Bmr019	2235.380	2240.181	fe016	So, we will try. It'll probably be a little late, but I'm gonna try it.
Bmr019	2237.165	2237.919	me011	Well -
Bmr019	2239.000	2243.926	me011	It is different. In previous years, Eurospeech only had the abstract due by now, not the full paper.
Bmr019	2243.248	2243.790	me001	Right.
Bmr019	2243.729	2244.203	fe016	Right.
Bmr019	2244.340	2250.512	me011	And so all our timing was off. I've given up on trying to do digits. I just don't think that what I have so far makes a Eurospeech paper.
Bmr019	2251.088	2261.672	fe016	Well, I'm no- We may be in the same position, and I figured we'll try, because that'll at least get us to the point where we have - We have this really nice database format that Andreas and I were working out that -
Bmr019	2261.983	2263.898	fe016	It - it's not very fancy. It's just a
Bmr019	2264.323	2267.490	fe016	ASCII line by line format, but it does give you information -
Bmr019	2266.650	2269.710	mn017	It's the - it's the spurt format.
Bmr019	2269.000	2275.514	fe016	It - Yeah, we're calling these "spurts" after Chafe. I was trying to find what's a word for a continuous region with pauses around it?
Bmr019	2272.124	2272.658	fe008	Hmm.
Bmr019	2275.543	2280.065	me013	Yeah. I know that th- the Telecom people use - use "spurt" for that. Yes.
Bmr019	2275.571	2275.993	fe008	Good.
Bmr019	2278.747	2281.589	fe016	They do? Oh! Oh. I would jus-
Bmr019	2279.239	2279.773	mn017	Oh.
Bmr019	2280.065	2297.544	me013	And that's - I mean, I - I was using that for a while when I was doing the rate of speech stuff, because I - because I looked up in some books and I found - O_K, I wanna find a spurt in which - and - an- because - cuz it's another question about how many pauses they put in between them. But how fast do they do the words within the spurt? Yeah.
Bmr019	2283.828	2285.012	fe016	Ah, right!
Bmr019	2287.384	2289.661	fe016	It's just, like, defined by the acoustics.
Bmr019	2291.190	2292.218	me011	Horrible.
Bmr019	2292.515	2293.111	fe016	Right.
Bmr019	2296.624	2299.789	me001	you know " Burst " also? Isn't "burst" is used also?
Bmr019	2296.649	2300.605	fe016	Right. Well, that's what we were calling spurt, so -
Bmr019	2297.091	2299.320	me011	It's gonna - Burst.
Bmr019	2300.520	2307.000	me011	Spurt has the horrible name overloading with other - with hardware at ICSI.
Bmr019	2303.329	2307.425	mn005	Here  -
Bmr019	2303.879	2306.998	me013	Here. Just very locally, yeah. But - but that just -
Bmr019	2306.000	2311.030	fe016	Well, well, Chafe had this wor- I think it was Chafe, or somebody had a - the word "spurt" originally, and so I -
Bmr019	2311.488	2312.073	fe008	Actually -
Bmr019	2311.554	2314.074	fe016	But tha- that's good to know. Was thi- it's Chafe?
Bmr019	2313.465	2319.241	fe008	Well, see, I know S- Sue wrote about spurts of development. But, in any case, I think it's a good term, and, uh -
Bmr019	2313.480	2314.778	mn017	So maybe we should talk -
Bmr019	2315.201	2316.784	fe016	Maybe it was Sue - ? Y-
Bmr019	2318.242	2318.735	me011	Hmm!
Bmr019	2318.544	2322.737	fe016	So we have spurts and we have spurt-ify dot shell and spurt-ify
Bmr019	2318.663	2319.199	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	2321.358	2324.433	fe008	And ma- maybe - maybe Chafe did. I know - I know Ch- Chafe dealt with -
Bmr019	2321.590	2322.519	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	2321.622	2323.303	mn017	Uh. So s-
Bmr019	2321.662	2323.998	me001	That's cool.
Bmr019	2322.737	2325.730	fe016	And then it's got all - it's a verb now.
Bmr019	2324.272	2325.795	mn017	W- uh, w-
Bmr019	2324.927	2326.688	fe008	Chafe speaks about intonation units.
Bmr019	2326.684	2327.564	fe016	Yes. Right.
Bmr019	2326.688	2329.714	fe008	But maybe he speaks about spurts as well and I just don't know. Yeah, go ahead.
Bmr019	2327.452	2327.926	mn017	We-
Bmr019	2329.160	2335.404	mn017	So what we're doing - uh, this - this is just - maybe someone has s- some - some ideas about how to do it better, but we -
Bmr019	2329.438	2331.060	me011	I've heard "burst" also.
Bmr019	2330.809	2331.403	me001	Mmm.
Bmr019	2335.960	2338.798	mn017	So we're taking these, uh, alignments from the individual channels.
Bmr019	2339.497	2349.067	mn017	We're - from each alignment we're producing, uh, one of these C_T_M files, which essentially has - it's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration.
Bmr019	2344.291	2344.730	fe008	Great.
Bmr019	2350.100	2351.660	mn017	And - and - and of course -
Bmr019	2350.555	2353.568	fe016	It looks like a Waves label file almost. Right? It's just -
Bmr019	2352.672	2358.806	mn017	Right. But it has - one - the first column has the meeting name, so it could actually contain several meetings. Um.
Bmr019	2359.332	2360.704	mn017	And the second column is the channel.
Bmr019	2361.456	2366.566	mn017	Third column is the, um, start times of the words and the fourth column is the duration of the words.
Bmr019	2367.492	2370.600	mn017	And then we're, um -
Bmr019	2371.942	2386.530	mn017	O_K. Then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of words the, uh, tags for, like, where - where sentence - ends of sentence, question marks, um, various other things. Uh.
Bmr019	2385.547	2409.380	fe016	Yeah. These are things that we had Don - So, Don sort of, um, propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber - so whether it was, like, question mark or period or, um, you know, comma and things like that, and we kept the - and disfluency dashes - uh, kept those in because we sort of wanna know where those are relative to the spurt overlaps - sp- overlaps, or -
Bmr019	2388.150	2389.144	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	2400.300	2400.725	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2406.533	2410.582	mn017	Right. So - so those are actually sort of retro-fitted into the time alignment.
Bmr019	2411.390	2416.498	mn017	And then we merge all the alignments from the various channels and we sort them by time.
Bmr019	2418.515	2425.486	mn017	And then there's a - then there's a process where you now determine the spurts.
Bmr019	2426.063	2426.809	mn017	That is -
Bmr019	2426.809	2439.448	mn017	Actually, no, you do that before you merge the various channels. So you - you id- identify by some criterion, which is pause length - you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts, and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight.
Bmr019	2437.790	2438.421	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2440.013	2444.810	mn017	And then you merge everything in terms of, you know, linearizing the sequence based on the time marks.
Bmr019	2445.410	2456.288	mn017	And then you extract the individual channels again, but this time you know where the other people start and end talking - you know, where their spurts start and end.
Bmr019	2457.163	2463.049	mn017	And so you extract the individual channels, uh, one sp- spurt by spurt as it were.
Bmr019	2463.049	2479.443	mn017	Um, and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end tags for overlaps. So, you - you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers' speech.
Bmr019	2478.767	2479.338	me011	Right.
Bmr019	2479.747	2501.993	fe016	Uh, I mean, I think that's actually really u- useful also because even if you weren't studying overlaps, if you wanna get a transcription for the far-field mikes, how are you gonna know which words from which speakers occurred at which times relative to each other? You have to be able to get a transcript like - like this anyway, just for doing far-field recognition. So, you know, it's - it's sort of -
Bmr019	2479.880	2480.509	mn017	And -
Bmr019	2500.793	2501.382	mn017	Yeah.
Bmr019	2502.411	2507.199	fe016	I thi- it's just an issue we haven't dealt with before, how you time-align things that are overlapping anyway.
Bmr019	2508.508	2509.457	fe008	That's wonderful.
Bmr019	2508.540	2509.057	mn017	So -
Bmr019	2509.107	2509.640	me011	Well -
Bmr019	2509.457	2510.292	mn017	And - and we -
Bmr019	2509.533	2511.756	fe016	I mean, i- I never thought about it before, but -
Bmr019	2510.986	2520.690	me011	Y- yes. I mean, s- when I came up with the original data - suggested data format based on the transcription graph, there's capability of doing that sort of thing in there.
Bmr019	2511.204	2511.569	mn017	In -
Bmr019	2520.022	2528.525	fe016	Right. But you can't get it directly from the transcription. Yeah, this is like a poor man's ver- formatting version. But it's, you know - It's clean, it's just not fancy.
Bmr019	2520.629	2521.520	fe008	Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right.
Bmr019	2520.750	2523.111	mn017	Right. Well, this is - this is just -
Bmr019	2528.370	2545.873	mn017	Well, there's lots of little things. It's like there're twelve different scripts which you run and then at the end you have what you want. But, um, at the very last stage we throw away the actual time information. All we care about is whether - that there's a certain word was overlapped by someone else's word.
Bmr019	2528.430	2528.865	me011	Right.
Bmr019	2529.145	2529.757	fe016	Um.
Bmr019	2545.873	2551.429	mn017	So you sort of - at that point, you discretize things into just having overlap or no overlap.
Bmr019	2552.007	2556.804	mn017	Because we figure that's about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper.
Bmr019	2555.717	2556.350	me011	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2557.293	2567.490	mn017	But if you wanted to do a more fine-grained analysis and say, you know, how far into the word is the overlap, you could do that. It's just - it'll just require more - you know, slightly different -
Bmr019	2563.595	2567.540	fe016	Yeah. Just sort of huge.
Bmr019	2567.190	2578.486	fe008	What's interesting is it's exactly what, um, i- in discussing with, um, Sue about this, um, she, um, i- i- i- indicated that that - you know, that's very important for overlap analysis.
Bmr019	2568.279	2568.926	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	2577.369	2597.061	fe016	Yeah. It's - it's nice to know, and also I think as a human, like, I don't always hear these in the actual order that they occur. So I can have two foreground speakers, you know, Morgan an- and um, Adam and Jane could all be talking, and I could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time, and then look where they are relative to each other, and that's not really what I heard.
Bmr019	2577.458	2577.907	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	2597.090	2601.941	fe008	And that's another thing she said. This is - This is Bever's - Bever's effect, when - where -
Bmr019	2598.427	2599.910	fe016	Cuz it's just hard to do.
Bmr019	2601.301	2602.610	fe016	Y- Yeah. It's sort of -
Bmr019	2602.850	2608.646	fe008	In psy- ps- psycho-linguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases a- as to what they hear, that - that -
Bmr019	2607.605	2620.989	fe016	Yeah, you sort of move things around until you get to a low information point and yo- then you can bring in the other person. So it's actually not even possible, I think, for any person to listen to a mixed signal, even equalize, and make sure that they have all the words in the right order.
Bmr019	2609.364	2610.229	fe008	Not the best -
Bmr019	2621.258	2621.722	fe008	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2621.790	2627.782	fe016	So, I guess, we'll try to write this Eurospeech paper. I mean, we will write it. Whether they accept it late or not, I don't know.
Bmr019	2622.276	2623.069	fe008	Superb.
Bmr019	2628.455	2637.079	fe016	Um, and the good thing is that we have - It's sort of a beginning of what Don can use to link the prosodic features from each file to each other.
Bmr019	2635.904	2636.542	mn017	Yeah.
Bmr019	2637.236	2639.293	me013	Yeah. That's the good thing about these pape-
Bmr019	2637.981	2638.565	mn005	Hmm?
Bmr019	2638.023	2638.790	mn017	Plus, mayb-
Bmr019	2638.061	2643.837	fe016	So. i- You know, might as well. We- I ju- Otherwise we won't get the work done on our deadline.
Bmr019	2640.649	2641.421	mn017	I don't know, m-
Bmr019	2641.915	2648.537	mn017	I mean, u- u- Jane likes to look at data. Maybe, you know, you could - you could look at this format and see if you find anything interesting.
Bmr019	2642.319	2642.972	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	2648.537	2649.190	mn017	I don't know.
Bmr019	2648.929	2657.616	me013	Yeah. No, it's - that's the good thing about these pape- paper deadlines and, uh, you know, class projects, and - and things like that, because you - you really get g- Yeah.
Bmr019	2649.203	2650.746	fe008	Well, what I'm thinking is -
Bmr019	2649.861	2650.483	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	2649.862	2650.715	mn017	Yeah.
Bmr019	2650.983	2651.497	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr019	2653.470	2655.060	fe016	Right.
Bmr019	2653.520	2655.101	fe008	Well, my -
Bmr019	2653.538	2654.448	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2654.448	2676.571	mn017	Well th- th- the other thing that - that - that yo- that you usually don't tell your graduate students is that these deadlines are actually not that, um, you know, strictly enforced, because the - because - bec- b- Nah - i- Because these - the conference organizers actually have an interest in getting lots of submissions. I mean, a - a monetary interest. So -
Bmr019	2656.319	2656.734	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr019	2656.358	2658.750	fe016	Forces you to do the work. Exactly.
Bmr019	2661.768	2662.638	me011	Strict.
Bmr019	2663.762	2667.592	me013	Oh, now it's out in the public, this - this - this secret information. Yeah.
Bmr019	2665.277	2668.503	fe008	I think we can ha-
Bmr019	2665.417	2669.480	fe016	Right. So -
Bmr019	2667.527	2670.534	me011	No.
Bmr019	2667.592	2672.480	me013	No.
Bmr019	2668.503	2671.377	fe008	Nah.
Bmr019	2670.819	2672.370	fe016	Right.
Bmr019	2674.689	2675.202	me011	Right.
Bmr019	2675.578	2676.072	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	2677.287	2678.304	mn017	Um.
Bmr019	2677.852	2679.050	me013	Th- that's - that's true.
Bmr019	2677.993	2683.167	fe008	And good ones, good ones, which sometimes means a little extra time.
Bmr019	2679.050	2680.759	mn017	And good submission- Right. Well -
Bmr019	2679.494	2679.929	me013	That's -
Bmr019	2680.602	2681.175	me013	That's true.
Bmr019	2680.759	2682.820	mn017	That's another issue, but -
Bmr019	2682.204	2689.660	me013	By th- by the way, this is totally unfair, you may - you may feel, but the - the, uh - the morning meeting folks actually have an - an extra month or so.
Bmr019	2685.661	2686.116	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2689.580	2692.863	mn014	Yep.
Bmr019	2690.752	2693.738	me011	Yep. The Aurora - there's a special Aurora -
Bmr019	2691.536	2691.951	mn017	When -
Bmr019	2691.606	2692.160	fe016	Uh -
Bmr019	2693.172	2700.140	me013	There's a special Aurora session and the Aurora pe- people involved in Aurora have till Ma- uh, early May or something to turn in their paper.
Bmr019	2694.770	2695.308	fe016	Oh.
Bmr019	2694.773	2695.646	mn017	Mmm.
Bmr019	2695.992	2696.624	fe016	Oh.
Bmr019	2699.006	2699.576	mn017	Mmm.
Bmr019	2700.292	2701.162	mn017	Well, then you can just -
Bmr019	2700.561	2704.170	fe016	Oh, well maybe we'll submit to s- Actually -
Bmr019	2701.597	2705.635	mn017	Maybe you can submit the digits paper on e- for the Aurora session.
Bmr019	2702.083	2703.906	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr019	2703.742	2704.452	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	2704.170	2704.800	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	2704.696	2707.912	me011	Oh, I could! I could submit that to Aurora. That would be pretty - pretty -
Bmr019	2704.915	2706.051	me013	I- if it w-
Bmr019	2705.290	2706.016	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	2706.051	2708.704	me013	Well - i- it has -
Bmr019	2706.502	2707.096	mn017	Yeah.
Bmr019	2708.272	2709.081	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	2708.288	2710.422	me011	S- That wouldn't work. It's not Aurora.
Bmr019	2709.260	2713.657	me013	No, it wouldn't work. It's - it's not the Aurora - I mean, it - it's - it's actually the Aurora task.
Bmr019	2711.833	2712.980	fe016	Maybe they'll get s-
Bmr019	2712.103	2713.922	me011	Aurora's very specific.
Bmr019	2713.657	2713.958	me013	It-
Bmr019	2713.692	2718.307	fe016	Well, maybe it won't be after this deadline extension. Maybe they'll -
Bmr019	2714.874	2723.507	mn017	But - but the people - I mean, a - a paper that is not on Aurora would probably be more interesting at that point because everybody's so sick and tired of the Aurora task.
Bmr019	2723.249	2723.724	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	2723.323	2728.580	me011	Oh, I thought you meant this was just the digits section. I didn't know you meant it was Aurora digits.
Bmr019	2728.005	2728.604	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	2728.580	2733.697	mn017	Well, no. If you - if you have - it's to - if you discuss some relation to the Aurora task, like if you use the same -
Bmr019	2733.118	2735.017	me013	This is not the Aurora task.
Bmr019	2738.292	2746.630	me013	So they just do a little grep for -
Bmr019	2739.412	2740.282	fe016	Do - uh, d- d-
Bmr019	2740.114	2741.110	mn017	Um.
Bmr019	2740.282	2745.484	fe016	Do not - do not - we are not setting a good example. This is not a -
Bmr019	2741.840	2744.670	mn017	Well, a relation other than negation, maybe, um.
Bmr019	2745.310	2746.766	mn017	So. I don't know.
Bmr019	2746.117	2746.750	fe016	Anyway.
Bmr019	2747.383	2749.302	fe016	But the good thing is this does -
Bmr019	2747.651	2754.683	me011	Well, I- I don't know. I mean, you could - you could do a paper on what's wrong with the Aurora task by comparing it to other ways of doing it.
Bmr019	2753.940	2761.488	mn017	How well does an Aurora system do on - on - you know, on digits collected in a - in this environment? Yeah.
Bmr019	2759.989	2761.017	me011	Different way. Yeah.
Bmr019	2761.658	2762.293	me013	Maybe.
Bmr019	2762.377	2763.007	mn017	Maybe.
Bmr019	2763.499	2765.410	me011	Pretty hokey.
Bmr019	2764.390	2782.114	me013	I think it's a littl- little far-fetched. Nah, I mean, the thing is Aurora's pretty closed community. I mean, you know, the people who were involved in the - the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who - who made it above a certain threshold in the first round, uh w- in ninety-nine and it's - it's sort of a - it's - not like a -
Bmr019	2766.536	2767.054	me011	Yep.
Bmr019	2768.727	2769.710	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2771.159	2772.544	me011	It's very specific.
Bmr019	2781.001	2787.524	mn017	Well, that's maybe why they don't f- know that they have a crummy system. I mean, a crummy back-end.
Bmr019	2787.524	2790.963	mn017	No, I mean - I mean, seriously, if you - if you have a very -
Bmr019	2790.963	2791.892	mn017	No, I'm sorry.
Bmr019	2791.647	2794.902	fe016	Uh, "beep" "bee-"
Bmr019	2795.370	2800.631	mn017	No. I didn't mean anybody - any particular system. I meant this H_T_ K back-end. If they -
Bmr019	2795.790	2796.858	me011	I mean, th-
Bmr019	2800.433	2804.013	me013	Oh, you don't like H_T_K?
Bmr019	2801.679	2804.335	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr019	2803.542	2807.257	mn017	I don't h- I don't have any stock in H_T_K or Entropic or anything.
Bmr019	2804.784	2812.340	me013	No. I mean, this - it- it's the H_T_K that is trained on a very limited amount of data. Yeah.
Bmr019	2807.945	2809.648	me011	It's d- it's very specific.
Bmr019	2811.150	2811.461	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	2812.312	2813.448	mn017	But so, if you -
Bmr019	2814.072	2818.505	mn017	But maybe you should, you know, consider more - using more data, or - I mean -
Bmr019	2817.679	2819.809	me013	Oh, yeah. I - I really think that that's true.
Bmr019	2819.809	2822.499	me013	And they i- i- i-
Bmr019	2819.810	2824.835	mn017	If yo- if you sort of hermetically stay within one task and don't look left and right, then you're gonna -
Bmr019	2820.468	2821.516	me011	But they - they had -
Bmr019	2822.912	2823.313	me013	But -
Bmr019	2823.331	2826.128	me011	They had something very specific in mind when they designed it.
Bmr019	2826.117	2826.512	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	2826.534	2827.421	me013	Well, u- i-
Bmr019	2826.674	2833.300	me011	Right? And so - so you can - you can argue about maybe that wasn't the right thing to do, but, you know, they - they - they had something specific.
Bmr019	2831.420	2836.540	me013	But, one of the reasons I have Chuck's messing around with - with the back-end that you're not supposed to touch -
Bmr019	2836.453	2837.149	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2836.540	2840.052	me013	I mean, for the evaluations, yes, we'll run a version that hasn't been touched.
Bmr019	2838.001	2838.735	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2840.479	2855.006	me013	But, uh, one of the reasons I have him messing around with that, because I think it's sort of an open question that we don't know the answer to. People always say very glibly that i- if you s- show improvement on a bad system, that doesn't mean anything, cuz it may not be - show - uh, because, you know, it doesn't tell you anything about the good system.
Bmr019	2854.476	2855.226	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2855.006	2858.029	me013	And I - I've always sort of felt that that depends.
Bmr019	2858.490	2863.986	me013	You know, that if some peopl- If you're actually are getting at something that has some conceptual substance to it, it will port.
Bmr019	2858.574	2859.275	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2864.286	2870.808	me013	And in fact, most methods that people now use were originally tried with something that was not their absolute best system at some level.
Bmr019	2870.808	2899.000	me013	But of course, sometimes it doesn't, uh, port. So I think that's - that's an interesting question. If we're getting three percent error on, uh, u- uh, English, uh, nati- native speakers, um, using the Aurora system, and we do some improvements and bring it from three to two, do those same improvements bring, uh, th- you know, the S_R_I system from one point three to - you know, to point eight? Well. You know, so that's - that's something we can test.
Bmr019	2890.375	2891.600	mn017	Hmm.
Bmr019	2893.459	2894.033	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2894.050	2894.586	me011	Zero.
Bmr019	2896.201	2896.724	mn017	Mmm.
Bmr019	2898.186	2898.799	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	2899.704	2900.633	me013	So.
Bmr019	2900.633	2901.209	me013	Anyway.
Bmr019	2900.995	2901.885	mn017	O_K.
Bmr019	2901.209	2908.440	me013	I think we've - we've covered that one up extremely well.
Bmr019	2901.758	2902.173	fe008	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	2906.057	2906.492	mn017	Whew!
Bmr019	2908.440	2909.592	me013	O_K.
Bmr019	2909.592	2911.409	me013	So, um -
Bmr019	2912.404	2924.117	me013	Yeah. So tha- so we'll - you know, maybe you guys'll have - have one. Uh, you - you and, uh - and Dan have - have a paper that - that's going in. You know, that's - that's pretty solid, on the segmentation stuff.
Bmr019	2919.404	2920.751	mn014	Yeah. Yeah.
Bmr019	2922.698	2926.583	mn014	Yeah. I will send you the - the final version, which is not -
Bmr019	2924.748	2925.277	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	2925.717	2929.930	me013	And the Aurora folks here will - will definitely get something in on Aurora, so.
Bmr019	2927.969	2933.844	mn017	Actually this - this, um - So, there's another paper. It's a Eurospeech paper but not related to meetings.
Bmr019	2934.200	2942.143	mn017	But it's on digits. So, um, uh, a colleague at S_R_I developed a improved version of M_M_I_E training.
Bmr019	2942.297	2942.810	me013	Uh-huh.
Bmr019	2942.810	2949.181	mn017	And he tested it mostly on digits because it's sort of a - you know, it doesn't take weeks to train it.
Bmr019	2949.039	2949.949	me013	Right.
Bmr019	2949.181	2949.933	mn017	Um.
Bmr019	2949.933	2956.536	mn017	And got some very impressive results, um, with, you know, discriminative, uh, Gaussian training.
Bmr019	2957.821	2967.880	mn017	Um, you know, like, um, error rates go from - I don't know, in very noisy environment, like from, uh, uh -
Bmr019	2970.109	2981.933	mn017	I for- now I - O_K, now I have the order of magnit- I'm not sure about the order of magnitude. Was it like from ten percent to eight percent or from e- e- you know, point - you know, from one percent to point eight percent? I mean, it's a -
Bmr019	2980.217	2984.707	me013	H- i- it got - it got better. Yeah, yeah.
Bmr019	2982.190	2984.920	mn017	It got better. That's the important thing. Yeah. But it's -
Bmr019	2982.262	2987.108	me011	Hey, that's the same percent relative, so -
Bmr019	2982.472	2983.144	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	2984.707	2986.369	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	2985.335	2988.065	mn017	Yeah. Right. It's, uh, something in - Right.
Bmr019	2986.369	2987.690	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	2987.602	2989.246	me011	Twenty percent relative gain.
Bmr019	2988.808	2989.329	mn017	Yeah.
Bmr019	2989.151	2990.558	me013	Yeah. Yeah.
Bmr019	2991.927	3004.370	me013	Um, let's see. I think the only thing we had left was - unless somebody else - Well, there's a couple things. <find_calendar_entry> Uh, one is anything that, um, anybody has to say about <start_date> Saturday </start_date> </find_calendar_entry>? Anything we should do in prep for Saturday?
Bmr019	3005.161	3006.220	me013	Um -
Bmr019	3007.138	3008.426	me013	I guess everybody knows about -
Bmr019	3008.426	3015.487	me013	I mean, u- um, Mari was asking - was trying to come up with something like an agenda and we're sort of fitting around people's times a bit.
Bmr019	3015.487	3024.787	me013	But, um, clearly when we actually get here we'll move things around this, as we need to, but - so you can't absolutely count on it. But - but, uh -
Bmr019	3021.402	3021.987	mn014	O_K.
Bmr019	3023.178	3023.613	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	3024.492	3026.730	fe016	Are we meeting in <implicit_location> here </implicit_location> probably or - ? O_K.
Bmr019	3025.365	3026.374	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	3026.728	3038.615	me013	That was my thought. I think this is - u- No. I - I hadn't in- intended to. We won- we wanna - I mean, they're - there's gonna be, uh, <contact_name> Jeff </contact_name>, <contact_name> Katrin </contact_name>, <contact_name> Mari </contact_name> and <contact_name> two students </contact_name>. So there's five from there.
Bmr019	3027.809	3028.877	mn017	Are we recording it?
Bmr019	3027.871	3028.331	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	3029.152	3031.207	fe016	We won't have enough microphones, but -
Bmr019	3032.079	3032.749	fe016	There's no way.
Bmr019	3032.104	3033.227	mn017	O_K.
Bmr019	3037.867	3038.520	me011	And <contact_name> Brian </contact_name>.
Bmr019	3038.970	3040.030	mn017	But you know th-
Bmr019	3039.189	3041.450	me013	And <contact_name> Brian's </contact_name> coming, so that's six.
Bmr019	3040.734	3042.178	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	3041.170	3042.280	me011	And plus <contact_name> all of us </contact_name>.
Bmr019	3042.178	3043.650	mn017	Can use the Oprah mike.
Bmr019	3042.215	3044.100	me013	Uh -
Bmr019	3045.605	3048.763	fe016	Depends how fast you can throw it. It's just -
Bmr019	3046.600	3049.520	me011	It seems like too many - too much coming and going.
Bmr019	3048.952	3049.619	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	3049.336	3049.845	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	3050.269	3050.664	me013	Well -
Bmr019	3050.444	3052.165	fe016	We don't even have enough channel -
Bmr019	3051.054	3053.606	mn017	Because it would be a different kind of meeting, that's what I'm -
Bmr019	3052.508	3052.983	mn014	Yeah.
Bmr019	3053.445	3054.364	me013	Well -
Bmr019	3053.731	3055.079	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr019	3054.235	3054.611	mn017	But -
Bmr019	3054.851	3057.287	me013	I hadn't really thought of it, but -
Bmr019	3055.897	3060.480	mn017	Maybe just - maybe not the whole day but just, you know, maybe some - I mean, part of it?
Bmr019	3058.355	3059.403	me013	Maybe part of it.
Bmr019	3060.966	3061.787	me013	Maybe part of it.
Bmr019	3061.598	3063.161	me011	Make everyone read digits.
Bmr019	3063.458	3066.011	fe016	At the same time.
Bmr019	3063.974	3064.766	me013	At the same time.
Bmr019	3064.560	3065.515	me011	At the same time.
Bmr019	3064.670	3065.900	mn017	Please.
Bmr019	3064.766	3066.823	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	3067.892	3068.363	fe016	We c-
Bmr019	3068.148	3069.355	me013	I don't know. Any-
Bmr019	3068.987	3071.785	fe016	That's their initiation into our w-
Bmr019	3071.040	3072.562	me011	Into our - our - our cult.
Bmr019	3071.785	3073.190	fe016	Yeah, our - Yeah, our -
Bmr019	3072.904	3077.750	mn017	Maybe the sections that are not right afte- you know, after lunch when everybody's still munching and -
Bmr019	3080.131	3081.078	me013	O_K. Well -
Bmr019	3080.528	3083.361	fe016	So can you send out a schedule once you know it, jus- ?
Bmr019	3083.516	3086.173	me013	O_K. Yeah. I guess I sent it around a little bit. But -
Bmr019	3083.715	3085.430	fe016	Is - is there a r- ? There's a res-
Bmr019	3085.804	3087.580	fe016	Is it changed now, or - ?
Bmr019	3087.508	3097.841	me013	I hadn't heard back from <contact_name> Mari </contact_name> after I - I u- u- uh, brought up the point abou- about Andreas's schedule. <find_email> So, um, maybe when I get back there'll be some - some mail from <contact_name> her </contact_name> </find_email>.
Bmr019	3096.046	3096.521	fe016	O_K.
Bmr019	3099.338	3102.068	fe008	I'm looking forward to seeing your representation. That'd be, uh -
Bmr019	3099.433	3100.450	me013	So, I'll make a -
Bmr019	3101.957	3115.033	fe016	And w- we should get the two meetings from y- I mean, I know about the first meeting, um, but the other one that you did, the N_S_A one, which we hadn't done cuz we weren't running recognition on it, because the non-native speaker - there were five non-native speakers.
Bmr019	3102.365	3103.835	fe008	I'd like to see that. Yeah.
Bmr019	3111.930	3112.351	fe008	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	3113.702	3115.090	fe008	Mm-hmm. I see. Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	3115.613	3120.513	fe016	But, it would be useful for the - to see what we get with that one. So.
Bmr019	3119.958	3121.597	me001	Which N_S_A meeting was that?
Bmr019	3119.997	3123.861	fe008	Great. O_K. It's, uh, two thousand eleven twenty-one one thousand.
Bmr019	3123.713	3126.047	me001	Oh, we did - That was the last one I gave you.
Bmr019	3125.941	3127.922	fe016	Yeah, three. Right. So -
Bmr019	3126.530	3127.185	me001	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	3127.630	3130.934	fe008	Great. I sent email when I finished the - that one. That was sort of son-
Bmr019	3130.075	3131.420	fe016	N_S_ A three, I think.
Bmr019	3130.135	3130.541	me001	Yeah.
Bmr019	3132.120	3137.230	fe008	Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's much simpler.
Bmr019	3132.904	3135.860	fe016	I don't know what they said but I know the number.
Bmr019	3135.579	3144.722	me013	Th- that part's definitely gonna confuse somebody who looks at these later. I mean, this is - we- we're recording secret N_S_A meetings? I mean, it's -
Bmr019	3135.816	3137.299	mn017	Right.
Bmr019	3136.353	3138.071	me001	I remember the date. So.
Bmr019	3138.226	3142.180	mn017	Um. Not the - Yeah.
Bmr019	3143.340	3145.635	mn017	Uh. The - th- the -
Bmr019	3143.797	3145.062	fe008	Yeah. Not that N_S_A.
Bmr019	3144.722	3149.192	me013	It's network services and applications.
Bmr019	3145.100	3151.930	fe016	They are hard to understand. They're very, uh, out there. I have no idea what they're talking about.
Bmr019	3146.622	3148.106	mn017	Wait. The -
Bmr019	3148.853	3150.117	me001	Yeah, they're cryptic.
Bmr019	3150.805	3163.712	mn017	The, um - th- the other good thing about the alignments is that, um, it's not always the machine's fault if it doesn't work. So, you can actually find, um, problem - uh, proble- You can find -
Bmr019	3150.952	3151.830	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	3159.893	3162.878	fe016	It's the person's fault. It's Morgan's fault.
Bmr019	3164.507	3171.291	mn017	You can find, uh, problems with - with the transcripts, um, you know, and go back and fix them. But -
Bmr019	3164.749	3167.103	me013	It's always Morgan's fault.
Bmr019	3168.558	3168.973	me011	Oh.
Bmr019	3169.847	3170.449	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	3170.975	3175.405	fe016	Tha- There are some cases like where the - the wrong speaker - uh, these ca-
Bmr019	3175.405	3182.073	fe016	Not a lot, but where the - the wrong person - the - the speech is addre- attached to the wrong speaker and you can tell that when you run it.
Bmr019	3182.684	3189.570	fe016	Or at least you can get clues to it. So these are from the early transcriptions that people did on the mixed signals, like what you have.
Bmr019	3182.786	3183.300	fe008	Interesting.
Bmr019	3184.092	3185.654	fe008	I guess it does w-
Bmr019	3186.840	3187.255	fe008	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	3188.325	3199.585	fe008	It also raises the possibility of, um, using that kind of representation - I mean, I don't know, this'd be something we'd wanna check, but maybe using that representation for data entry and then displaying it on the channelized, uh, representation, cuz it - I think that the -
Bmr019	3199.585	3205.725	fe008	I mean, my - my preference in terms of, like, looking at the data is to see it in this kind of musical score format.
Bmr019	3206.139	3206.556	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	3206.180	3208.985	fe008	And also, s- you know, Sue's preference as well.
Bmr019	3208.730	3210.490	fe016	Yeah, if you can get it to -
Bmr019	3208.985	3220.046	fe008	And - and - but, I mean, this - if this is a better interface for making these kinds of, uh, you know, lo- clos- local changes, then that'd be fine, too. I don't - I have no idea. I think this is something that would need to be checked.
Bmr019	3221.894	3222.242	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr019	3222.499	3229.752	me013	O_K. Th- the other thing I had actually was, I - I didn't realize this till today, but, uh, this is, uh, Jose's last day.

Bmr019	3234.137	3239.294	mn005	Yeah. Because, eh, I leave, eh, the next Sunday. I will come back to home - to Spain.
Bmr019	3235.035	3236.361	mn014	The last meeting meeting?
Bmr019	3236.410	3237.210	me011	It's off.
Bmr019	3237.628	3238.413	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr019	3237.987	3238.561	fe016	Oh.

Bmr019	3240.056	3250.779	mn005	And I - I would like to - to - to say thank you very much, eh, to all people in the group and at ICSI, because I - I enjoyed  very much, uh.

Bmr019	3243.999	3244.395	mn017	Mm-hmm.

Bmr019	3245.723	3246.561	mn017	Mmm.
Bmr019	3246.767	3247.280	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr019	3248.674	3249.881	mn017	Mmm.
Bmr019	3250.779	3258.161	mn005	And I'm sorry by the result of overlapping, because, eh, I haven't good results, eh, yet but, eh,
Bmr019	3258.820	3283.137	mn005	I - I pretend to - to continuing out to Spain, eh, during the - the following months, eh, because I have, eh, another ideas but, eh, I haven't enough time to - to - with six months it's not enough to - to - to research, eh, and e- i- I mean, if, eh, the topic is, eh, so difficult, uh, in my opinion, there isn't -
Bmr019	3265.729	3266.224	me013	Uh-huh.
Bmr019	3273.419	3274.160	me011	Yep.
Bmr019	3273.939	3274.473	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	3282.109	3288.717	me013	Yeah. Maybe somebody else will come along and will be, uh, interested in working on it and could start off from where you are also, you know.
Bmr019	3288.717	3291.111	me013	They'd make use of - of what you've done.
Bmr019	3288.764	3289.719	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr019	3291.626	3292.477	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr019	3292.120	3292.594	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	3292.793	3315.427	mn005	But, eh, I - I will try to recommend, eh, at, eh, the Spanish government but, eh, the following  scholarship, eh, eh, eh, will be here more time, because eh, i- in my opinion is - is better, eh, for us to - to spend more time here and to work more time i- i- in a topic. No ?
Bmr019	3315.543	3317.758	me013	Yeah, it's a very short time. Yeah. Yeah.
Bmr019	3315.794	3316.389	mn005	But, uh -
Bmr019	3316.542	3320.690	me011	Yeah, six months is hard. I think a year is a lot better.
Bmr019	3316.794	3317.795	mn005	Yeah. It is .
Bmr019	3318.051	3318.627	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr019	3318.629	3319.650	me013	Yeah.
Bmr019	3319.108	3319.782	mn005	It's difficult.
Bmr019	3320.212	3328.470	mn005	You - e- you have, eh - you are lucky, and you - you find a solution in - in - in some few tim- uh, months, eh?
Bmr019	3328.470	3331.489	mn005	O_K. But, eh, I think it's not, eh, common.
Bmr019	3331.830	3344.224	mn005	But, eh, anyway, thank you. Thank you very much. Eh, I - I bring the chocolate, eh, to - to tear, uh, with - with you, uh.
Bmr019	3339.654	3340.643	mn017	Mmm.

Bmr019	3378.621	3380.819	mn017	No, we prefer to keep it for ourselves.
Bmr019	3380.594	3384.155	fe008	Well, we have a s- a time - time constraint. Yeah.
Bmr019	3380.601	3385.922	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr019	3380.760	3386.270	mn014	During - during digits.
Bmr019	3380.793	3386.892	me013	So keep it away from that end of the table.

Bmr019	3394.080	3400.352	mn005	I - I think, eh, it's enough, eh, for more peopl- for more people after. But, eh -
Bmr019	3394.122	3396.737	mn014	Simultaneous digit chocolate task.
Bmr019	3395.380	3397.971	me013	We're gonna - we're gonna do digits at the same -
Bmr019	3395.633	3396.653	fe016	Oh.

Bmr019	3405.764	3408.751	mn017	Oh, yeah. Th- it doesn't - it won't leave this room.
Bmr019	3408.319	3412.201	fe016	We could do digits while other people eat. So it's background crunching.
Bmr019	3409.543	3411.680	mn014	Yeah. Yeah.
Bmr019	3410.872	3412.596	mn017	Mmm.

Bmr019	3412.560	3413.229	fe008	Nice.
Bmr019	3412.733	3414.288	fe016	We don't have background chewing.
Bmr019	3413.245	3416.509	mn014	Background crunch. Yeah.
Bmr019	3414.565	3416.862	fe016	No, we don't have any data with background eating.
Bmr019	3414.784	3415.595	mn017	Mmm.
Bmr019	3417.100	3419.790	mn014	Yeah.

Bmr019	3419.690	3428.315	me011	It's just the rest of the digits - the rest of the digits are very clean, um, without a lot of background noise, so I'm just not sure -
Bmr019	3420.123	3421.381	fe016	I am serious.
Bmr019	3422.109	3422.702	mn017	Mmm.

Bmr019	3426.646	3436.459	fe016	You have to write down, like, while y- what you're - what ch- chocolate you're eating cuz they might make different sounds, like n- nuts - chocolate with nuts, chocolate without nuts.
Bmr019	3431.326	3435.728	mn017	Chocolate adaptation.
Bmr019	3432.348	3433.059	fe008	Oh.
Bmr019	3432.633	3434.097	mn014	Crunchy frogs.

Bmr019	3434.620	3440.690	me013	Actually - actually kind of careful cuz I have a strong allergy to nuts, so I have to sort of figure out one without th-

Bmr019	3441.301	3443.163	me013	It's hard to - hard to say.

Bmr019	3444.888	3445.638	fe016	I don't know.
Bmr019	3447.660	3454.770	fe016	This is - You know, this is a different kind of speech, looking at chocolates, deciding - you know, it's another style.
Bmr019	3447.989	3448.622	me013	Well -
Bmr019	3449.108	3450.275	mn005	Take - take several.

Bmr019	3460.853	3461.402	fe016	O_K.

Bmr019	3495.909	3499.460	fe008	No. No.
Bmr019	3496.141	3499.592	me013	No, no. Synchronized digits.
Bmr019	3496.330	3497.141	mn017	No?
Bmr019	3497.697	3498.788	me001	Oh, wow.
Bmr019	3497.863	3498.555	mn017	No?
