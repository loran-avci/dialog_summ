Bmr005	1.277	2.152	me013	So.
Bmr005	2.966	5.068	me013	O_K . Doesn't look like it crashed. That's great.
Bmr005	7.571	15.830	me011	So I think maybe what's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it's working. And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash.
Bmr005	16.397	18.178	me011	So, I won't do that anymore.
Bmr005	18.353	24.825	fe008	And it looks like you've found a way of uh mapping the location to the - without having people have to give their names each time?
Bmr005	22.294	24.066	me018	Sounds like an initialization thing.
Bmr005	24.825	27.041	fe008	I mean it's like you have the - So you know that -
Bmr005	25.952	26.857	me011	No.
Bmr005	27.041	29.753	fe008	I mean, are you going to write down that I sat here?
Bmr005	28.436	31.120	me011	I'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down.
Bmr005	31.291	31.738	fe008	O_K.
Bmr005	31.835	32.488	fe016	Oh, O_K.
Bmr005	32.473	38.001	me011	So -  So they should be right with what's on the digit forms.
Bmr005	38.001	39.846	me011	O_K, so I'll go ahead and start with digits.

Bmr005	356.429	363.022	me013	So uh, you see, Don, the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project. It's just uh -
Bmr005	360.088	360.762	me001	O_K.
Bmr005	363.329	363.762	me001	Umh.
Bmr005	368.050	374.312	me013	Uh, you know, it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have that information.
Bmr005	371.579	376.593	me011	And I'm surprised I sort of - I'm surprised I forgot that, but uh I think that would be a good thing to add.
Bmr005	374.312	377.317	me013	Yeah, I - I'd - I think it's some-
Bmr005	376.593	379.346	me011	After I just printed out a zillion of them.
Bmr005	379.367	381.012	me013	Yeah, well, that's -
Bmr005	381.012	383.907	me013	Um, so I - I do have a - a- an agenda suggestion.
Bmr005	383.907	396.467	me013	Uh, we - I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking
Bmr005	396.467	406.206	me013	I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we - we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave.
Bmr005	406.206	418.730	me013	So uh I'm suggesting we turn it around and - and uh sort of we have - anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later, uh hold them for a bit, and let's talk about the - the research-y kind of things.
Bmr005	418.730	442.061	me013	Um, so um the one th- one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a - a couple weeks before um uh about the uh - the stuff you were doing with - with uh um uh l- l- attempting to locate events, we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by " events " but
Bmr005	442.061	447.888	me013	I think, you know, what we had meant by "events" I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers.
Bmr005	447.888	456.761	me013	But I th- I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else like some other noise.
Bmr005	455.255	455.596	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	456.761	457.323	me013	Yes?
Bmr005	456.770	457.580	mn005	Uh-huh. Yeah.
Bmr005	457.323	459.111	me013	You mean that as an event also.
Bmr005	459.111	473.724	me013	So at any rate you were - you've - you've done some work on that and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we're thinking about doing.
Bmr005	459.240	460.050	mn005	To- right.
Bmr005	473.724	497.622	me013	Um, I think especially since you - you haven't been in - in these meetings for a little bit, maybe you have some discussion of some of the p- the plausible things to look at now that we're starting to get data, uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that - that uh - that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some - some - some um uh work about
Bmr005	498.980	501.090	me013	I - I - I d- I - I don't want to try to say cuz I -
Bmr005	501.090	506.779	me013	I'll say it wrong, but anyway some - some potential collaboration there about - about the - about the - working with these data.
Bmr005	506.676	507.550	fe016	Oh. Sure.
Bmr005	506.779	507.244	me013	So.
Bmr005	507.754	508.421	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr005	507.910	509.192	me013	So, uh.
Bmr005	508.838	510.352	me011	You wanna just go around?
Bmr005	511.085	521.935	me013	Uh. Well, I don't know if we - if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing, I think there's just just a couple - a couple people primarily um but um
Bmr005	523.518	525.770	me013	Uh, wh- why don't -
Bmr005	525.770	530.368	me013	Actually I think that - that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why don't you - you start with that.
Bmr005	530.250	532.955	fe008	O_K. Shall I - shall I just start? O_K.
Bmr005	531.700	533.036	me013	Yeah, just explain what it was.
Bmr005	532.955	546.322	fe008	Um, so, uh, he was interested in the question of - you know, relating to his - to the research he presented recently, um of inference structures, and uh, the need to build in, um,
Bmr005	548.491	565.413	fe008	this - this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language. And he gave the example in his talk about how um, e- a- I'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now, but it's something about how um, i- "Joe slipped" you know, "John had washed the floor" or something like that.
Bmr005	565.413	583.813	fe008	And I don't have it quite right, but that kind of thing, where you have to draw the inference that, O_K, there's this time sequence, but also the - the - the causal aspects of the uh floor and - and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it - These sorts of things. So,
Bmr005	583.813	606.806	fe008	I looked through the transcript that we have so far, and um, fou- identified a couple different types of things of that type and um, one of them was something like uh, during the course of the transcript, um um, w- we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on, and um, the question was raised
Bmr005	607.118	611.014	fe008	"Well, should we restart the recording at this point?"
Bmr005	611.014	618.096	fe008	And - and Dan Ellis said, "Well, we're just so far ahead of the game right now we really don't need to".
Bmr005	618.096	625.201	fe008	Now, how would you interpret that without a lot of inference? So, the inferences that are involved are things like, O_K, so, how do you interpret "ahead of the game"?
Bmr005	625.201	625.682	fe008	You know.
Bmr005	625.682	627.230	fe008	So it's the - it's i-
Bmr005	626.176	627.756	me011	Hmm, metaphorically.
Bmr005	627.230	644.023	fe008	What you - what you int- what you draw - you know, the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording, that um, i- that i- we have enough space, and he continues, like "we're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built-in downsampling".
Bmr005	644.023	659.174	fe008	So you have to sort of get the idea that um, "ahead of the game" is sp- speaking with respect to space limitations, that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space, and that therefore we can keep the recording we've done so far.
Bmr005	660.499	662.098	fe008	But there are a lot of different things like that.
Bmr005	662.155	671.305	me011	So, do you think his interest is in using this as a data source, or training material, or what?
Bmr005	671.328	703.735	me013	Well, I - I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him, so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data, uh and um such things might be useful for that in or- before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh, with Jane's help, look into some of the data that we're - already have and see, is there anything to this at all?
Bmr005	679.443	679.986	me011	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	700.917	701.380	me011	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	703.735	714.064	me013	Is there any point which you think that, you know, you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it. Cuz it could be that you'd look through it and you say "well, this is just the wrong task for - for him to pursue his -"
Bmr005	711.568	712.750	me011	Wrong, yeah.
Bmr005	714.064	724.803	me013	And - and uh I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that - that you looked at that - that it's plausible at least.
Bmr005	723.765	733.000	fe008	It's possible. Uh, he was - he - he - you know - We met and he was gonna go and uh you know, y- look through them more systematically and then uh meet again. So it's, you know, not a matter of a -
Bmr005	724.803	725.112	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	729.849	730.242	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	732.671	732.983	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	733.538	734.322	fe008	But, yeah, I think -
Bmr005	735.072	736.494	fe008	I think it was optimistic.
Bmr005	735.343	740.525	me013	So anyway, that's - that's e- a quite different thing from anything we've talked about that, you know, might - might - might come out from some of this.
Bmr005	741.147	743.048	fe016	But he can use text, basically.
Bmr005	744.284	748.425	fe016	I mean, he's talking about just using text pretty much, or - ?
Bmr005	744.638	745.640	fe008	That's his major -
Bmr005	747.451	755.005	fe008	I mentioned several that w- had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours and that wasn't as directly relevant to what he's doing.
Bmr005	754.759	755.203	fe016	O_K.
Bmr005	755.005	759.327	fe008	He's interested in these - these knowledge structures, inferences that you draw i- from -
Bmr005	755.202	756.457	mn005	Yeah, interesting.
Bmr005	759.545	768.047	me013	I mean, he certainly could use text, but we were in fact looking to see if there - is there - is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in - in - in this stuff. So.
Bmr005	770.022	781.554	me011	And I imagine that transcripts of speech - I mean text that is speech - probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing. I - I don't know whether it would or not, but it seems like it would.
Bmr005	779.585	784.403	me013	I don't know, probably de- probably depends on what the prepared writing was. But.
Bmr005	785.251	791.947	fe008	Yeah, I don't think I would make that leap, because i- in narratives, you know - I mean, if you spell out everything in a narrative, it can be really tedious, so.
Bmr005	786.905	787.346	me011	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	791.885	795.610	me011	Yeah, I'm just thinking, you know, when you're - when you're face to face, you have a lot of backchannel and -
Bmr005	796.320	797.828	fe008	Oh. That aspect.
Bmr005	796.703	797.404	me011	And -
Bmr005	797.404	804.038	me011	Yeah. And so I think it's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it's face to face.
Bmr005	803.921	804.523	fe008	Well -
Bmr005	804.038	808.480	me011	I mean, so, if I just read that Dan was saying "we're ahead of the game" in that - in that context,
Bmr005	808.414	808.816	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr005	808.863	813.032	me011	I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else.
Bmr005	813.340	824.122	fe008	I - you know, I - I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them. This - this one really does um m- make you leap from - So he said, you know, "we're ahead of the game, w- we have built-in downsampling".
Bmr005	816.096	816.528	me011	Uh-huh.
Bmr005	823.694	824.176	me011	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	824.801	828.341	fe008	And the inference, i- if you had it written down, would be -
Bmr005	827.536	828.728	me011	I guess it would be the same.
Bmr005	828.587	832.111	fe008	Uh-huh. But there are others that have backchanneling, it's just he was less interested in those.
Bmr005	830.659	831.024	mn017	Can I -
Bmr005	832.603	833.823	mn017	Sorry to interrupt. Um,
Bmr005	834.658	836.934	mn017	I f- f- f- I've -  d-
Bmr005	836.934	841.591	mn017	A minute - uh, several minutes ago, I, like, briefly was - was not listening and -
Bmr005	841.591	843.527	mn017	So who is " he " in this context?
Bmr005	843.230	844.964	fe016	Yeah, there's a lot of pronoun -
Bmr005	844.180	844.924	mn017	O_K.
Bmr005	844.924	855.786	mn017	So I was just realizing we've - You guys have been talking about "he" um for at least uh, I don't know, three - three four minutes without ever mentioning the person's name again.
Bmr005	845.658	846.262	fe016	I believe it.
Bmr005	855.914	856.264	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr005	856.256	866.744	mn017	So this is - this is - this is - gonna be a big, big problem if you want to later do uh, you know, indexing, or speech understanding of any sort.
Bmr005	856.264	863.443	fe016	Actually to make it worse, uh, Morgan uses "you" and "you" with gaze and no identification, or -
Bmr005	856.518	857.854	me011	It's in my notes.
Bmr005	866.229	871.809	fe016	I just wrote this down. Yeah, actually. Cuz Morgan will say well, " you had some ideas" and he never said Li- He looked -
Bmr005	867.253	868.231	mn017	You just wrote this?
Bmr005	867.587	868.393	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	871.822	873.941	me011	Well, I think he's doing that intentionally, aren't you?
Bmr005	872.842	886.038	fe016	Right, so it's great. So this is really great because the thing is, because he's looking at the per- even for addressees in the conversation, I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics. Just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice.
Bmr005	873.656	874.363	mn017	Right.
Bmr005	874.344	874.749	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	878.577	879.329	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	884.532	886.921	me013	Uh-huh. Could be. Yeah. That would be tou-
Bmr005	885.986	886.748	fe008	Can we-
Bmr005	886.033	887.248	me011	Oh, that would be interesting.
Bmr005	886.652	887.948	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	886.973	890.321	fe016	Yeah, so that, I mean, to even know um when -
Bmr005	890.904	898.381	fe016	Yeah, if you have the P_Z_Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice.
Bmr005	898.369	904.765	me011	Well, especially with Morgan, with the way we have the microphones arranged. I'm sort of right on axis and it would be very hard to tell.
Bmr005	904.685	907.128	fe016	Right. Put Morgan always like this and -
Bmr005	904.765	905.238	me011	Uh.
Bmr005	905.314	906.378	fe008	Oh, but you'd have the -
Bmr005	906.852	909.525	fe008	You'd have fainter - Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here?
Bmr005	907.326	908.419	me013	Well, these -
Bmr005	910.123	912.405	me011	Sure, but I think if I'm talking like this?
Bmr005	912.405	917.367	me011	Right now I'm looking at Jane and talking, now I'm looking at Chuck and talking, I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference.
Bmr005	916.297	921.666	fe016	But you don't have this - this problem. Morgan is the one who does this most.
Bmr005	918.845	919.517	fe008	I see.
Bmr005	920.624	923.808	me011	So if I'm talking at you, or I'm talking at you.
Bmr005	924.045	933.223	me013	I probably been affect- No, I th- I think I've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about - and concerns about "oh gee is somebody going to say something bad?" and so on.
Bmr005	927.249	928.211	me011	Lawyers.
Bmr005	933.223	937.043	me013	And so I - so I'm - I'm tending to stay away from people's names even though uh -
Bmr005	935.735	936.567	fe008	I am too.
Bmr005	936.535	940.848	fe016	Even though you could pick up later on, just from the acoustics who you were t- who you were looking at.
Bmr005	939.191	939.943	fe008	I am too.
Bmr005	940.438	942.351	me011	And we did mention who "he" was.
Bmr005	943.228	943.650	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr005	943.272	944.701	me011	Early in the conversation.
Bmr005	943.278	943.642	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	943.548	945.746	mn017	Right, but I missed it. But - it was uh -
Bmr005	944.701	947.442	me011	Do - Sh- Can I say or - or is that just too sensitive?
Bmr005	944.827	946.458	fe016	Yeah, yeah.
Bmr005	945.019	949.502	me013	Yeah. Yeah. No no, there's - No no, it isn't sensitive at all. I was just -
Bmr005	945.746	946.352	mn017	Yeah.
Bmr005	947.815	948.780	fe008	Well -
Bmr005	949.502	952.711	me013	I was just - I was overreacting just because we've been talking about it. It's O_K to -
Bmr005	952.098	961.266	fe008	And in fact, it is - it is - it is sensitive. I - I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to mention. I mean, it fits into the m- area of the mundane, but they did say -
Bmr005	952.156	953.839	fe016	No, but that - it's interesting.
Bmr005	961.266	975.646	fe008	You know, I asked her very specifically about this clause of how, um, you know, it says "no individuals will be identified uh, "in any publication using the data." O_K, well, individuals being identified, let's say you have a - a snippet that says,
Bmr005	975.646	980.864	fe008	"Joe s- uh thinks such-and-such about - about this field, but I think he's wrongheaded."
Bmr005	980.864	991.435	fe008	Now I mean, we're - we're gonna be careful not to have the " wrongheaded " part in there, but - but you know, let's say we say, you know, "Joe used to think so-and-so about this area, in his publication he says that but I think he's changed his mind." or whatever.
Bmr005	990.328	991.599	me013	b- But I -
Bmr005	991.435	1011.479	fe008	Then the issue of - of being able to trace Joe, because we know he's well-known in this field, and all this and - and tie it to the speaker, whose name was just mentioned a moment ago, can be sensitive. So I think it's really - really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there's a slanderous aspect to it, then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove?
Bmr005	1011.680	1012.916	me013	Yeah, well, there's that.
Bmr005	1012.916	1019.115	me013	But I - I mean I think also to some extent it's just educating the Human Subjects people, in a way, because there's -
Bmr005	1019.115	1026.389	me013	If uh - You know, there's court transcripts, there's - there's transcripts of radio shows - I mean people say people's names all the time.
Bmr005	1026.389	1029.309	me013	So I think it - it can't be bad to say people's names.
Bmr005	1029.309	1037.429	me013	It's just that - i- I mean you're right that there's more poten- If we never say anybody's name, then there's no chance of - of - of slandering anybody, but -
Bmr005	1036.849	1043.696	fe016	But, then it won't - I mean, if we - if we - Yeah. I mean we should do whatever's natural in a meeting if - if we weren't being recorded.
Bmr005	1038.306	1039.318	me011	It's not a meeting.
Bmr005	1041.882	1042.273	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	1043.785	1048.117	me013	Right, so I - So my behavior is probably not natural. So.
Bmr005	1046.471	1047.828	fe016	"If Person X_ -"
Bmr005	1047.832	1053.110	fe008	Well, my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it, you know.
Bmr005	1052.571	1052.895	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	1052.733	1063.006	mn017	Well, if you ha- since you have to um go over the transcripts later anyway, you could make it one of the jobs of the people who do that to mark u-
Bmr005	1061.059	1071.249	me011	Well, we t- we t- we talked about this during the anon- anonymization. If we wanna go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name.
Bmr005	1064.838	1065.412	mn017	Right.
Bmr005	1071.249	1074.297	me011	And I thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that.
Bmr005	1074.069	1079.164	me013	Yeah, we really can't. But a- actually, I'm sorry. I really would like to push - finish this off. So it's -
Bmr005	1077.221	1083.193	fe008	I understand. No I just - I just was suggesting that it's not a bad policy p- potentially. So, we need to talk about this later.
Bmr005	1083.334	1085.822	me013	Yeah, I di- I didn't intend it an a policy though.
Bmr005	1085.822	1090.620	me013	It was - it was just it was just unconscious - well, semi-conscious behavior. I sorta knew I was doing it but it was -
Bmr005	1085.847	1086.369	fe008	Uh-huh.
Bmr005	1089.096	1090.756	mn017	Well, I still don't know who "he" is.
Bmr005	1091.280	1097.328	fe016	No, you have to say, you still don't know who " he " is, with that prosody.
Bmr005	1091.593	1094.265	me013	I - I do- I don't remember who "he" is.
Bmr005	1096.694	1104.912	me013	Ah. Uh, we were talking about Dan at one point and we were talking about Lokendra at another point. And I don't - I don't remember which - which part.
Bmr005	1101.063	1101.616	mn017	Oh.
Bmr005	1101.091	1104.590	fe008	Yeah, depends on which one you mean.
Bmr005	1102.410	1104.531	fe016	It's ambiguous, so it's O_K.
Bmr005	1104.912	1105.601	me013	Uh, I think -
Bmr005	1105.294	1107.642	me011	Well, the inference structures was Lokendra.
Bmr005	1105.705	1109.835	mn017	But no. The inference stuff was - was - was Lokendra. O_K. That makes sense, yeah.
Bmr005	1108.642	1110.180	me013	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Bmr005	1111.217	1113.539	fe016	And the downsampling must have been Dan.
Bmr005	1111.233	1111.705	me013	Um -
Bmr005	1113.148	1114.759	me011	Yeah.
Bmr005	1114.215	1118.798	me013	Good - Yeah. Yeah, you could do all these inferences, yeah.
Bmr005	1114.863	1116.927	fe016	It's an inference.
Bmr005	1116.822	1117.385	me011	Yeah.
Bmr005	1118.798	1120.035	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	1120.035	1127.029	me013	Um, I - I would like to move it into - into uh what Jose uh has been doing because he's actually been doing something. So.
Bmr005	1124.491	1125.052	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr005	1125.433	1125.919	mn005	Uh-huh.
Bmr005	1127.012	1131.137	mn005	O_K. Well-
Bmr005	1128.013	1130.489	mn017	As opposed to the rest of us.
Bmr005	1129.792	1130.369	me013	Right.
Bmr005	1131.137	1144.551	mn005	O_K. I - I remind that me - my first objective eh, in the project is to - to study difference parameters to - to find a - a good solution to detect eh, the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded.
Bmr005	1144.551	1146.447	mn005	But eh, tsk, ehhh
Bmr005	1146.447	1148.531	mn005	In that way I -
Bmr005	1149.069	1149.627	mn005	I -
Bmr005	1150.145	1162.623	mn005	I begin to - to study and to analyze the ehn - the recorded speech eh the different session to - to find and to locate and to mark eh the - the different overlapping zone.
Bmr005	1163.392	1186.559	mn005	And eh so eh I was eh - I am transcribing the - the first session and I - I have found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events, eh besides the overlapping zones, eh I - I - I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh, eh, talk eh, eh, clap, eh -
Bmr005	1186.559	1192.424	mn005	I don't know what is the different names eh you use to - to name the - the n- speech
Bmr005	1190.959	1192.392	me018	Nonspeech sounds?
Bmr005	1192.597	1193.245	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1192.976	1195.856	me011	Oh, I don't think we've been doing it at that level of detail.
Bmr005	1195.856	1196.255	me011	So.
Bmr005	1196.483	1197.133	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1197.133	1204.158	mn005	Eh, I - I - I do- I don't need to - to - to mmm - to m- to label the - the different acoustic, but I prefer because eh
Bmr005	1204.158	1207.034	mn005	I would like to - to study if eh, I -
Bmr005	1207.034	1240.752	mn005	I will find eh, eh, a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to - to - to test these parameters eh with the - another eh, eh acoustic events, to nnn - to eh - to find what is the ehm - the false - eh, the false eh hypothesis eh, nnn, which eh are produced when we use the - the ehm - this eh parameter - eh I mean pitch eh, eh, difference eh, feature -
Bmr005	1226.499	1227.071	me011	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1239.747	1240.003	me018	You know -
Bmr005	1240.103	1240.751	me011	So it was -
Bmr005	1240.886	1250.794	me018	I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there's two there.
Bmr005	1241.421	1242.171	me011	Umh.
Bmr005	1249.476	1249.926	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1251.012	1258.873	me018	I mean, if it's a tapping sound, you wouldn't necessarily - or, you know, something like that, it'd be - it might be hard to know that it was two separate events.
Bmr005	1251.019	1251.497	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1252.347	1252.746	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1254.634	1255.447	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1256.957	1257.376	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1257.188	1257.637	me011	Well -
Bmr005	1258.521	1263.320	me011	You weren't talking about just overlaps were you? You were just talking about acoustic events.
Bmr005	1258.606	1259.519	mn005	Ye-
Bmr005	1263.111	1264.543	mn005	I - I - I - I t- I t-
Bmr005	1263.320	1265.285	me011	Someone starts, someone stops -
Bmr005	1264.543	1273.354	mn005	I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general, but eh my - my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone.
Bmr005	1267.214	1267.566	me011	Yeah.
Bmr005	1267.793	1268.406	me018	Oh.
Bmr005	1271.677	1272.126	me011	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1274.302	1275.440	mn005	Eh? n-
Bmr005	1274.596	1277.633	me013	How many overlaps were there uh in it?
Bmr005	1277.038	1282.939	mn005	Eh in twelve minutes I found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events.
Bmr005	1282.653	1285.407	me013	No no, how many of them were the overlaps of speech, though?
Bmr005	1285.297	1293.597	mn005	How many? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session in five - eh in forty-five minutes.
Bmr005	1289.631	1290.892	me011	Oh, God!
Bmr005	1294.368	1294.894	me011	Ugh.
Bmr005	1294.625	1296.633	me018	Three hundred overlapping speech -
Bmr005	1294.812	1297.160	mn005	Alm- Three hundred overlapping zone.
Bmr005	1297.877	1298.982	fe016	Overlapping speech.
Bmr005	1298.132	1302.788	mn005	With the overlapping zone, overlapping speech - speech what eh different duration.
Bmr005	1303.261	1303.772	me013	Sure.
Bmr005	1303.272	1303.719	me018	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1303.892	1308.416	fe008	Does this - ? So if you had an overlap involving three people, how many times was that counted?
Bmr005	1309.023	1318.659	mn005	Yeah, three people, two people. Eh, um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background, be-
Bmr005	1318.428	1328.630	me013	No no, but I think what she's asking is if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking, instead of two, did you call that one event?
Bmr005	1326.675	1327.085	mn005	Oh.
Bmr005	1329.833	1330.230	mn005	Oh.
Bmr005	1330.481	1330.917	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1330.917	1335.249	mn005	I consider one event eh for th- for that eh for all the zone.
Bmr005	1336.246	1337.587	mn005	This - th-
Bmr005	1337.144	1337.546	me011	Well -
Bmr005	1337.587	1347.784	mn005	I - I - I con- I consider - I consider eh an acoustic event, the overlapping zone, the period where three speaker or eh - are talking together.
Bmr005	1337.976	1338.704	me011	So let's -
Bmr005	1338.084	1338.565	fe008	For-
Bmr005	1338.704	1339.163	me011	Umh.
Bmr005	1347.995	1354.392	me011	So let's say me and Jane are talking at the same time, and then Liz starts talking also over all of us. How many events would that be?
Bmr005	1355.922	1356.934	mn005	So- I don't understand.
Bmr005	1356.902	1362.080	me011	So, two people are talking, and then a third person starts talking. Is there an event right here?
Bmr005	1358.432	1358.829	mn005	Yeah?
Bmr005	1360.728	1361.522	mn017	Hmm.
Bmr005	1362.108	1362.849	mn005	Eh no.
Bmr005	1362.849	1363.314	mn005	No no.
Bmr005	1363.314	1373.404	mn005	For me is the overlapping zone, because - because you - you have s- you have more one - eh, more one voice eh, eh produced in a - in - in a moment.
Bmr005	1365.323	1368.094	me011	So i- if two or more people are talking.
Bmr005	1365.756	1366.428	me013	I see.
Bmr005	1372.137	1372.455	me013	O_K.
Bmr005	1373.392	1387.486	me013	Yeah. So I think - Yeah. We just wanted to understand how you're defining it. So then, in the region between - since there - there is some continuous region, in between regions where there is only one person speaking. And one contiguous region like that you're calling an event.
Bmr005	1374.902	1375.359	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1376.028	1376.584	mn005	If-
Bmr005	1383.518	1384.235	mn005	Uh-huh.
Bmr005	1386.959	1387.890	mn005	Uh-huh. Yeah.
Bmr005	1387.486	1393.311	me013	Is it - Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event, or are you calling the entire length of it the event?
Bmr005	1393.316	1402.142	mn005	I consider the - the, nnn - the nnn, nnn - eh, the entirety eh, eh, all - all the time there were - the voice has overlapped.
Bmr005	1402.155	1402.677	me013	O_K.
Bmr005	1403.073	1403.780	mn005	This is the idea.
Bmr005	1403.780	1408.640	mn005	But eh I - I don't distinguish between the - the numbers of eh speaker.
Bmr005	1408.640	1418.142	mn005	Uh, I'm not considering eh the - the - ehm eh, the fact of eh, eh, for example, what did you say?
Bmr005	1418.142	1427.733	mn005	Eh at first eh, eh two talkers are uh, eh speaking, and eh, eh a third person eh join to - to that.
Bmr005	1427.733	1436.428	mn005	For me, it's eh - it's eh, all overlap zone, with eh several numbers of speakers is eh, eh the same acoustic event.
Bmr005	1437.440	1447.979	mn005	Wi- but - uh, without any mark between the zone - of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together, and the zone with the three speakers. It -
Bmr005	1447.109	1448.580	fe008	That would j- just be one.
Bmr005	1447.979	1449.454	mn005	One. One.
Bmr005	1448.882	1449.322	fe008	O_K.
Bmr005	1449.454	1452.634	mn005	Eh, with eh, a beginning mark and the ending mark.
Bmr005	1453.383	1453.829	me013	Got it.
Bmr005	1453.741	1464.063	mn005	Because eh for me, is the - is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral. I don't mind - By the moment, by the moment. I - I don't -
Bmr005	1461.753	1462.464	me011	Well, but -
Bmr005	1463.274	1469.294	me011	But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two. So.
Bmr005	1466.775	1469.233	mn005	Yeah, but eh - but eh I have to study.
Bmr005	1467.351	1467.837	me013	Could.
Bmr005	1469.294	1471.622	me011	You had to start somewhere.
Bmr005	1469.457	1470.569	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	1469.585	1472.588	mn005	What will happen in a general way, I -
Bmr005	1470.569	1471.238	me013	We just w-
Bmr005	1471.520	1473.812	fe016	So there's a lot of overlap. So.
Bmr005	1471.622	1472.059	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	1472.588	1475.035	mn005	I don't know what eh will - will happen with the -
Bmr005	1473.760	1476.230	me011	That's a lot of overlap, yeah, for forty-five minutes.
Bmr005	1475.085	1480.371	me013	So again, that's - that's three - three hundred in forty-five minutes that are - that are speakers, just speakers.
Bmr005	1475.425	1475.929	mn005	Yeah?
Bmr005	1479.084	1479.651	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1480.177	1480.534	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1480.948	1482.878	fe008	But a - a - a th-
Bmr005	1480.957	1483.425	me013	Uh- huh. O_K. Yeah. So that's about eight per minute.
Bmr005	1481.697	1482.649	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1483.578	1485.238	mn005	Yeah, but -
Bmr005	1483.783	1486.745	fe008	But a thousand events in twelve minutes, that's -
Bmr005	1486.250	1486.647	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1487.514	1488.103	me013	Uh.
Bmr005	1487.522	1489.534	fe016	But that can include taps.
Bmr005	1487.821	1488.378	mn005	But -
Bmr005	1488.977	1493.381	fe008	Well, but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l- in twelve minutes is a lot.
Bmr005	1489.107	1489.823	mn005	General.
Bmr005	1489.272	1489.589	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	1490.056	1490.766	fe016	Actually -
Bmr005	1491.901	1493.139	mn005	I - I con- I consider -
Bmr005	1493.139	1495.845	mn005	I consider acoustic events eh, the silent too.
Bmr005	1497.181	1498.086	fe008	Silent.
Bmr005	1497.283	1499.820	me011	Silence starting or silence ending -
Bmr005	1497.933	1507.326	mn005	Yeah, silent, ground to - bec- to detect - eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech.
Bmr005	1502.633	1503.514	fe016	Oh, O_K.
Bmr005	1507.916	1508.309	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1508.304	1509.195	me018	Oh.
Bmr005	1508.541	1513.238	mn005	In ge- in - in - in a general point of view. in the per-
Bmr005	1510.250	1510.795	fe016	Oh.
Bmr005	1511.677	1513.951	me013	O_K, so how many of those thousand were silence?
Bmr005	1511.760	1518.051	mn017	Not speech - not speech or too much speech.
Bmr005	1512.313	1512.703	fe016	Alright.
Bmr005	1515.019	1517.984	mn005	Too much speech.
Bmr005	1516.061	1517.419	me013	Right.
Bmr005	1517.419	1520.780	me013	So how many of those thousand were silence, silent sections?
Bmr005	1517.984	1518.461	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1520.809	1522.202	mn005	Uh silent, I - I - I -
Bmr005	1522.202	1535.116	mn005	I don't - I - I haven't the - eh I - I would like to - to do a stylistic study and give you eh with the report eh from eh the - the study from the - the - the session - one session.
Bmr005	1526.666	1526.976	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	1529.529	1529.799	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	1531.904	1532.175	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	1535.431	1537.530	mn005	And I - I found that eh another thing.
Bmr005	1538.360	1540.911	mn005	When eh eh I w- I -
Bmr005	1540.911	1556.610	mn005	I was eh look at eh nnn, the difference speech file, um, for example, eh if eh we use the ehm - the mixed file, to - to transcribe, the - the events and the words,
Bmr005	1556.962	1573.667	mn005	I - I saw that eh the eh speech signal, collected by the eh this kind of mike - eh of this kind of mike, eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh, we eh - collected by headphone. And -
Bmr005	1566.445	1567.042	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	1572.996	1573.710	me011	Right.
Bmr005	1573.296	1573.646	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	1573.667	1576.831	mn005	It's right. But the problem is the following.
Bmr005	1577.070	1578.123	mn005	The - the - the -
Bmr005	1578.123	1597.502	mn005	I - I - I knew that eh the signal eh, eh would be different, but eh the - the problem is eh, eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by - by that mike uh qui- compared with the mixed file.
Bmr005	1597.470	1598.114	me011	Well -
Bmr005	1597.877	1640.137	mn005	And so if - when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn - the mixed file, it's possible - eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system, it's possible you eh - in the eh i- and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike, to eh - to nnn - to do the experiments with the - the system, its possible to evaluate eh, eh - or to consider eh acoustic events that - which you marked eh in the mixed file, but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the - by the mike.
Bmr005	1621.352	1621.781	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1622.411	1623.170	me011	Right.
Bmr005	1638.845	1639.340	me011	Right.
Bmr005	1639.340	1642.736	me011	The - the reason that I generated the mixed file was for
Bmr005	1643.021	1647.819	me011	I_B_M to do word level transcription, not speech event transcription.
Bmr005	1643.619	1644.018	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1644.909	1647.824	mn005	Yeah. Oh, it's a good idea. It's a good idea I think.
Bmr005	1647.819	1660.960	me011	So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription, that the mixed signals here - I mean, if I'm tapping on the table, you- it's not gonna show up on any of the mikes, but it's gonna show up rather loudly in the P_Z_M. So.
Bmr005	1651.427	1651.886	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1656.771	1657.121	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1657.915	1658.578	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1658.578	1659.018	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1659.666	1661.123	mn005	So and I - I -
Bmr005	1661.123	1676.819	mn005	I say eh that eh, eh, or this eh only because eh I c- I - I - in my opinion, it's necessary to eh - to eh - to put the transcription on the speech file, collected by the objective signal.
Bmr005	1676.819	1695.369	mn005	I mean the - the - the signal collected by the - eh, the real mike in the future, in the prototype to - to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech you have to - to analyze - you have to - to process.
Bmr005	1676.979	1677.488	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1681.911	1682.551	me011	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1682.340	1684.316	me013	The - the - the far-field, yeah.
Bmr005	1697.191	1699.458	mn005	Because I - I found a difference.
Bmr005	1699.686	1735.648	me013	Yeah, well, just - I mean, just in that - that one s- ten second, or whatever it was, example that Adam had that - that we - we passed on to others a few months ago, there was that business where I g- I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time and - and uh, in the close-talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap, and in the distant mike you could. So yeah, it's clear that if you wanna study - if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap, it's probably better to use a distant mike. On the other hand, there's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close-talking mikes, so it's -
Bmr005	1700.076	1700.706	mn005	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1713.699	1714.227	mn005	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1722.499	1723.441	mn017	That's good.
Bmr005	1734.771	1735.400	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1735.343	1740.492	fe016	But why can't you use the combination of the close-talking mikes, time aligned?
Bmr005	1739.590	1744.886	me011	If you use the combination of the close-talking mikes, you would hear Jane interrupting me, but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling.
Bmr005	1745.222	1747.230	me011	And so if you're interested in -
Bmr005	1745.882	1752.338	me018	Were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you?
Bmr005	1746.398	1748.475	me013	Some of it's masking - masked.
Bmr005	1746.402	1755.075	fe016	I - I mean if you're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech, that's not a problem, right?
Bmr005	1747.847	1748.337	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1753.463	1753.862	me013	Right.
Bmr005	1754.602	1755.056	me011	Right.
Bmr005	1755.472	1756.020	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1755.610	1762.650	me011	Although the other issue is that the mixed close-talking mikes - I mean, I'm doing weird normalizations and things like that.
Bmr005	1761.894	1762.928	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1761.895	1767.341	fe016	But it's known. I mean, the normalization you do is over the whole conversation isn't it, over the whole meeting.
Bmr005	1762.918	1763.443	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	1766.020	1766.456	me011	Right.
Bmr005	1767.009	1767.549	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	1769.614	1773.065	fe016	So if you wanted to study people overlapping people, that's not a problem.
Bmr005	1772.833	1773.389	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1772.840	1773.510	me011	Right.
Bmr005	1775.859	1782.883	mn005	I - I - I think eh - I saw the nnn - the - eh but eh I eh - I have eh any results.
Bmr005	1783.170	1794.489	mn005	I - I - I saw the - the speech file collected by eh the fet mike, and eh eh signal eh to eh - to noise eh relation is eh low.
Bmr005	1794.646	1795.390	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1794.744	1800.891	mn005	It's low. It's very low. You would comp- if we compare it with eh the headphone. And
Bmr005	1799.499	1799.937	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	1802.044	1806.358	mn005	I - I found that nnn - that eh, ehm, pr- probably,
Bmr005	1802.081	1802.967	me011	Did - Did you k-
Bmr005	1806.358	1837.105	mn005	I'm not sure eh by the moment, but it's - it's probably that eh a lot of eh, eh for example, in the overlapping zone, on eh - in - in several eh parts of the files where you - you can find eh, eh eh, smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the - in the meeting, it's probably in - in that eh - in - in those files you - you can not find - you can not process because eh it's confused with - with noise.
Bmr005	1826.455	1827.634	me013	Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1837.149	1837.589	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1837.817	1842.437	mn005	And there are a lot of - I think. But I have to study with more detail.
Bmr005	1842.837	1847.854	mn005	But eh my idea is to - to process only nnn, this eh - nnn, this kind of s- of eh speech.
Bmr005	1848.004	1851.893	mn005	Because I think it's more realistic. I'm not sure it's a good idea, but eh -
Bmr005	1852.109	1852.558	me013	No - i-
Bmr005	1852.130	1856.290	me011	Well, it's more realistic but it'll - it'll be a lot harder.
Bmr005	1854.470	1855.779	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1854.523	1867.362	me013	Well, it'd be hard, but on the other hand as you point out, if your - if i- if - if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people - people's speech, you will - you will get that somewhat better. Um,
Bmr005	1864.470	1864.950	mn005	Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Bmr005	1867.924	1875.017	me013	Are you making any use - uh you were - you were working with th- the data that had already been transcribed.
Bmr005	1874.915	1876.105	mn005	With - By Jane.
Bmr005	1875.017	1876.172	me013	Does it uh -
Bmr005	1876.172	1882.208	me013	Yes. Now um did you make any use of that?
Bmr005	1876.631	1877.031	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1882.208	1887.833	me013	See I was wondering cuz we st- we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed. Do you -
Bmr005	1882.982	1883.412	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1885.593	1886.069	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1887.218	1889.989	mn005	The - the transcription by Jane, t- eh i- eh,
Bmr005	1889.989	1896.253	mn005	I - I - I want to use to - to nnn, eh to put - i- i- it's a reference for me.
Bmr005	1896.753	1932.168	mn005	But eh the transcription - eh for example, I - I don't - I - I'm not interested in the - in the - in the words, transcription words, eh transcribed eh eh in - eh follow in the - in the - in the speech file, but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker, in the - in the meeting, um eh she - she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh - there is an overlapping zone.
Bmr005	1932.283	1932.752	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	1932.429	1944.513	mn005	But eh there isn't any - any mark, time - temporal mark, to - to c- eh - to mmm - e-heh, to label the beginning and the end of the - of the ta-
Bmr005	1936.970	1937.640	me013	O_K.
Bmr005	1941.934	1943.085	me013	Right, so she is -
Bmr005	1944.747	1949.235	mn005	I'm - I - I - I think eh we need this information to nnn -
Bmr005	1948.727	1949.076	me013	Right.
Bmr005	1949.934	1962.206	me013	So the twelve - you - you - it took you twelve hours - of course this included maybe some - some time where you were learning about what - what you wanted to do, but - but uh, it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty-five minutes, your s-
Bmr005	1960.800	1961.555	me011	Twelve minutes.
Bmr005	1961.381	1962.191	mn005	Twelve minutes.
Bmr005	1962.206	1963.042	me013	Twelve minutes!
Bmr005	1962.798	1964.002	mn005	Twelve minutes. Twelve.
Bmr005	1964.249	1966.177	me013	I thought you did forty-five minutes of -
Bmr005	1966.240	1969.681	mn005	No, forty-five minutes is the - is the session, all the session.
Bmr005	1969.750	1973.454	me013	Oh, you haven't done the whole session. This is just twelve minutes. Oh.
Bmr005	1969.781	1971.212	fe008	Oh.
Bmr005	1970.617	1972.831	mn005	Yeah, all is the the session.
Bmr005	1973.256	1982.637	mn005	Tw- twelve hours of work to - to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part - of f-
Bmr005	1980.304	1986.675	me013	So let me back up again. So the - when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps, that's in twelve minutes?
Bmr005	1985.350	1985.780	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	1987.496	1999.925	mn005	No no no. I - I consider all the - all the session because eh I - I count the nnn - the nnn - the overlappings marked by - by Jane, in - in - in - in the fin- in - in the forty-five minutes.
Bmr005	1990.436	1991.222	me013	Oh, O_K.
Bmr005	1995.236	1996.406	me013	O_K .
Bmr005	1995.267	1996.867	fe008	Oh, I see.
Bmr005	1999.795	2012.005	me013	So it's three hundred in forty-five minutes, but you have - you have time uh, uh marked - twelve minute - the - the - the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it. Got it.
Bmr005	2011.302	2011.661	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2012.336	2014.520	me011	Well, not just the overlaps, everything.
Bmr005	2012.366	2024.310	mn017	So, can I ask - can I ask whether you found - uh, you know, how accurate uh Jane's uh uh labels were as far as - you know, did she miss some overlaps? or did she n- ?
Bmr005	2022.633	2029.027	mn005	But, by - by the moment, I - I don't compare, my - my temporal mark with eh Jane, but eh
Bmr005	2026.466	2027.157	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2028.944	2029.860	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2029.264	2030.398	mn005	I - I want to do it.
Bmr005	2030.766	2033.958	mn005	Because eh eh i- per- perhaps
Bmr005	2033.958	2036.680	mn005	I have eh errors in the - in the marks,
Bmr005	2036.040	2036.675	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2036.817	2042.152	mn005	I - and if I - I compare with eh Jane, it's probably
Bmr005	2037.798	2038.067	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	2038.397	2038.862	mn017	Well -
Bmr005	2042.152	2050.226	mn005	I - I - I can correct and - and - and - to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file.
Bmr005	2049.390	2049.859	me013	I-
Bmr005	2049.440	2051.538	me011	Well, also Jane - Jane was doing word level.
Bmr005	2051.508	2051.817	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	2051.538	2055.580	me011	So we weren't concerned with exactly when an overlap started and stopped.
Bmr005	2051.802	2052.250	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2052.230	2055.310	mn017	Right. Right. I'm expect- I'm not expecting -
Bmr005	2053.311	2053.627	mn005	Well -
Bmr005	2053.536	2066.620	fe016	Well, not only a word level, but actually I mean, you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption, you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt, or -
Bmr005	2056.226	2056.829	mn005	No, it's -
Bmr005	2061.415	2061.857	me011	Right.
Bmr005	2063.633	2064.302	me013	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2063.792	2064.272	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	2064.177	2065.027	fe008	Well -
Bmr005	2064.198	2065.196	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2066.002	2066.573	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2066.599	2091.046	fe008	Well, yeah, b- yeah, I would say time bin. So my - my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin, beginning and end point. And - and sometimes, you know, it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle, but, yeah, w- it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that - i- disrupt that unit in order to have, you know, a- the words in the order in which they were spoken, it would have - it would have been hard with the interface that we have. Now, my - a- Adam's working on a of course, on a revised overlapping interface, but -
Bmr005	2068.580	2069.169	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr005	2068.597	2068.987	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2071.877	2072.287	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2072.313	2072.746	fe016	Right.
Bmr005	2072.772	2073.217	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2085.005	2085.411	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2087.488	2088.015	me011	Right.
Bmr005	2087.667	2089.894	mn005	Uh-huh. I - I - I think -
Bmr005	2091.028	2096.163	mn005	It's - it's a good eh work, but eh I think we need eh eh more information.
Bmr005	2095.180	2103.280	mn017	No, of course. I expect you to find more overlaps than - than Jane because you're looking at it at a much more detailed level.
Bmr005	2096.772	2097.122	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr005	2096.930	2098.090	me011	Always need more for -
Bmr005	2098.890	2105.570	mn005	No, no. I - I have to go to - I want eh - I wanted to eh compare the - the transcription.
Bmr005	2099.270	2099.700	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr005	2104.481	2105.970	me013	I have -
Bmr005	2104.490	2106.060	me011	But if it takes sixty to one -
Bmr005	2105.970	2124.016	me013	Well, I- but I have a suggestion about that. Um, obviously this is very, very time-consuming, and you're finding lots of things which I'm sure are gonna be very interesting, but in the interests of making progress, uh might I s- how - how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps?
Bmr005	2124.186	2124.656	mn005	Only.
Bmr005	2124.822	2130.180	me013	Yes. Do not mark any other events, but only mark speaker - Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit?
Bmr005	2125.425	2125.785	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2127.328	2127.797	mn005	Uh-huh.
Bmr005	2129.717	2130.239	mn005	O_K.
Bmr005	2130.567	2130.997	mn005	O_K.
Bmr005	2130.704	2132.329	me013	Do y- do you think that would speed it up?
Bmr005	2132.329	2134.419	me013	Uh, speed up your - your - your marking?
Bmr005	2134.778	2136.138	mn005	I - I - I - I w-
Bmr005	2136.688	2139.839	mn005	I - I wanted to - nnn, I don't understand very.
Bmr005	2140.372	2146.995	me013	It took you a long time to mark twelve minutes. Now, my suggestion was for the other thirty-three -
Bmr005	2141.824	2142.224	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2143.236	2144.275	mn005	Oh, yeah, yeah.
Bmr005	2145.969	2148.702	mn005	On- only to mark - only to mark overlapping zone, but -
Bmr005	2148.400	2155.585	me013	Yeah, and my question is, if you did that, if you followed my suggestion, would it take much less time?
Bmr005	2156.354	2168.095	mn005	Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah sure. Sure sure. Sure, because I - I need a lot of time to - to put the label or to do that. Yeah.
Bmr005	2158.252	2163.697	me013	Yeah O_K. Then I think it's a good idea. Then I think it's a good idea, because it-
Bmr005	2167.542	2170.694	me013	Yeah, I mean, we- we know that there's noise.
Bmr005	2167.848	2168.211	me011	And-
Bmr005	2170.281	2170.770	mn005	Uh-huh.
Bmr005	2170.694	2182.748	me013	There's - there's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth, and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth and - and something in between with paper rustling.
Bmr005	2179.674	2180.033	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2182.748	2190.047	me013	We know that all that's there and it's a g- worthwhile thing to study, but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things.
Bmr005	2182.853	2183.699	mn005	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2188.014	2188.333	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2190.047	2197.609	me013	Whereas th- i- I would think that uh you - we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking.
Bmr005	2197.523	2199.633	mn005	Uh-huh. O_K. O_K.
Bmr005	2198.877	2199.602	me013	So.
Bmr005	2199.602	2209.214	me013	Then you can get the - Cuz you need - If it's three hundred uh - i- i- it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really -
Bmr005	2208.337	2208.776	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2209.214	2217.317	me013	And - and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of - of what's going on, much less any kind of reasonable statistics.
Bmr005	2216.146	2216.677	me011	Right.
Bmr005	2217.814	2226.421	fe016	Now, why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the - I mean, you shouldn't need to do this p- completely by hand, right?
Bmr005	2221.610	2222.770	me011	Well, that's -
Bmr005	2222.910	2224.370	me011	That's what I was gonna bring up.
Bmr005	2225.570	2230.033	me013	Um, O_K, yeah. So let's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation.
Bmr005	2229.014	2229.800	fe016	I'm sorry.
Bmr005	2230.033	2244.090	me013	So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy, such as the energy in the L_P_C residuals, such as - I mean there's a bunch of things -
Bmr005	2243.245	2243.715	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2244.090	2266.561	me013	I mean, increased energy is -is sort of an obvious one. Yeah. Um, and uh, it's not obvious, I mean, you could - you could do the dumbest thing and get - get it ninety percent of the time. But when you start going past that and trying to do better, it's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the - you know, the right detector. So the idea is to have some ground truth first.
Bmr005	2245.322	2246.669	fe016	In the far-field mike.
Bmr005	2247.539	2248.101	fe016	Oh, O_K.
Bmr005	2266.561	2271.704	me013	And so the i- the idea of the manual marking was to say "O_K this, i- you know, it's - it's really here".
Bmr005	2271.541	2274.335	me018	But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts?
Bmr005	2272.411	2275.426	fe016	What I mean is get it from the close-talking mikes.
Bmr005	2276.123	2279.912	me013	Uh, yeah. We t- we t- w- we t- we talked about that.
Bmr005	2276.734	2283.246	fe016	A- or ge- get a first pass from those, and then go through sort of - It'd be a lot faster probably to -
Bmr005	2281.897	2283.052	mn017	And you can -
Bmr005	2282.339	2283.680	me011	Yeah, that's his, uh -
Bmr005	2282.915	2295.470	me013	We - we - we talked about that. s- But so it's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is, the idea was, i- we i- i- we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway, and - and then whatever he could mark would be helpful, and we could -
Bmr005	2286.390	2287.344	fe016	Yeah, I just -
Bmr005	2294.614	2295.045	fe016	Right.
Bmr005	2295.470	2308.631	me013	Uh it's a question of what you bootstrap from. You know, do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g- do better, or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then - then do your simple measurements, uh from the close-talking mike.
Bmr005	2308.631	2311.377	me013	I mean, even with the close-talking mike you're not gonna get it right all the time.
Bmr005	2311.521	2321.702	fe016	Well, that's what I wonder, because um - or how bad it is, be- um, because that would be interesting especially because the bottleneck is the transcription. Right?
Bmr005	2313.563	2313.941	me013	Well-
Bmr005	2314.690	2317.350	me011	I'm working on a program to do that, and -
Bmr005	2321.702	2346.359	fe016	I mean, we've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for. We have the audio data, we have the close-talking mike, so I mean it seems like one kind of project that's not perfect, but - um, that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is, you know, if you infer form the close-talking mikes where the on-off points are of speech, you know, how can we detect that from a far-field?
Bmr005	2325.351	2325.661	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	2342.221	2343.596	me013	Right, we discussed that.
Bmr005	2343.333	2344.187	me011	And -
Bmr005	2345.855	2346.406	fe008	Oh.
Bmr005	2346.040	2356.330	me011	I've - I've written a program to do that, and it, uh - and - so - but it's - it's doing something very, very simple. It just takes a threshold, based on - on the volume,
Bmr005	2347.734	2351.271	fe016	O_K, I'm sorry I missed the -
Bmr005	2348.873	2349.542	me013	It's O_K.
Bmr005	2353.965	2354.396	fe016	Uh-huh.
Bmr005	2354.627	2360.000	mn017	Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand. Yeah.
Bmr005	2358.269	2359.729	fe016	Right, by hand. Yeah.
Bmr005	2359.440	2363.590	me011	um, and then it does a median filter, and then it looks for runs.
Bmr005	2364.050	2378.721	me011	And, it seems to work, I've - I'm sort of fiddling with the parameters, to get it to actually generate something, and I haven't - I don't - what I'm working on - was working on - was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have, into Transcriber.
Bmr005	2378.721	2385.886	me011	And so - I told - I said it would take about a day. I've worked on it for about half a day, so give me another half day and I- we'll have something we can play with.
Bmr005	2381.978	2383.305	me001	I have to go.
Bmr005	2383.428	2384.018	fe016	O_K.
Bmr005	2385.922	2395.549	me013	See, this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working, because we've had these meetings and we've had this discussion about this, and I'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided, but I couldn't remember all of it. So,
Bmr005	2392.073	2393.280	fe016	Right. I'm sorry. I just -
Bmr005	2395.077	2395.477	fe016	It-
Bmr005	2395.420	2397.628	me011	But -
Bmr005	2395.549	2409.600	me013	I think it was partly that, you know, give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like, partly that we have e- some ground truth to compare against, you know, when - when he - he gets his thing going, uh, and -
Bmr005	2407.918	2408.717	mn005	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2408.610	2415.230	fe016	Well, it's definitely good to have somebody look at it. I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know, the amount of -
Bmr005	2413.640	2417.580	me013	That was - that was exactly the notion that - that - that we discussed. So.
Bmr005	2413.700	2415.110	fe008	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2414.188	2414.911	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2415.835	2416.234	fe016	O_K.
Bmr005	2415.909	2416.677	me011	Thanks.
Bmr005	2416.630	2418.770	fe008	Another thing we discussed was um that -
Bmr005	2416.934	2417.573	fe016	It looks good.
Bmr005	2417.977	2418.897	me001	I have to go.
Bmr005	2418.650	2420.752	fe016	I'll be in touch. Thanks.
Bmr005	2419.220	2420.099	me013	S- See ya.
Bmr005	2419.293	2420.349	me001	Just give me an email.
Bmr005	2420.209	2420.784	mn005	O_K.
Bmr005	2420.316	2420.595	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	2424.320	2437.520	fe008	Was that um there m- there was this already a script I believe uh that Dan had written, that uh handle bleedthrough, I mean cuz you have this - this close - you have contamination from other people who speak loudly.
Bmr005	2438.030	2443.950	me011	Yeah, and I haven't tried using that. It would probably help the program that I'm doing to first feed it through that.
Bmr005	2444.020	2445.595	me011	It's a cross-correlation filter.
Bmr005	2448.050	2452.880	me011	So I - I haven't tried that, but that - If - It - it might be something - it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little.
Bmr005	2448.970	2451.340	fe008	So, some thought of maybe having -
Bmr005	2452.880	2455.920	fe008	Yeah, having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours.
Bmr005	2454.130	2455.150	me011	Exactly.
Bmr005	2455.112	2464.709	me013	But - but that's a refinement and I think we wanna see - try the simple thing first, cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y- y- yo- you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first.
Bmr005	2455.150	2455.791	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	2456.220	2457.410	fe008	That's what we were discussing.
Bmr005	2461.536	2462.188	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	2465.330	2491.077	me013	But uh, having - having somebody have some experience, again, with - with uh - with marking it from a human standpoint, we're - I mean, I don't expect Jose to - to do it for uh f- fifty hours of - of speech, but I mean we - if uh - if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it, say, for forty-five minutes, then at least we'd have three hundred examples of it. And when - when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different.
Bmr005	2482.332	2482.903	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2483.364	2483.996	mn005	Sure.
Bmr005	2484.111	2484.730	mn005	Sure.
Bmr005	2485.948	2486.631	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2489.510	2490.700	fe016	Oh yeah, definitely.
Bmr005	2490.228	2490.997	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2490.622	2502.153	me018	You know, I did - I did uh something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs, and it works pretty well. I mean, i- almost exactly what you described, an energy detector with a median filter, you look for runs.
Bmr005	2502.530	2504.800	me018	And uh, you know, you can -
Bmr005	2503.770	2505.860	me011	It seemed like the right thing to do.
Bmr005	2505.060	2508.823	me018	Yeah. I mean, you - you can get y- I mean, you get them pretty close.
Bmr005	2507.483	2509.660	me011	That was with zero literature search.
Bmr005	2508.995	2517.840	me018	And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to - to do it. Yeah.
Bmr005	2515.850	2517.260	me011	That's good validation.
Bmr005	2517.840	2519.700	fe008	Is this proprietary?
Bmr005	2519.840	2521.940	me011	Yeah, do you have a patent on it?
Bmr005	2519.881	2520.499	me018	Uh.
Bmr005	2521.200	2523.240	me018	No. No.
Bmr005	2523.840	2525.170	me018	It was when I was working for the government.
Bmr005	2525.730	2528.400	me013	Oh, then everybody owns it. It's the people.
Bmr005	2527.710	2531.050	fe008	Well, I mean, is this something that we could just co-opt, or is it - ? No. O_K.
Bmr005	2530.369	2530.760	me018	Nah.
Bmr005	2531.360	2535.376	me013	Well, i- i- i- he's pretty close, anyway. I think - I think it's -
Bmr005	2533.000	2535.124	me018	Yeah, he's - it - it doesn't take a long time.
Bmr005	2533.252	2533.800	fe008	Right.
Bmr005	2533.800	2534.790	me011	Just output.
Bmr005	2533.800	2538.810	fe008	I just thought if it was tried and true, then - and he's gone through additional levels of - of development.
Bmr005	2536.896	2541.524	me011	Although if you - if you have some parameters like what's a good window size for the median filter -
Bmr005	2537.228	2537.884	me018	Yeah.
Bmr005	2542.380	2545.759	me018	Oh! I have to remember. I'll think about it, and try to remember.
Bmr005	2546.750	2549.580	mn017	And it might be different for government people.
Bmr005	2548.590	2549.915	me011	That's alright .
Bmr005	2549.470	2554.040	me013	Yeah, good enough for government work, as they say.
Bmr005	2551.128	2551.870	fe016	They - they -
Bmr005	2551.870	2554.470	me018	Di- dif- different - different bandwidth.
Bmr005	2552.055	2552.526	mn017	They d-
Bmr005	2553.578	2557.160	me011	I was doing pretty short, you know, tenth of a second, sorts of numbers.
Bmr005	2554.001	2554.566	mn005	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2559.048	2559.542	mn017	O_K.
Bmr005	2560.560	2561.680	me013	Uh,
Bmr005	2562.590	2566.480	me013	I don't know, it - if - if we want to uh -
Bmr005	2570.877	2575.110	me013	So, uh, maybe we should move on to other - other things in limited time.
Bmr005	2573.260	2583.230	fe008	Can I ask one question about his statistics? So - so in the tw- twelve minutes, um, if we took three hundred and divided it by four, which is about the length of twelve minutes, i-
Bmr005	2575.750	2576.450	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	2577.717	2578.412	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2583.230	2590.830	fe008	Um, I'd expect like there should be seventy-five overlaps. Did you find uh more than seventy-five overlaps in that period, or - ?
Bmr005	2590.470	2591.107	mn005	More than?
Bmr005	2591.416	2594.640	fe008	More than - How many overlaps in your twelve minutes?
Bmr005	2592.980	2595.800	mn005	How many? Eh, not  I-
Bmr005	2596.080	2606.447	mn005	Onl- only I - I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the but eh I - I don't co- eh - I don't count eh the - the overlap.
Bmr005	2600.158	2600.639	fe008	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2600.200	2600.920	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	2605.200	2606.930	fe008	The overlaps. O_K.
Bmr005	2606.447	2608.230	mn005	I consider I - I - The - the nnn -
Bmr005	2608.528	2612.290	mn005	The - the three hundred is eh considered only you - your transcription.
Bmr005	2612.290	2616.000	mn005	I have to - to finish transcribing.
Bmr005	2616.760	2617.238	mn005	So.
Bmr005	2617.210	2622.541	me011	I b- I bet they're more, because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than - than sort of the middle.
Bmr005	2622.940	2623.547	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2623.050	2623.972	me011	Middle or end.
Bmr005	2624.162	2624.879	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2624.240	2633.460	me011	Because i- we're - we're dealing with the - Uh, in the early meetings, we're recording while we're saying who's talking on what microphone, and things like that, and that seems to be a lot of overlap.
Bmr005	2624.320	2625.390	fe008	I'm not sure.
Bmr005	2630.732	2631.254	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2633.977	2634.650	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2634.165	2639.100	fe008	I think it's an empirical question. I think we could find that out. I'm - I'm not sure that the beginning had more.
Bmr005	2635.708	2636.426	mn005	Yeah.
Bmr005	2635.889	2636.568	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	2640.660	2647.010	me013	So - so I was gonna ask, I guess about any - any other things that - that - that either of you wanted to talk about, especially since
Bmr005	2647.350	2651.362	me013	Andreas is leaving in five minutes, that - that you wanna go with.
Bmr005	2649.450	2657.990	fe016	Can I just ask about the data, like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data, just cuz I'm -
Bmr005	2658.780	2667.850	fe016	I wanted to get a feel for that to sort of be able to know what - what can be done first and like how many meetings are we recording and -
Bmr005	2664.100	2666.530	me013	Right so there's this - this -
Bmr005	2667.490	2670.430	me013	There's this forty-five minute piece that Jane transcribed.
Bmr005	2670.950	2676.619	me013	That piece was then uh sent to I_B_M so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point.
Bmr005	2677.097	2684.550	me013	Then there's s- a larger piece that's been recorded and uh put on C_D-ROM and sent uh to I_B_M.
Bmr005	2685.350	2688.750	me013	Right? And then we don't know.
Bmr005	2687.860	2693.040	fe016	How many meetings is that? Like - how many - t- ten - It's like ten meetings or something?
Bmr005	2689.170	2689.760	me011	What's that?
Bmr005	2689.760	2691.670	me013	That was about ten hours, and there was about -
Bmr005	2692.560	2694.731	me011	Yeah, something like that. And then - then we r-
Bmr005	2693.040	2694.092	fe016	Uh-huh. O_K.
Bmr005	2694.081	2695.871	me018	Ten meetings that have been sent to I_B_M?
Bmr005	2695.770	2696.338	fe016	And -
Bmr005	2695.900	2696.640	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	2695.920	2700.050	me011	Well, I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the missing files.
Bmr005	2697.400	2698.320	me013	Oh.
Bmr005	2697.716	2698.414	fe016	O_K.
Bmr005	2700.050	2702.630	me013	Oh, that's right, that had - those have not been sent.
Bmr005	2702.720	2705.510	me018	H- how many total have we recorded now, altogether?
Bmr005	2705.510	2708.160	me013	We're saying about twelve hours.
Bmr005	2706.004	2708.740	me011	About twelve by now. Twelve or thirteen.
Bmr005	2706.997	2707.723	fe016	Uh-huh.
Bmr005	2708.260	2713.500	fe016	And we're recording only this meeting, like continuously we're only recording this one now? or - ? O_K.
Bmr005	2711.730	2712.118	me013	No.
Bmr005	2712.202	2712.829	me011	Nope.
Bmr005	2712.590	2723.202	me013	No, so the - the - that's the - that's the biggest one - uh, chunk so far, but there's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys.
Bmr005	2713.500	2714.700	me018	It was the morning one.
Bmr005	2714.694	2715.530	fe016	O_K.
Bmr005	2721.120	2721.870	me011	Jerry.
Bmr005	2723.100	2725.540	fe016	Do they meet every week, or every -
Bmr005	2723.202	2724.236	me013	And then there -
Bmr005	2724.236	2749.041	me013	Uh, they do. w- w- And we talked to them about recording some more and we're going to, uh, we've started having a morning meeting, today uh i- starting a w- a week or two ago, on the uh front-end issues, and we're recording those, uh there's a network services and applications group here who's agreed to have their meetings recorded, and we're gonna start recording them. They're - They meet on Tuesdays. We're gonna start recording them next week.
Bmr005	2743.898	2744.449	fe016	Great.
Bmr005	2749.041	2762.767	me013	So actually, we're gonna h- start having a - a pretty significant chunk and so, you know, Adam's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy, and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff - things like that, now that uh - the things are starting to happen.
Bmr005	2762.767	2781.651	me013	So right now, yeah, I th- I'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings, but there are scattered other meetings in it and that - that amount is gonna grow uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately - i- if we're - if we collect fifty or sixty hours, the meeting meetings it will probably be, you know, twenty or thirty percent of it, not - not - not eighty or ninety. But.
Bmr005	2782.030	2787.470	fe016	So there's probably - there's three to four a week, that we're aiming for.
Bmr005	2785.352	2786.810	me011	That's what we're aiming for.
Bmr005	2786.920	2787.680	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	2787.740	2790.110	fe016	And they're each about an hour or something.
Bmr005	2789.320	2790.740	me013	Yeah, yeah.
Bmr005	2789.630	2790.697	me011	Although - Yeah.
Bmr005	2791.060	2794.460	me011	We'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not.
Bmr005	2792.800	2794.137	fe016	So - O_K.
Bmr005	2792.910	2807.650	me013	Yeah and th- the - the other thing is I'm not pos- I'm sort of thinking as we've been through this a few times, that I really don't know - maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty, but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits.
Bmr005	2807.532	2807.994	me011	Right.
Bmr005	2808.270	2813.793	me013	Because it's just an added bunch of weird stuff. And, you know, we - we h- we're highly motivated.
Bmr005	2809.857	2810.338	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr005	2813.793	2819.150	me013	Uh in fact, the morning group is really motivated cuz they're working on connected digits, so it's -
Bmr005	2817.660	2822.672	me011	Actually that's something I wanted to ask, is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits.
Bmr005	2822.766	2823.444	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	2823.081	2827.187	me011	We don't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we're reading them and I have those.
Bmr005	2826.870	2827.620	fe016	Right.
Bmr005	2826.910	2827.227	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	2827.187	2834.736	me011	And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance. But I haven't been ru- I haven't been doing that.
Bmr005	2835.300	2839.240	me011	Um, if I did that, is someone gonna be working on it?
Bmr005	2838.480	2848.630	me013	Uh, yeah, I - I think definitely s- so- Absolutely. Yeah, whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that.
Bmr005	2840.481	2841.973	me011	I mean, is it something of interest?
Bmr005	2842.560	2842.966	me011	O_K.
Bmr005	2842.585	2843.517	mn017	Hmm.
Bmr005	2845.060	2845.536	me011	I mean, I-
Bmr005	2847.000	2849.591	me011	I'm - I'm interested in it, I just don't have time to do it now.
Bmr005	2849.987	2860.160	mn017	I was - these meetings - I'm sure someone thought of this, but these - this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation. Um.
Bmr005	2850.410	2850.861	me011	So
Bmr005	2858.871	2859.317	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	2859.846	2860.339	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	2860.870	2862.436	fe016	Actually I have o-
Bmr005	2861.086	2867.730	me011	I - I would really like someone to do adaptation. So if we got someone interested in that, I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder.
Bmr005	2862.732	2863.516	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2865.970	2866.650	me013	Well -
Bmr005	2867.730	2882.323	me013	I mean, one of the things I wanted to do, uh, that I- I talked to - to Don about, is one of the possible things he could do or m- also, we could have someone else do it, is to do block echo cancellation, to try to get rid of some of the effects of the - the - the far-field effects.
Bmr005	2868.833	2870.463	me011	Since it's the same people over and over.
Bmr005	2871.949	2872.604	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2881.865	2882.693	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2882.323	2906.148	me013	Um, I mean we have - the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation because people move around, and uh, if - if it's - if it's uh not a simple echo, like a cross-talk kind of echo, but it's actually room acoustics, it's - it's - it's - you can't really do inversion, and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something - It may - you -
Bmr005	2897.315	2898.391	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2906.148	2919.544	me013	Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we've taken is more "lets come up with feature approaches and multi-stream approaches and so forth, that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal".
Bmr005	2909.593	2910.394	mn017	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	2920.070	2921.408	me013	Uh, that's the party line.
Bmr005	2921.408	2957.557	me013	But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always, you know, sort of dangerous. It's good - good to sort of test them, actually. And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do. So that's something I'd like somebody to do at some point, just take these digits, take the far-field mike signal, and the close uh mike signal, and apply really good echo cancellation. Um, there was a - have been some nice talks recently by - by Lucent on - on their b- the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me, uh you know, trying and change it sample by sample, but you have some reasonable sized blocks.
Bmr005	2945.932	2946.863	mn017	Hmm.
Bmr005	2957.557	2960.290	me013	And um, you know, th-
Bmr005	2959.540	2964.200	me018	W- what is the um - the artifact you try to - you're trying to get rid of when you do that?
Bmr005	2960.830	2964.040	mn017	Ciao.
Bmr005	2963.840	2967.830	me013	Uh so it's - it - you have a - a direct uh -
Bmr005	2968.490	2974.900	me013	Uh, what's the difference in - If you were trying to construct a linear filter, that would um -
Bmr005	2974.839	2975.620	mn017	I'm signing off.
Bmr005	2975.499	2985.900	me013	Yeah. that would subtract off the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close-talk and the distant.
Bmr005	2986.208	2988.850	me013	You know, so - so uh um
Bmr005	2988.930	2990.680	me013	I guess in most echo cancellation -
Bmr005	2991.500	2994.740	me013	Yeah, so you - Given that um -
Bmr005	2999.260	3009.610	me013	Yeah, so you're trying to - So you'd - There's a - a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there's a time delay there, and after the time delay, there's these various reflections.
Bmr005	3010.090	3021.380	me013	And if you figure out well what's the - there's a - a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself - adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract - essentially to subtract off uh different uh - different reflections.
Bmr005	3022.184	3031.208	me013	Right? So let's take the simple case where you just had - you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there's a - there's an echo. It comes back.
Bmr005	3031.208	3036.155	me013	And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo.
Bmr005	3036.090	3040.230	me018	So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those.
Bmr005	3040.840	3044.260	me018	Uh, just the raw data, you would - you might hear kind of an echo?
Bmr005	3044.260	3047.630	me018	And - and then this - noise cancellation would get-
Bmr005	3045.910	3059.831	me013	Well, I'm - I'm - I'm saying - That's a simplified version of what's really happening. What's really happening is - Well, when I'm talking to you right now, you're getting the direct sound from my speech, but you're also getting, uh, the indirect sound that's bounced around the room a number of times.
Bmr005	3060.240	3061.001	me013	O_K?
Bmr005	3061.001	3064.220	me013	So now, if you um try to r- you -
Bmr005	3064.340	3078.662	me013	To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons, but I - but - not to try to completely remove it, that is, invert the - the room response, but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the - the effect of some of the echos.
Bmr005	3078.662	3086.450	me013	Um, a number of people have done this so that, say, if you're talking to a speakerphone, uh it makes it more like it would be, if you were talking right up to it.
Bmr005	3086.450	3089.623	me013	So this is sort of the st- the straight-forward approach.
Bmr005	3089.623	3107.968	me013	You say I - I - I want to use this uh - this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos. So you construct a filter, and you have this - this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh - gets subtracted off from the original speech.
Bmr005	3107.968	3111.795	me013	Then you try to - you try to minimize the energy in some sense.
Bmr005	3111.795	3115.680	me013	And so um - uh with some constraints.
Bmr005	3114.430	3117.118	me018	Kind of a clean up thing, that - O_K.
Bmr005	3115.680	3129.690	me013	It's a clean up thing. Right. So, echo cancelling is - is, you know, commonly done in telephony, and - and - and it's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you - if, you know, you're gonna be talking some distance from a mike.
Bmr005	3130.210	3131.687	me018	When uh,
Bmr005	3132.080	3144.110	me018	I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at B_B_N over the phone, they had a um - some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me, it would come on and we'd hear all this noise.
Bmr005	3144.110	3144.500	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	3144.500	3148.600	me018	And then it was uh - And then it would come on and it was very clear, you know.
Bmr005	3147.840	3152.760	me013	Right. So it's taking samples, it's doing adaptation, it's adjusting weights, and then it's getting the sum.
Bmr005	3153.362	3171.916	me013	So um, uh anyway that's - that's kind of a reasonable thing that I'd like to have somebody try - somebody look - And - and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with. I think that'd be enough data - plenty of data to do that with, and i- for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything. Uh.
Bmr005	3172.500	3176.470	fe008	<search> Is <query_term> Brian Kingsbury's </query_term> work related to that, or is it a different type of reverberation </search>?
Bmr005	3176.710	3177.450	me013	Um
Bmr005	3177.670	3195.736	me013	Brian's Kingsbury's work is an example of what we did f- f- from the opposite dogma. Right? Which is what I was calling the "party line", which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want. We want something more flexible, uh i- i- where people might change their position, and there might be, you know -
Bmr005	3195.736	3202.980	me013	There's also um oh yeah, noise. So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise.
Bmr005	3203.227	3206.571	me013	It's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays,
Bmr005	3206.571	3213.110	me013	Then we'll figure out the right - the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those - those echos.
Bmr005	3213.880	3226.380	me013	But um if there's noise, then the very signal that it's looking at is corrupted so that it's decision about what the right - you know, right - right uh - delays are - is, uh - is - right delayed signal is - is - is - uh is incorrect.
Bmr005	3226.830	3238.476	me013	And so, in a noisy situation, um, also in a - in a situation that's very reverberant - with long reverberation times and really long delays, it's - it's sort of typically impractical.
Bmr005	3238.476	3246.584	me013	So for those kind of reasons, and also a - a c- a complete inversion, if you actually - I mentioned that it's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics.
Bmr005	3247.145	3253.298	me013	Um, that's difficult because um often times the - the um -
Bmr005	3260.202	3309.681	me013	the system transfer function is such that when it's inverted you get something that's unstable, and so, if you - you do your estimate of what the system is, and then you try to invert it, you get a filter that actually uh, you know, rings, and - and uh goes to infinity. So it's - so there's - there's - there's that sort of technical reason, and the fact that things move, and there's air currents - I mean there's all sorts of - all sorts of reasons why it's not really practical. So for all those kinds of reasons, uh we - we - we sort of um, concluded we didn't want to in- do inversion, and we're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation, which isn't really inversion, and um we decided to do this approach of taking - uh, just picking uh features, which were - uh will give you more - something that was more stable, in the presence of, or absence of, room reverberation, and that's what Brian was trying to do.
Bmr005	3311.530	3318.660	me013	So, um, let me just say a couple things that I was - I was gonna bring up. Uh.
Bmr005	3318.660	3326.868	me013	Let's see. I guess you - you actually already said this thing about the uh - about the consent forms, which was that we now don't have to -
Bmr005	3326.868	3330.160	me013	So this was the human subjects folks who said this, or that - that - ?
Bmr005	3329.480	3344.270	fe008	The a- apparently - I mean, we're gonna do a revised form, of course. Um but once a person has signed it once, then that's valid for a certain number of meetings. She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form.
Bmr005	3344.727	3358.930	fe008	I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say. So I think from a s- practical standpoint, maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings, or something. It won't be that many people who do it that often, but um just, you know, so long as they don't forget that they've done it, I guess.
Bmr005	3359.607	3360.174	me013	O_K.
Bmr005	3361.710	3368.010	me013	Um, back on the data thing, so there's this sort of one hour, ten hour, a hundred hour sort of thing that - that we have.
Bmr005	3368.010	3385.189	me013	We have - we have an hour uh that - that is transcribed, we have - we have twelve hours that's recorded but not transcribed, and at the rate we're going, uh by the end of the semester we'll have, I don't know, forty or fifty or something, if we - if this really uh -
Bmr005	3385.189	3386.870	me013	Well, do we have that much? Let's see, we have -
Bmr005	3385.740	3388.560	fe016	Not really. It's three to four per week.
Bmr005	3389.190	3391.045	fe016	So that's what - You know, that -
Bmr005	3391.300	3394.775	me013	uh eight weeks, uh is -
Bmr005	3393.212	3396.471	fe016	So that's not a lot of hours. Um -
Bmr005	3395.477	3400.186	me013	Eight weeks times three hours is twenty-four, so that's - Yeah, so like thirty - thirty hours?
Bmr005	3396.370	3397.110	me018	Three -
Bmr005	3397.190	3397.890	me018	Three hours.
Bmr005	3398.925	3399.460	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr005	3399.860	3405.170	fe016	I mean, is there - I know this sounds tough but we've got the room set up. Um
Bmr005	3405.670	3426.084	fe016	I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well, similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close-talking mikes. There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting, that don't require any transcription. So what are the patterns, the energy patterns over the meeting?
Bmr005	3425.048	3425.869	me011	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	3426.232	3447.384	fe016	And I'm really interested in this but we don't have a whole lot of data. So I was thinking, you know, we've got the room set up and you can always think of, also for political reasons, if ICSI collected you know, two hundred hours, that looks different than forty hours, even if we don't transcribe it ourselves, so -
Bmr005	3445.260	3448.278	me013	But I don't think we're gonna stop at the end of this semester.
Bmr005	3448.278	3455.170	me013	Right? So, I th- I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months, we are gonna have more like a hundred hours.
Bmr005	3455.250	3463.666	fe016	I mean, is there - Are there any other meetings here that we can record, especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of deci-
Bmr005	3463.666	3471.641	fe016	I mean, that are less well - I don't - uh, that have some more emotional aspects to them, or strong -
Bmr005	3470.770	3473.920	me011	We had some good ones earlier.
Bmr005	3472.710	3479.920	fe016	There's laughter, um I'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings, maybe with manager types, or -
Bmr005	3480.160	3481.830	me011	I think it's hard to record those.
Bmr005	3482.164	3484.240	fe016	To be allowed to record them? O_K.
Bmr005	3482.932	3483.601	me011	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	3483.092	3484.820	me013	Yeah, people will get -
Bmr005	3483.600	3488.517	fe008	It's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards. But I - but I wanted to raise the K_P_F_A idea.
Bmr005	3486.380	3488.870	fe016	O_K. Well, if there is, anyway.
Bmr005	3488.280	3489.990	me013	Yeah, I was gonna mention that.
Bmr005	3489.070	3491.780	me011	Oh, that's a good idea. That's - That would be a good match.
Bmr005	3491.285	3491.843	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr005	3491.857	3509.570	me013	Yeah. So - Yeah. So I - I - uh, I - I'd mentioned to Adam, and - that was another thing I was gonna talk - uh, mention to them before - that uh there's uh - It - it oc- it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media.
Bmr005	3510.660	3528.158	me013	Because, you know, we had talked before about the problem about using found data, that - that uh it's just set up however they have it set up and we don't have any say about it and it's typically one microphone, in a, uh, uh - or - and - and so it doesn't really give us the - the - the uh characteristics we want.
Bmr005	3518.496	3519.081	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	3523.631	3524.146	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	3528.747	3532.830	me013	Um and so I do think we're gonna continue recording here and record what we can.
Bmr005	3532.940	3544.570	me013	But um, it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say "hey you have this panel show, or this - you know, this discussion show, and um can you record multi-channel?"
Bmr005	3545.365	3550.709	me013	And uh they may be willing to record it uh with -
Bmr005	3549.864	3552.220	fe016	With lapel mikes or something?
Bmr005	3551.830	3566.922	me013	Well, they probably already use lapel, but they might be able to have it - it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant. It wouldn't be exactly this setup, but it would be that sort of thing, and what we were gonna get from U_W, you know, assuming they - they - they start recording, isn't - als- also is not going to be this exact setup.
Bmr005	3556.949	3557.474	fe016	Right.
Bmr005	3560.530	3561.017	fe016	Hunh.
Bmr005	3566.207	3569.572	fe016	Right. No, I think that'd be great, if we can get more data.
Bmr005	3568.220	3569.333	me013	So,
Bmr005	3569.333	3584.287	me013	I - I - I - I was thinking of looking into that. the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion, in fact, is that it's even possible, since of course, many radio shows are not live, uh that we could invite them to have like some of their - record some of their shows here.
Bmr005	3584.240	3584.592	me011	Hmm!
Bmr005	3585.238	3586.130	fe008	Wow!
Bmr005	3586.340	3592.317	fe016	Well - Or - The thing is, they're not as averse to wearing one of these head-mount- I mean, they're on the radio, right? So.
Bmr005	3590.010	3591.470	me011	Right, as we are.
Bmr005	3591.833	3592.231	me013	Right.
Bmr005	3592.317	3597.450	fe016	Um, I think that'd be fantastic cuz those kinds of panels and - Those have interesting
Bmr005	3597.340	3597.779	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	3598.314	3603.085	fe016	Th- that's an - a side of style - a style that we're not collecting here, so it'd be great.
Bmr005	3601.840	3605.948	me013	And - and the - I mean, the other side to it was the - what - which is where we were coming from - I'll -
Bmr005	3605.948	3645.473	me013	I'll talk to you more about it later is that - is that there's - there's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably, uh related to, you know, legal issues and - and permissions and all that. I mean, they already do what they do - do whatever they do. So it's - uh, it's - So it's - so it's another source. So I think it's something we should look into, you know, we'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at U_W also and um - and maybe we have this other source. But yeah I think that it's not unreasonable to aim at getting, you know, significantly in excess of a hundred hours. I mean, that was sort of our goal.
Bmr005	3619.646	3620.269	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	3644.081	3644.734	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	3646.008	3653.036	me013	The thing was, I was hoping that we could - in the - under this controlled situation we could at least collect, you know, thirty to fifty hours.
Bmr005	3653.036	3657.476	me013	And at the rate we're going we'll get pretty close to that I think this semester.
Bmr005	3657.476	3661.633	me013	And if we continue to collect some next semester, I think we should, uh -
Bmr005	3661.860	3680.050	fe016	Right. Yeah I was mostly trying to think, "O_K, if you start a project, within say a month, you know, how much data do you have to work with. And you - you wanna s- you wanna sort of fr- freeze your - your data for awhile so um right now - and we don't have the transcripts back yet from I_B_M right?
Bmr005	3680.050	3683.490	me013	Well, we don't even have it for this f- you know, forty-five minutes, that was -
Bmr005	3680.282	3680.642	fe016	Do -
Bmr005	3681.650	3691.745	fe016	Oh, do we now? So um, not complaining, I was just trying to think, you know, what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now and they're pretty different, because um -
Bmr005	3685.188	3685.626	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	3690.131	3690.789	me011	Right.
Bmr005	3690.260	3706.212	me013	Yeah. So I was thinking right now it's sort of this exploratory stuff where you - you look at the data, you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like, and - and - and uh - and meanwhile we collect, and it's more like yeah, three months from now, or six months from now you can - you can do a lot of other things.
Bmr005	3693.800	3694.770	fe016	Right.
Bmr005	3698.550	3699.630	fe016	Right, right.
Bmr005	3705.310	3718.710	fe016	Cuz I'm not actually sure, just logistically that I can spend - you know, I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early, before there's enough data to make good use of the time. And that's - and especially with the student uh for instance this guy who seems -
Bmr005	3714.804	3715.600	me011	Right.
Bmr005	3717.233	3718.174	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	3719.040	3732.010	fe016	Uh anyway, I shouldn't say too much, but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring, how much data will I have to work with, with that person. And so it's -
Bmr005	3731.170	3731.870	me011	Right.
Bmr005	3731.825	3734.510	me013	i- Yeah, so I would think, exploratory things now.
Bmr005	3734.630	3736.418	me013	Uh, three months from now -
Bmr005	3736.418	3748.550	me013	Um, I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing, but I think as far as the collection, it doesn't seem to me l- like, uh, unreasonable to say that uh in
Bmr005	3748.891	3757.393	me013	January, you know, ro- roughly uh - which is roughly three months from now, we should have at least something like, you know, twenty-five, thirty hours.
Bmr005	3753.284	3753.834	fe016	Hmm.
Bmr005	3757.841	3762.525	fe016	And we just don't know about the transcription part of that, so. I mean, it -
Bmr005	3758.116	3759.480	me013	So that's -
Bmr005	3760.450	3783.007	fe008	Yeah, we need to - I think that there's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards, and uh es- especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi-channel uh transcriptions. So I think that we'll need to adjust some - And also if we wanna add things like um, well, more refined coding of overlaps, then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through.
Bmr005	3764.930	3765.552	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	3766.150	3766.564	fe016	Right.
Bmr005	3766.282	3766.730	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	3771.166	3771.849	fe016	Right.
Bmr005	3783.007	3793.780	fe008	I wanted to ask another a- a- aspect of the data collection. There'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh, you know, friends, and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to, right?
Bmr005	3794.518	3802.190	me013	If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something  - I mean, what we're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions, but I think if it's a real -
Bmr005	3802.350	3803.100	me013	Why not? Yeah.
Bmr005	3803.360	3805.020	fe016	I mean, I'm thinking, politically -
Bmr005	3803.850	3805.740	me011	Stage some political debates.
Bmr005	3805.650	3807.510	fe008	You could do this, you know. You could.
Bmr005	3805.668	3823.510	fe016	Well yeah, or just if you're - if you ha- If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't um have them do the digits, or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like if it was, you know, uh, one string of digits, or something, they'd probably be willing to do.
Bmr005	3818.840	3821.230	me011	We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to.
Bmr005	3823.796	3849.960	fe016	Then, having the data is very valuable, cuz I think it's um politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data, especially with the I_T_R, if we put in a proposal on it. It'll just look like ICSI's collected a lot more audio data. Um, whether it's transcribed or not um, is another issue, but there's - there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions, or at least that you can start to answer.
Bmr005	3848.823	3854.699	fe008	It seems like you could hold some meetings. You know, you and maybe Adam? You - you could - you could maybe hold some additional meetings, if you wanted.
Bmr005	3848.894	3849.417	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	3850.010	3851.140	fe016	So.
Bmr005	3854.420	3864.670	me018	Would it help at all - I mean, we're already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings. One is uh um without doing the digits -
Bmr005	3864.767	3876.709	me018	Or, I guess the full-blown one is where you do the digits, and everything, and then talk about doing it without digits, what if we had another level, just to collect data, which is without the headsets and we just did the table-mounted stuff.
Bmr005	3876.130	3878.120	fe016	Need the close-talking mikes.
Bmr005	3877.438	3878.166	me018	You do, O_K.
Bmr005	3878.200	3882.120	fe016	I mean, absolutely, yeah. I'm really scared -
Bmr005	3878.894	3880.465	me013	Yeah. Yeah.
Bmr005	3879.990	3884.570	me011	It seems like it's a big part of this corpus is to have the close-talking mikes.
Bmr005	3882.850	3887.083	fe016	Um or at least, like, me personally? I would - I - couldn't use that data.
Bmr005	3882.880	3883.992	me018	I see, O_K.
Bmr005	3883.810	3884.304	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	3887.500	3890.793	fe008	I agree. And Mari also, we had - This came up when she- she was here. That's important.
Bmr005	3887.654	3888.173	fe016	Um.
Bmr005	3890.596	3891.715	me013	Yeah, I - I -
Bmr005	3890.680	3903.260	fe016	So it's a great idea, and if it were true than I would just do that, but it's not that bad - like the room is not the bottleneck, and we have enough time in the room, it's getting the people to come in and put on the - and get the setup going.
Bmr005	3901.689	3919.933	me013	b- By the - by the way, I don't think the transcriptions are actually, in the long run, such a big bottleneck. I think the issue is just that we're - we're blazing that path. Right? And - and um - d- Do you have any idea when - when uh the - you'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them?
Bmr005	3918.890	3927.150	me011	Well, I've been burning two C_Ds a day, which is about all I can do with the time I have. So it'll be early next week.
Bmr005	3921.228	3921.714	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	3924.062	3924.420	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	3925.490	3942.470	me013	Yeah, O_K. So early next week we send it to them, and then - then we check with them to see if they've got it and we - we start, you know asking about the timing for it. So I think once they get it sorted out about how they're gonna do it, which I think they're pretty well along on, cuz they were able to read the files and so on. Right?
Bmr005	3931.052	3931.443	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	3940.675	3941.252	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	3942.470	3943.750	me011	Yeah, but -
Bmr005	3943.381	3944.060	me013	Well -
Bmr005	3943.750	3945.320	me011	Yeah, who knows where they are.
Bmr005	3944.620	3945.990	me018	<find_email> Have <from_contact_name> they </from_contact_name> ever responded to <contact_name> you </contact_name> </find_email>?
Bmr005	3945.703	3946.325	me011	Nope.
Bmr005	3946.354	3946.830	me013	Hhh.
Bmr005	3946.830	3947.327	me013	Yeah, but -
Bmr005	3947.327	3952.027	me013	You know, so they - they - they have - you know, they're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do, right? But they -
Bmr005	3947.362	3948.084	fe016	What if -
Bmr005	3949.810	3951.260	me011	Yeah, you - we can't complain.
Bmr005	3950.848	3951.380	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr005	3952.027	3962.440	me013	But at any rate, they'll - I - I think once they get that sorted out, they're - they're making cassettes there, then they're handing it to someone who they - who's - who is doing it, and uh
Bmr005	3962.767	3969.909	me013	I think it's not going to be - I don't think it's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour, I think. It's not going to be thirty t-
Bmr005	3968.506	3970.720	me011	Yep. I think that's probably true.
Bmr005	3969.490	3970.200	fe016	Really?
Bmr005	3970.220	3971.290	fe016	So it's the amount of -
Bmr005	3971.290	3972.515	me013	It's - it's just getting it going.
Bmr005	3972.400	3975.730	me011	It's pipeline, pipeline issues. Once the pipeline fills.
Bmr005	3972.990	3993.240	fe016	Right. What about these lunch meetings - I mean, I don't know, if there's any way without too much more overhead, even if we don't ship it right away to I_B_M even if we just collect it here for awhile, to record you know, two or three more meeting a week, just to have the data, even if they're um not doing the digits, but they do wear the headphones?
Bmr005	3991.530	3995.251	me013	But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and -
Bmr005	3994.733	4002.080	fe016	No, I meant, um, sorry, the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs, maybe they don't wanna be recorded, but -
Bmr005	4002.080	4003.640	me011	Oh, and we're just chatting?
Bmr005	4003.249	4005.396	fe016	Just the ch- the chatting. I actually -
Bmr005	4003.710	4005.660	me011	Yeah, we have a lot of those.
Bmr005	4005.396	4011.392	fe016	I actually think that's useful data, um the chatting, but -
Bmr005	4009.900	4016.364	me011	Yeah, the problem with that is I would - I think I would feel a little constrained to - You know?
Bmr005	4011.392	4012.135	fe016	O_K.
Bmr005	4013.300	4015.077	fe016	You don't wanna do it, cuz -
Bmr005	4015.077	4015.739	fe016	O_K.
Bmr005	4016.364	4020.704	me011	Uh, some of the meetings - You know, our "soccer ball" meeting? I guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting.
Bmr005	4018.793	4019.234	fe016	Alright.
Bmr005	4019.234	4029.482	fe016	Alright, so I'll just throw it out there, if anyone knows of one more m- or two more wee- meetings per week that happen at ICSI, um that we could record, I think it would be worth it.
Bmr005	4020.704	4022.350	me011	That was hilarious.
Bmr005	4029.190	4041.370	me013	Yeah. Well, we should also check with Mari again, because they - because they were really intending, you know, maybe just didn't happen, but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level. So then that would double what we had.
Bmr005	4038.388	4039.041	fe016	O_K.
Bmr005	4040.677	4041.181	fe016	Right.
Bmr005	4041.841	4042.647	me013	Uh.
Bmr005	4043.196	4047.127	me013	And there's a lot of different meetings at U_W uh -
Bmr005	4047.127	4050.829	me013	I mean really m- a lot more than we have here right cuz we're not right on campus, so.
Bmr005	4048.913	4049.890	me011	Right.
Bmr005	4051.171	4056.875	me018	Is the uh, notion of recording any of Chuck's meetings dead in the water, or is that still a possibility?
Bmr005	4055.940	4059.334	me013	Uh, they seem to have some problems with it. We can - we can talk about that later.
Bmr005	4059.334	4069.843	me013	Um, but, again, Jerry is - Jerry's open - So I mean, we have two speech meetings, one uh network meeting, uh Jerry was open to it but I - I s-
Bmr005	4070.364	4078.830	me013	One of the things that I think is a little - a little bit of a limitation, there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work, we probably can't do it every week.
Bmr005	4079.529	4086.281	me013	You know? I - I - I - I think that - that people are gonna feel uh - are gonna feel a little bit constrained.
Bmr005	4086.600	4094.054	me013	Now, it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time. And the - then - so then they can just really sort of try to - put the mikes on and then just charge in and - and -
Bmr005	4089.204	4090.032	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	4094.420	4099.547	fe016	What if we give people - you know, we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something?
Bmr005	4099.610	4144.544	fe008	Well, you know, I - I do think eating while you're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise. But I had another question, which is um, you know, in principle, w- um, I know that you don't want artificial topics, but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial. I mean, we could - political discussions, or - or something or other, and i- you know, people who are - Because, you know, there's also this constraint. We d- it's like, you know, the - the - uh goldibears - goldi- goldilocks, it's like you don't want meetings that are too large, but you don't want meetings that are too small. And um - a- and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj- human subject p- p- pool, in the positive sense of the word.
Bmr005	4102.045	4104.043	fe016	O_K. Alright, alright, alright.
Bmr005	4122.317	4123.717	fe016	No , definitely.
Bmr005	4144.340	4152.680	me018	Well, even - I mean, coming down from campus is sort of a big thing, but what about or what about people in the - in the building?
Bmr005	4149.400	4150.375	fe008	We could pay subjects.
Bmr005	4152.338	4156.020	fe016	Yeah, I was thinking, there's all these other peo- Yeah.
Bmr005	4153.543	4157.350	me018	I mean, there's the State of California downstairs, and -
Bmr005	4156.794	4157.519	fe016	I mean -
Bmr005	4157.290	4163.207	me011	I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public.
Bmr005	4161.290	4162.100	fe008	Yeah.
Bmr005	4162.600	4163.480	me018	Oh.
Bmr005	4163.243	4163.760	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	4163.933	4177.458	me011	So I - I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i- who are interested in speech recognition and, they sort of hummed and hawed and said "well maybe we could have meetings down here", but then I got email from them that said "no, we decided we're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings."
Bmr005	4164.668	4166.023	fe016	Alright, well.
Bmr005	4177.458	4180.933	me011	So, I think it's gonna be a problem to get people regularly.
Bmr005	4180.472	4183.135	me018	What about Joachim, maybe he can -
Bmr005	4182.850	4192.728	me013	But - but we c- But I think, you know, we get some scattered things from this and that. And I - I d- I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the - with the radio. Uh i- I have better contacts in radio than in television, but -
Bmr005	4190.158	4190.755	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	4191.430	4194.365	me018	You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones.
Bmr005	4193.892	4194.469	me011	Yep.
Bmr005	4194.310	4195.042	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	4194.310	4203.160	fe016	Well, and they're already - they're - these things are already recorded, we don't have to ask them to - even - and I'm not sure wh- how they record it, but they must record from individual -
Bmr005	4195.760	4196.470	me013	Yeah.
Bmr005	4201.109	4202.440	me013	n- Well -
Bmr005	4202.890	4204.928	me013	No, I'm not talking about ones that are already recorded.
Bmr005	4204.928	4209.382	me013	I'm talking about new ones because - because - because we would be asking them to do something different.
Bmr005	4205.888	4207.477	fe016	Why - why not?
Bmr005	4210.800	4219.481	fe016	Well, we can find out. I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in - in L_D_C getting data, uh, and -
Bmr005	4217.895	4229.235	me013	Right, that's the found data idea. But what I'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th- who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel, let's say, of a distant mike.
Bmr005	4219.481	4220.437	fe016	Yeah.
Bmr005	4227.883	4228.619	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	4229.235	4232.155	me013	And u- I think routinely they would not do this.
Bmr005	4232.980	4245.035	me013	So, since I'm interested in the distant mike stuff, I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere and uh - But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e- e- willing to - the - I might be able to talk them into it.
Bmr005	4233.820	4235.540	fe016	Right. Great . O_K.
Bmr005	4244.740	4245.186	fe016	Mm-hmm.
Bmr005	4245.677	4250.231	me011	Um. We're getting towards the end of our disk space, so we should think about trying to wrap up here.
Bmr005	4249.310	4252.849	me013	O_K. Well I don't - why don't we - why d- u- why don't we uh uh turn them - turn the -
Bmr005	4249.699	4251.530	fe016	That's a good way to end a meeting.
Bmr005	4252.030	4256.370	me011	O_K, leave - leave them on for a moment until I turn this off, cuz that's when it crashed last time.
Bmr005	4256.400	4257.090	fe008	Oh.
Bmr005	4257.470	4258.070	fe008	That's good to know.
Bmr005	4257.590	4260.310	me013	Turning off the microphone made it crash. Well -
Bmr005	4259.945	4260.934	fe008	That's good to know.
Bmr005	4261.918	4262.598	me013	O_K.
